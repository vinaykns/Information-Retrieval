 Carbonic acid is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H2CO3 equivalently OCOH2 It is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water carbonated water because such solutions contain small amounts of H2CO3 In physiology carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs It plays an important role in the bicarbonate buffer system to maintain acid–base homeostasis Carbonic acid which is a weak acid forms two kinds of salts the carbonates and the bicarbonates In geology carbonic acid causes limestone to dissolve producing calcium bicarbonate which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites It was long believed that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound However in 1991 it was reported that NASA scientists had succeeded in making solid H2CO3 samples Chemical equilibrium When carbon dioxide dissolves in water it exists in chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid The hydration equilibrium constant at 25 °C is called Kh which in the case of carbonic acid is H2CO3CO2 ≈ 17×10 in pure water and ≈ 12×10 in seawater Hence the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid remaining as CO2 molecules In the absence of a catalyst the equilibrium is reached quite slowly The rate constants are 0039 s for the forward reaction CO2  H2O → H2CO3 and 23 s for the reverse reaction H2CO3 → CO2  H2O The addition of two molecules of water to CO2 would give orthocarbonic acid COH4 which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution Addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate With excess base carbonic acid reacts to give carbonate salts Role of carbonic acid in blood Bicarbonate is an intermediate in the transport of CO2 out of the body via respiratory gas exchange The hydration reaction of CO2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase which increases the reaction rate producing bicarbonate HCO3 dissolved in the blood plasma This catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs where it converts the bicarbonate back into CO2 and allows it to be expelled This equilibration plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood A 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may play a pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum Role of carbonic acid in ocean chemistry The oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the CO2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels  It has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the oceans average surface pH to shift by about −01 unit from preindustrial levels This theory is known as ocean acidification even though the ocean remains basic Acidity of carbonic acid Carbonic acid is a polyprotic acid — specifically it is diprotic meaning it has two protons which may dissociate from the parent molecule Thus there are two dissociation constants the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate also called hydrogen carbonate ion HCO3 Care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid In aqueous solution carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and the concentration of H2CO3 is much lower than the concentration of CO2 In many analyses H2CO3 includes dissolved CO2 referred to as CO2aq H2CO3 is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation The equation may be rewritten as follows Whereas this apparent pKa is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid it is ambiguous it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide as it is particularly useful for calculating the pH of CO2containing solutions A similar situation applies to sulfurous acid H2SO3 which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated sulfur dioxide The second constant is for the dissociation of the bicarbonate ion into the carbonate ion CO3 The three acidity constants are defined as follows K a 1 H HCO 3 − H 2 CO 3 K a

solution is fully determined by p CO 2 displaystyle ptextCO2 The equation obtained for H is a cubic whose numerical solution yields the following values for the pH and the different species concentrations We see that in the total range of pressure the pH is always largely lower than pKa2 so that the CO3 concentration is always negligible with respect to HCO3 concentration In fact CO3 plays no quantitative role in the present calculation see remark below For vanishing p CO 2 displaystyle ptextCO2 the pH is close to the one of pure water pH 7 and the dissolved carbon is essentially in the HCO3 form For normal atmospheric conditions p CO 2 35 × 10 − 4 displaystyle ptextCO235times 104 atm we get a slightly acid solution pH 57 and the dissolved carbon is now essentially in the CO2 form From this pressure on OH becomes also negligible so that the ionized part of the solution is now an equimolar mixture of H and HCO3 For a CO2 pressure typical of the one in carbonated drink bottles p CO 2 displaystyle ptextCO2 25 atm we get a relatively acid medium pH 37 with a high concentration of dissolved CO2 These features contribute to the sour and sparkling taste of these drinks Between 25 and 10 atm the pH crosses the pKa1 value 360 giving a dominant H2CO3 concentration with respect to HCO3 at high pressures A plot of the equilibrium concentrations of these different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon and which species is dominant as a function of the pH of the solution is known as a Bjerrum plot As noted above CO3 may be neglected for this specific problem resulting in the following very precise analytical expression for H Pure carbonic acid It was long believed that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound However in 1991 scientists at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center USA succeeded in making solid H2CO3 samples They did so by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to highenergy proton radiation and then warming to remove the excess water The carbonic acid that remained was characterized by infrared spectroscopy The fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid H2O CO2 mixture or even by irradiation of dry ice alone has given rise to suggestions that H2CO3 might be found in outer space or on Mars where frozen ices of H2O and CO2 are found as well as cosmic rays It was announced in 1993 that solid carbonic acid had been created by a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and HCl dissolved in methanol Later work showed that in fact the methyl ester had been formed but other methods were successful Theoretical calculations showed that a single molecule of water can catalyze the decomposition of a gasphase carbonic acid molecule to carbon dioxide and water In the absence of water the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid has been predicted to be very slow with a halflife of 180000 years This only applies if the molecules are few and far between because it has also been predicted that gasphase carbonic acid will catalyze its own decomposition by forming dimers which then break apart into two molecules each of water and carbon dioxide For a while it was thought that there were two polymorphs of solid carbonic acid called α and β The polymorph denoted betacarbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum which causes protonation of the bicarbonate followed by removal of the solvent The previously suggested alphacarbonic acid which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was later shown to be a monomethyl ester CH3OCOOH See also Carbonated water Carbon dioxide Dihydroxymethylidene carbonous acid Nonvolatile acid Ocean acidification References Further reading
