 Waterworks redirects here For other uses see Waterworks disambiguation Water supply is the provision of water by public utilities commercial organisations community endeavors or by individuals usually via a system of pumps and pipes Irrigation is covered separately Global access to clean water In 2010 about 85 of the global population 674 billion people had access to piped water supply through house connections or to an improved water source through other means than house including standpipes water kiosks spring supplies and protected wells However about 14 884 million people did not have access to an improved water source and had to use unprotected wells or springs canals lakes or rivers for their water needs A clean water supply in particular water that is not polluted with fecal matter from lack of sanitation is the single most important determinant of public health Destruction of water supply andor sanitation infrastructure after major catastrophes earthquakes floods war etc poses the immediate threat of severe epidemics of waterborne diseases several of which can be lifethreatening Technical overview For more details on this topic see Water supply network For more details on this topic see Water treatment Water supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate treatment including groundwater aquifers surface water lakes and rivers and the sea through desalination The water treatment steps include in most cases purification disinfection through chlorination and sometimes fluoridation Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to reservoirs which can be elevated such as water towers or on the ground for indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see nonrevenue water Once water is used wastewater is typically discharged in a sewer system and treated in a sewage treatment plant before being discharged into a river lake or the sea or reused for landscaping irrigation or industrial use see also sanitation Use In the US the typical single family home uses about 693 gallons 262 litres of water per day 2008 estimate This includes in decreasing order toilet use washing machine use showers baths tap use and leaks Service quality Many of the 35 billion people having access to piped water receive a poor or very poor quality of service especially in developing countries where about 80 of the world population lives Water supply service quality has many dimensions continuity water quality pressure and the degree of responsiveness of service providers to customer complaints Continuity of supply Continuity of water supply is taken for granted in most developed countries but is a severe problem in many developing countries where sometimes water is only provided for a few hours every day or a few days a week It is estimated that about half of the population of developing countries receives water on an intermittent basis Water quality Drinking water quality has a microbiological and a physicochemical dimension There are thousands of parameters of water quality In public water supply systems water should at a minimum be disinfected—most commonly through the use of chlorination or the use of ultra violet light—or it may need to undergo treatment especially in the case of surface water For more details please see the separate entries on water quality water treatment and drinking water Water pressure Water pressures vary in different locations of a distribution system Water mains below the street may operate at higher pressures with a pressure reducer located at each point where the water enters a building or a house In poorly managed systems water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of water Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a pressurised water tank serving an urban area by pumping the water up into a water tower and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the system or solely by pumps at the water treatment plant and repeater pumping stations Typical UK pressures are 4–5 bar 6070 PSI for an urban supply However some people can get over eight bars or below one bar A single iron main pipe may cross a deep valley it will have the same nominal pressure however each consumer will get a bit more or less because of the hydrostatic pressure about 1 bar10 m height So people at the bottom of a 100foot 30 m hill will get about 3 bars more than those at the top The effective pressure also varies because of the pressure loss due to supply resistance even for the same static pressure An urban consumer may have 5 metres of 15 mm pipe running from the iron main so the kitchen tap flow will be fairly unrestricted so high flow A rural consumer may have a kilometre of rusted and limed 22 mm iron pipe so their kitchen tap flow will be small For this reason the UK domestic water system has traditionally prior to 1989 employed a cistern feed system where the incoming supply is connected to the kitchen sink and also a headerstorage tank in the attic Water can dribble into this tank through a 12 mm pipe plus ball valve and then supply the house on 22 or 28 mm pipes Gravity water has a small pressure say ¼ bar in the bathroom so needs wide pipes allow higher flows This is fine for baths and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers A booster pump or a hydrophore is installed to increase and maintain pressure For this reason urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers combies which take a long time to fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower Institutional responsibility and governance A great variety of institutions have responsibilities in water supply A basic distinction is between institutions responsible for policy and regulation on the one hand and institutions in charge of providing services on the other hand Policy and regulation Water supply policies and regulation are usually defined by one or several Ministries in consultation with the legislative branch In the United States the United States Environmental Protection Agency whose administrator reports directly to the President is responsible for water and sanitation policy and standard setting within the executive branch In other countries responsibility for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment such as in Mexico and Colombia to a Ministry of Health such as in Panama Honduras and Uruguay a Ministry of Public Works such as in Ecuador and Haiti a Ministry of Economy such as in German states or a Ministry of Energy such as in Iran A few countries such as Jordan and Bolivia even have a Ministry of Water Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply In the European Union important policy functions have been entrusted to the supranational level Policy and regulatory functions include the setting of tariff rules and the approval of tariff increases setting monitoring and enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection benchmarking the performance of service providers and reforms in the structure of institutions responsible for service provision The distinction between policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clearcut In some countries they are both entrusted to Ministries but in others regulatory functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries Regulatory agencies Dozens of countries around the world have established regulatory agencies for infrastructure services including often water supply and sanitation in order to better protect consumers and to improve efficiency Regulatory agencies can be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities including in particular the approval of tariff increases and the management of sector information systems including benchmarking systems Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service providers These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and objective in regulating service providers than departments of government Ministries Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the executive branch of government but in many countries have often not been able to exercise a great degree of autonomy In the United States regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost a century at the level of states and in Canada at the level of provinces In both countries they cover several infrastructure sectors In many US states they are called Public Utility Commissions For England and Wales a regulatory agency for water OFWAT was created as part of the privatization of the water industry in 1989 In many developing countries water regulatory agencies were created during the 1990s in parallel with efforts at increasing private sector participation for more details on regulatory agencies in Latin America for example please see Water and sanitation in Latin America and the regional association of water regulatory agencies ADERASA 4 Many countries do not have regulatory agencies for water In these countries service providers are regulated directly by local government or the national government This is for example the case in the countries of continental Europe in China and India For more information on utility regulation in the water sector see the Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation 5 and the World Banks knowledge base on the same topic at 6 Service provision Water supply service providers which are often utilities differ from each other in terms of their geographical coverage relative to administrative boundaries their sectoral coverage their ownership structure and their governance arrangements Geographical coverage Many water utilities provide services in a single city town or municipality However in many countries municipalities have associated in regional or intermunicipal or multijurisdictional utilities to benefit from economies of scale In the United States these can take the form of specialpurpose districts which may have independent taxing authority An example of a multijurisdictional water utility in the United States is WASA a utility serving Washington DC and various localities in the state of Maryland Multijurisdictional utilities are also common in Germany where they are known as Zweckverbaende in France and in Italy In some federal countries there are water service providers covering most or all cities and towns in an entire state such as in all states of Brazil and some states in Mexico see Water supply and sanitation in Mexico In England and Wales water supply and sewerage is supplied almost entirely through ten regional companies Some smaller countries especially developed countries have established service providers that cover the entire country or at least most of its cities and major towns Such national service providers are especially prevalent in West Africa and Central America but also exist for example in Tunisia Jordan and Uruguay see also water supply and sanitation in Uruguay In rural areas where about half the world population lives water services are often not provided by utilities but by communitybased organizations which usually cover one or sometimes several villages Sector coverage Some water utilities provide only water supply services while sewerage is under the responsibility of a different entity This is for example the case in Tunisia However in most cases water utilities also provide sewer and sewage treatment services In some cities or countries utilities also distribute electricity In a few cases such multiutilities also collect solid waste and provide local telephone services An example of such an integrated utility can be found in the Colombian city of Medellín Utilities that provide water sanitation and electricity can be found in Frankfurt Germany Mainova in Casablanca Morocco and in Gabon in West Africa Multiutilities provide certain benefits such as common billing and the option to crosssubsidize water services with revenues from electricity sales if permitted by law Ownership and governance arrangements Water supply providers can be either public private mixed or cooperative Most urban water supply services around the world are provided by public entities As WillemAlexander Prince of Orange 2002 stated The water crisis that is affecting so many people is mainly a crisis of governance — not of water scarcity The introduction of costreflective tariffs together with crosssubsidization between richer and poorer consumers is an essential governance reform in order to reduce the high levels of Unaccountedfor Water UAW and to provide the finance needed to extend the network to those poorest households who remain unconnected Partnership arrangements between the public and private sector can play an important role in order to achieve this objective Private sector participation An estimated 10 percent of urban water supply is provided by private or mixed publicprivate companies usually under concessions leases or management contracts Under these arrangements the public entity that is legally responsible for service provision delegates certain or all aspects of service provision to the private service provider for a period typically ranging from 4 to 30 years The public entity continues to own the assets These arrangements are common in France and in Spain Only in few parts of the world water supply systems have been completely sold to the private sector privatization such as in England and Wales as well as in Chile The largest private water companies in the world are Suez and Veolia Environnement from France Aguas de Barcelona from Spain and Thames Water from the UK all of which are engaged internationally see links to website of these companies below In recent years a number of cities have reverted to the public sector in a process called remunicipalization Public water service provision 90 of urban water supply and sanitation services are currently in the public sector They are owned by the state or local authorities or also by collectives or cooperatives They run without an aim for profit but are based on the ethos of providing a common good considered to be of public interest In most middle and lowincome countries these publicly owned and managed water providers can be inefficient as a result of political interference leading to overstaffing and low labor productivity Ironically the main losers from this institutional arrangement are the urban poor in these countries Because they are not connected to the network they end up paying far more per liter of water than do more welloff households connected to the network who benefit from the implicit subsidies that they receive from lossmaking utilities The fact that we are still so far from achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation shows that public water authorities in their current state are not working well enough Yet some are being very successful and are modelling the best forms of public management As Ryutaro Hashimoto former Japanese Prime Minister notes Public water services currently provide more than 90 percent of water supply in the world Modest improvement in public water operators will have immense impact on global provision of services Governance arrangements Governance arrangements for both public and private utilities can take many forms Kurian and McCarney 2010 Governance arrangements define the relationship between the service provider its owners its customers and regulatory entities They determine the financial autonomy of the service provider and thus its ability to maintain its assets expand services attract and retain qualified staff and ultimately to provide highquality services Key aspects of governance arrangements are the extent to which the entity in charge of providing services is insulated from arbitrary political intervention and whether there is an explicit mandate and political will to allow the service provider to recover all or at least most of its costs through tariffs and retain these revenues If water supply is the responsibility of a department that is integrated in the administration of a city town or municipality there is a risk that tariff revenues are diverted for other purposes In some cases there is also a risk that staff are appointed mainly on political grounds rather than based on their professional credentials Standardization International standards for water supply system are covered by International Classification of Standards ICS 9114060 Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers utilities is needed because the sector offers limited scope for direct competition natural monopoly Firms operating in competitive markets are under constant pressure to out perform each other Water utilities are often sheltered from this pressure and it frequently shows some utilities are on a sustained improvement track but many others keep falling further behind best practice Benchmarking the performance of utilities allows to simulate competition establish realistic targets for improvement and create pressure to catch up with better utilities Information on benchmarks for water and sanitation utilities is provided by the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities Financial aspects Costs and financing The cost of supplying water consists to a very large extent of fixed costs capital costs and personnel costs and only to a small extent of variable costs that depend on the amount of water consumed mainly energy and chemicals The full cost of supplying water in urban areas in developed countries is about US1–2 per cubic meter depending on local costs and local water consumption levels The cost of sanitation sewerage and wastewater treatment is another US1–2 per cubic meter These costs are somewhat lower in developing countries Throughout the world only part of these costs is usually billed to consumers the remainder being financed through direct or indirect subsidies from local regional or national governments see section on tariffs Besides subsidies water supply investments are financed through internally generated revenues as well as through debt Debt financing can take the form of credits from commercial Banks credits from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks in the case of developing countries and bonds in the case of some developed countries and some upper middleincome countries Tariffs Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of their costs According to estimates by the World Bank the average mean global water tariff is US053 per cubic meter In developed countries the average tariff is US104 while it is only U011 in the poorest developing countries The lowest tariffs in developing countries are found in South Asia mean of US009m3 while the highest are found in Latin America US041m3 Data for 132 cities were assessed The tariff is estimate for a consumption level of 15 cubic meters per month Few utilities do recover all their costs According to the same World Bank study only 30 of utilities globally and only 50 of utilities in developed countries generate sufficient revenue to cover operation maintenance and partial capital costs According to another study undertaken in 2006 by NUS Consulting the average water and sewerage tariff in 14 mainly OECD countries excluding VAT varied between US066 per cubic meter in the United States and the equivalent of US225 per cubic meter in Denmark However water consumption is much higher in the US than in Europe Therefore residential water bills may be very similar even if the tariff per unit of consumption tends to be higher in Europe than in the US A typical family on the US East Coast paid between US30 and US70 per month for water and sewer services in 2005 In developing countries tariffs are usually much further from covering costs Residential water bills for a typical consumption of 15 cubic meters per month vary between less than US1 and US12 per month Water and sanitation tariffs which are almost always billed together can take many different forms Where meters are installed tariffs are typically volumetric per usage sometimes combined with a small monthly fixed charge In the absence of meters flat or fixed rates — which are independent of actual consumption — are being charged In developed countries tariffs are usually the same for different categories of users and for different levels of consumption In developing countries the situation is often characterized by crosssubsidies with the intent to make water more affordable for residential lowvolume users that are assumed to be poor For example industrial and commercial users are often charged higher tariffs than public or residential users Also metered users are often charged higher tariffs for higher levels of consumption increasingblock tariffs However crosssubsidies between residential users do not always reach their objective Given the overall low level of water tariffs in developing countries even at higher levels of consumption most consumption subsidies benefit the wealthier segments of society Also high industrial and commercial tariffs can provide an incentive for these users to supply water from other sources than the utility own wells water tankers and thus actually erode the utilitys revenue base Metering Main articles Water metering and Water meter Metering of water supply is usually motivated by one or several of four objectives First it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects water resources environmental objective Second it can postpone costly system expansion and saves energy and chemical costs economic objective Third it allows a utility to better locate distribution losses technical objective Fourth it allows to charge for water based on use which is perceived by many as the fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply to users Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is widespread in developed countries except for the United Kingdom In developing countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are metered and the tendency is increasing Water meters are read by one of several methods the water customer writes down the meter reading and mails in a postcard with this info to the water department the water customer writes down the meter reading and uses a phone dialin system to transfer this info to the water department the water customer logs into the website of the water supply company enters the address meter ID and meter readings 7 a meter reader comes to the premises and enters the meter reading into a handheld computer the meter reading is echoed on a display unit mounted to the outside of the premises where a meter reader records them a small radio is hooked up to the meter to automatically transmit readings to corresponding receivers in handheld computers utility vehicles or distributed collectors a small computer is hooked up to the meter that can either dial out or receive automated phone calls that give the reading to a central computer system Most cities are increasingly installing Automatic Meter Reading AMR systems to prevent fraud to lower everincreasing labor and liability costs and to improve customer service and satisfaction Health aspects Outbreaks of diseases due to contaminated water supply Water supply can get contaminated by pathogens which may originate from human excreta for example due to a breakdown or design fault in the sanitation system or by chemical contaminants Examples of contamination include In 1854 a cholera outbreak in Londons Soho district was identified by Dr John Snow as originating from contaminated water from the Broad street pump This can be regarded as a founding event of the science of epidemiology In 1980 a hepatitis A surge due to the consumption of water from a fecescontaminated well in Pennsylvania In 1987 a cryptosporidiosis outbreak is caused by the public water supply of which the filtration was contaminated in western Georgia In 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak An outbreak of typhoid fever in northern Israel which was associated with the contaminated municipal water supply In 1997 369 cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred caused by a contaminated fountain in the Minnesota zoo Most of the sufferers were children In 1998 a nonchlorinated municipal water supply was blamed for a campylobacteriosis outbreak in northern Finland In 2000 a gastroenteritis outbreak that was brought by a nonchlorinated community water supply in southern Finland In 2000 an E coli outbreak occurred in Walkerton Ontario Canada Seven people died from drinking contaminated water Hundreds suffered from the symptoms of the disease not knowing if they too would die In 2004 contamination of the community water supply serving the Bergen city centre of Norway was later reported after the outbreak of waterborne giardiasis In 2007 contaminated drinking water was pinpointed which had led to the outbreak of gastroenteritis with multiple aetiologies in Denmark Examples of chemical contamination include In 1988 many people were poisoned in Camelford when a worker put 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate in the wrong tank In 1993 a fluoride poisoning outbreak resulting from overfeeding of fluoride in Mississippi History Main article History of water supply and sanitation Throughout history people have devised systems to make getting and using water more convenient Early Rome had indoor plumbing meaning a system of aqueducts and pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use Until the Enlightenment era little progress was made in water supply and sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected throughout Europe It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in London The Chelsea Waterworks Company was established in 1723 for the better supplying the City and Liberties of Westminster and parts adjacent with water Other waterworks were established in London including at West Ham in 1743 at Lea Bridge before 1767 Lambeth Waterworks Company in 1785 West Middlesex Waterworks Company in 1806 and Grand Junction Waterworks Company in 1811 The Sbend pipe was invented by Alexander Cummings in 1775 but became known as the Ubend following the introduction of the Ushaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880 The first screwdown water tap was patented in 1845 by Guest and Chrimes a brass foundry in Rotherham In ancient Peru the Nazca people employed a system of interconnected wells and an underground watercourse known as puquios In Spain and Spanish America a community operated watercourse known as an acequia combined with a simple sand filtration system provided potable water Beginning in the Roman era a water wheel device known as a noria supplied water to aqueducts and other water distribution systems in major cities in Europe and the Middle East London water supply infrastructure developed over many centuries from early mediaeval conduits through major 19th century treatment works built in response to cholera threats to modern large scale reservoirs Water towers appeared around the late 19th century as building height rose and steam electric and dieselpowered water pumps became available As skyscrapers appeared they needed rooftop water towers The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed in 1910 by US Army Major later Brig Gen Carl Rogers Darnall 1867–1941 Professor of Chemistry at the Army Medical School Shortly thereafter Major later Col William J L Lyster 1869–1947 of the Army Medical Department used a solution of calcium hypochlorite in a linen bag to treat water For many decades Lysters method remained the standard for US ground forces in the field and in camps implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag also spelled Lister Bag Darnalls work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water purification Desalination appeared during the late 20th century and is still limited to a few areas During the beginning of the 21st Century especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers traditional centralized infrastructure have not been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand Among several options that have been managed are the extensive use of desalination technology this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in dry countries like Australia Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including Rainwater harvesting and Stormwater harvesting where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as Fit for Purpose Water treatment The first documented use of sand filters to purify the water supply dates to 1804 when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley Scotland John Gibb installed an experimental filter selling his unwanted surplus to the public The first treated public water supply in the world was installed by engineer James Simpson for the Chelsea Waterworks Company in London in 1829 The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician John Snow during the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic The Metropolis Water Act introduced regulation of the water supply companies in London including minimum standards of water quality for the first time The Act made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water and required that all water be effectually filtered from 31 December 1855 This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across Europe Permanent water chlorination began in 1905 when a faulty slow sand filter and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln England Dr Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated The first continuous use of chlorine in the United States for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir on the Rockaway River which served as the supply for Jersey City New Jersey Desalination appeared during the late 20th century and is still limited to a few areas The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian Medical Service Vincent B Nesfield in 1903 US Army Major Carl Rogers Darnall Professor of Chemistry at the Army Medical School gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910 This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water purification Society and culture Women and water supply
