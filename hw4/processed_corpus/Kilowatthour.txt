 KWH redirects here For other uses see KWH disambiguation The kilowatthour symbol kWh kW⋅h or kW h is a derived unit of energy equal to 36 megajoules If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate power over a period of time the total energy in kilowatthours is the power in kilowatts multiplied by the time in hours The kilowatthour is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities Definition The kilowatthour symbolized kW⋅h as per SI is a composite unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt 1 kW of power sustained for one hour One watt is equal to 1 Js One kilowatthour is 36 megajoules which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour The base unit of energy within the International System of Units SI is the joule The hour is a unit of time outside the SI making the kilowatthour a nonSI unit of energy The kilowatthour is not listed among the nonSI units accepted by the BIPM for use with the SI although the hour from which the kilowatthour is derived is Examples An electric heater rated at 1000 watts 1 kilowatt operating for one hour uses one kilowatthour equivalent to 36 megajoules of energy A television rated at 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatthour A 40watt light bulb operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatthour Electrical energy is sold in kilowatthours cost of running equipment is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours and price per kilowatthour The unit price of electricity may depend upon the rate of consumption and the time of day Industrial users may also have extra charges according to their peak usage and the power factor Symbol and abbreviations for kilowatthour The symbol kWh is commonly used in commercial educational scientific and media publications and is the usual practice in electrical power engineering Other abbreviations and symbols may be encountered kW h is less commonly used It is consistent with SI standards but note that the kilowatthour is a nonSI unit The international standard for SI states that in forming a compound unit symbol Multiplication must be indicated by a space or a halfhigh centered dot · since otherwise some prefixes could be misinterpreted as a unit symbol ie kW h or kW·h This is supported by a voluntary standard issued jointly by an international IEEE and national ASTM organization However at least one major usage guide and the IEEEASTM standard allow kWh but do not mention other multiples of the watthour One guide published by NIST specifically recommends avoiding kWh to avoid possible confusion kW·h is like kW h preferred with SI standards but it is very rarely used in practice The US official fueleconomy window sticker for electric vehicles uses the abbreviation kWhrs Variations in capitalization are sometimes seen KWh KWH kwh etc these are inconsistent with International System of Units The notation kWh as a symbol for kilowatthour is not correct Conversions Further information Conversion of units of energy To convert a quantity measured in a unit in the left column to the units in the top row multiply by the factor in the cell where the row and column intersect Watthour multiples and billing units Further information Metric prefixes All the SI prefixes are commonly applied to the watthour a kilowatthour is 1000 W·h symbols kW·h kWh or kW h a megawatthour is 1 million W·h symbols MW·h MWh or MW h a milliwatthour is 11000 W·h symbols mW·h mWh or mW h and so on The kilowatthour is commonly used by electrical distribution providers for purposes of billing since the monthly energy consumption of a typical residential customer ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand kilowatthours Megawatthours MWh gigawatthours GWh and terawatthours TWh are often used for metering larger amounts of electrical energy to industrial customers and in power generation The terawatthour and petawatthour PWh units are large enough to conveniently express the annual electricity generation for whole countries Confusion of kilowatthours energy and kilowatts power The terms power and energy are frequently confused Power is defined as the rate of delivery of energy the work performed per unit time measured in units joules per second or watts To produce power over any period of time requires energy Either higher levels of power for a given period or longer periods of run time at a given power level require more energy An electrical load eg a lamp TVset electric motor has a rated size in watts This is its running power level which equates to the instantaneous rate at which energy must be generated and consumed to run the device The amount of energy that is consumed at that rate depends on how long the device is operated However its power requirements are constant while running The unit of energy for residential electrical billing kilowatthours integrates changing power levels in use at the residence over the past billing period which is nominally 720 hours for a 30day month thus showing cumulative electrical energy use for the month For another example when a light bulb with a power rating of 100 watts is turned on for one hour the energy used is 100 watthours W·h 01 kilowatthour or 360 kilojoules This same amount of energy would light a 40watt bulb for 25 hours or a 10watt lowenergy bulb for 10 hours A power station electricity output at any particular moment would be measured in multiples of watts but its annual energy sales would be in multiples of watthours A kilowatthour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour or 36 megajoules Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example a 100watt ie 01 kilowatt light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 W⋅h or 08 kW⋅h If the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatthour it would cost 01 kW × 8 h × 025kW⋅h 020 Whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatthours consumed commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time such as 15 minutes This compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power These charges are billed as demand charges Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatthours TW⋅h for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year One terawatthour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year Misuse of watts per hour Power units measure the rate of energy per unit time Many compound units for rates explicitly mention units of time for example miles per hour kilometers per hour dollars per hour Kilowatthours are a product of power and time not a rate of change of power with time Watts per hour Wh is a unit of a change of power per hour It might be used to characterize the rampup behavior of power plants For example a power plant that reaches a power output of 1 MW from 0 MW in 15 minutes has a rampup rate of 4 MWh Hydroelectric power plants have a very high rampup rate which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations The proper use of terms such as watts per hour is uncommon whereas misuse may be widespread Other energyrelated units Several other units are commonly used to indicate power or energy capacity or use in specific application areas Average annual power production or consumption can be expressed in kilowatthours per year for example when comparing the energy efficiency of household appliances whose power consumption varies with time or the season of the year or the energy produced by a distributed power source One kilowatthour per year equals about 11408 milliwatts applied constantly during one year The energy content of a battery is usually expressed indirectly by its capacity in amperehours to convert watthours W·h to ampere hour A·h the watthour value must be divided by the voltage of the power source This value is approximate since the voltage is not constant during discharge of a battery and because higher discharge rates reduce the total amount of energy the battery can provide In the case of devices that output a different voltage than the battery it is the battery voltage typically 37 for Liion that must be used to calculate rather than the device output usually 50 for USB portable chargers since use of the lower figure allows manufacturers of such devices to overstate the capacity or runtime inflating it by 35  ⁄37135 This results in a 500mA USB device running for only about 37 hours on a 2500mAh battery rather than the expected five hours The Board of Trade unit BOTU is an obsolete UK synonym for kilowatthour The term derives from the name of the Board of Trade which regulated the electricity industry until 1942 when the Ministry of Power took over The BOTU should not be confused with the British thermal unit or BTU which is a much smaller quantity of thermal energy In India the kilowatthour is often simply called a Unit of energy A million units designated MU is a gigawatthour and a BU billion units is a terawatthour Burnup of nuclear fuel is normally quoted in megawatt days per tonne MW·dMTU where tonne refers to a metric ton of uranium metal or its equivalent and megawatt refers to the entire thermal output not the fraction which is converted to electricity See also Energy portal Amperehour Watt Joule Orders of magnitude energy Electric energy consumption Watt second
