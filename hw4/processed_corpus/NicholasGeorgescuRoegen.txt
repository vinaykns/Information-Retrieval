 Nicholas GeorgescuRoegen born Nicolae Georgescu 4 February 1906 – 30 October 1994 was a Romanian American mathematician statistician and economist He is best known today for his pathbreaking 1971 magnum opus The Entropy Law and the Economic Process where he argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity A progenitor and a paradigm founder in economics GeorgescuRoegens work was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics Several economists have hailed GeorgescuRoegen as a man who lived well ahead of his time and his magnum opus was appreciated by one of his closest peers as a landmark in economics Historians of economic thought have proudly proclaimed that the mans work has heralded a conceptual overturn in economics and that the man himself was the most able and imaginative economist of the 20th century In spite of candid admiration such as this GeorgescuRoegen was never awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics although benefactors from his native Romania actively lobbied for this After GeorgescuRoegens death his work was praised by a surviving friend of the highest rank Prominent Keynesian economist standard economics textbook author and Nobel Prize laureate Paul Samuelson professed in a foreword that he would be delighted if the fame GeorgescuRoegen did not fully realise in his own lifetime would be granted by posterity instead In the history of economic thought GeorgescuRoegen was the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of Earths mineral resources will eventually be exhausted at some point In his magnum opus GeorgescuRoegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is Earths capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earths finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use and consequently that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse leading to the demise of human civilisation itself Due to the radical pessimism inherent in his work based on the physical concept of entropy the theoretical position of GeorgescuRoegen and his followers was later termed entropy pessimism As he brought natural resource flows into economic modelling and analysis GeorgescuRoegens work was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics in the 1980s In addition the degrowth movement that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s recognises GeorgescuRoegen as the main intellectual figure influencing the movement Taken together by the 2010s GeorgescuRoegen has educated influenced and inspired at least three generations of people including his own contemporary economists younger ecological economists still younger degrowth organisers and activists and others around the world Through the 1980s GeorgescuRoegens work was popularised and promoted by trendspotter and political advisor Jeremy Rifkin who authored the controversial and widely publicised book entitled Entropy A New World View The inability or reluctance of most mainstream economists to recognise GeorgescuRoegens work has been ascribed to the fact that much of his work reads like applied physics rather than economics as this latter subject is generally taught and understood today GeorgescuRoegens work was blemished somewhat by mistakes caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics These mistakes have since generated some controversy involving both physicists and ecological economists Early in his life GeorgescuRoegen was the student and mentee of Joseph Schumpeter who taught that irreversible evolutionary change and creative destruction are inherent in capitalism Later in his life GeorgescuRoegen was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly who since went on to develop the concept of a steadystate economy to impose permanent government restrictions on the flow of natural resources through the world economy In 2012 two awards in honour of GeorgescuRoegens life and work were established by The Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi India The GeorgescuRoegen Annual Awards Japanese ecological economist Kozo Mayumi a student of GeorgescuRoegen in the 1980s was the first scholar to receive the award in the unconventional thinking category Life and career The life of Nicholas GeorgescuRoegen born Nicolae Georgescu spanned most of the 20th century from 1906 to 1994 In his native Romania he lived through two world wars and three dictatorships before he fled the country Living in political exile in the US in the second part of his life he witnessed at a distance the rise and fall of socialism in Romania He made many important contributions to mainstream neoclassical economics before he finally turned against it and published his paradigmatic magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process Although this opus was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics GeorgescuRoegen died disappointed and bitter that his paradigmatic work did not receive the appreciation he had expected for it in his own lifetime Childhood adolescence and education Nicolae Georgescu was born in Constanţa Romania in 1906 in a family of simple origins His father of Greek descent was an army officer His mother an ethnic Romanian was a sewing teacher at a girls school The father spent time teaching his son how to read write and calculate and planted in the boy the seed of intellectual curiosity By her living example the mother taught her son the value of hard work After having lost his position in the army for disciplinary reasons the father died when Nicolae was only eight years old Constanţa was then a small Black Sea port with some 25000 inhabitants and the mixture of various cultures and ethnic groups in the town shaped Nicolaes cosmopolitan spirit from his earliest years In primary school young Nicolae excelled at mathematics and he was encouraged by one of his teachers to apply for a scholarship at a secondary school the Lyceum Mânăstirea Dealu Lycée of the Monastery of the Hill a new prestigious military prep school in the town Nicolae won a scholarship there in 1916 but his attendance was delayed by Romanias entry into World War I His widowed mother fled with the family to Bucharest the countrys capital where they stayed with Nicolaes maternal grandmother during the rest of the war In these times of hardship Nicolae had traumatic boyhood experiences of the agonies of war He wanted to become a mathematics teacher but he could barely keep up his schoolwork After the war young Nicolae returned to his home town and started attending the lyceum Teaching standards were high and many of the teachers later went on to become university professors but the discipline was regimented with mockmilitary physical exercises and wearing uniforms Students were not permitted to leave the school at all except in summer and briefly during Christmas and Easter Nicolae proved to be an excellent student especially in mathematics He later credited the five years of secondary education he received at the lyceum for providing him with an extraordinary education that would serve him well later on in his career but he also blamed the discipline and the monastic isolation of the place for having stunted his social abilities something that would put him at odds with acquaintances and colleagues throughout his life At the lyceum it turned out that Nicolae Georgescu had a namesake In order to avoid any confusion he decided to create an addendum to his second name made up of the first and the last letter of his first name plus the first four letters of his last name all six letters put in the reverse order NicolaE GEORgescu → Roegen GeorgescuRoegen would retain this addendum for the rest of his life Later in his life he also changed his first name to its French and English form Nicholas Editors note For improved readability of the text and better use of space Nicholas GeorgescuRoegen will be referred to simply as Georgescu in the remainder of the present article Georgescu received his diploma from the lyceum in 1923 Thanks to a scholarship awarded to children from poor families he was soon after accepted at the University of Bucharest for further studies in mathematics The curriculum there was conventional and the teaching methods were much the same as those that had prevailed at the lyceum At the university he met the woman who would later become his wife for the rest of his life Otilia Busuioc To sustain himself during his studies he gave private lessons and taught in a grammar school outside the city After his graduation cum laude in 1926 he took the examination to qualify as a secondary school teacher and then accepted a teaching post for another year in his former lyceum in Constanţa At the university Georgescu had made a closer acquaintance with one of his professors Traian Lalescu a renowned mathematician of the day who had taken a special interest in applying mathematical methods to economic reality by means of statistics Lalescu was concerned with the lack of adequate data needed to analyse Romanias economic problems so he encouraged Georgescu to pursue this new line of research in further studies abroad Georgescu soon followed this piece of advice In 1927 he went to France to study at the Institute de Statistique Sorbonne in Paris Studying in Paris and London Georgescus stay in Paris broadened his field of study well beyond pure mathematics Not only did he attend the lectures of the best statistics and economics professors in France he also immersed himself in the philosophy of science especially the works of Blaise Pascal Ernst Mach and Henri Bergson Outside of the study chamber life was not easy for a poor foreign student in a great city The meager means he received from Romania could hardly support even his most basic necessities and the native French students habitually referred to all foreign students by the derogatory term métèques strangers But the studying progressed splendidly In 1930 Georgescu defended his doctoral dissertation on how to discover the cyclical components of a phenomenon with extraordinary honour Émile Borel one of Georgescus professors thought so highly of the dissertation that he had it published in full as a special issue of a French academic journal While studying in Paris Georgescu learned of the work of Karl Pearson at the University College in London Pearson was a leading English scholar of the time with a field of interests that coincided with Georgescus own namely mathematics statistics and philosophy of science Georgescu made arrangements to lodge with the family of a young Englishman he had met in Paris and left for England in 1931 During his stay in London the hosting family not only accepted Georgescu as their paying guest they also taught him the basics of the English language preparing him for his studies in the country When he approached Pearson and the English university system Georgescu was amazed with the informality and openness he found There was no more feeling like a métèque a stranger Studying with Pearson for the next two years and reading Pearsons work on the philosophy of science titled The Grammar of Science further shaped Georgescus scientific methodology and philosophy The two men even made a friendship and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics They copioneered research on the socalled problem of moments one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time but neither of them were able to solve the problem This was a great disappointment to Pearson but Georgescu was pleased about experiencing their joint effort nonetheless While studying in London Georgescu was contacted by a representative of the USbased Rockefeller Foundation Due to his past academic achievements the Foundation wanted to grant Georgescu a research fellowship in their country Georgescu had earlier learned of the use of time series analyses by the then famous Harvard Economic Barometer at the prestigious Harvard University so he accepted the grant The trip was put off for about a year however as he had more pressing obligations in Romania He needed to conclude his first national editorial project a 500 pages long manual on Metoda Statistică and he had to pay some attention to his old widowed mother who was in a bad state of health Trip to the United States meeting Schumpeter See also Harvard University In autumn 1934 Georgescu went to the New World but upon arriving at Harvard University he learned that the Economic Barometer had been shut down years before The project had completely failed to predict the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and was soon abandoned altogether After several failed attempts to find another sponsor for his research Georgescu finally managed to set up a meeting with the professor at the university teaching business cycles to see if there were any other opportunities available for him This professor happened to be Joseph Schumpeter Meeting Schumpeter at this point completely changed the direction of Georgescus life and career Schumpeter warmly welcomed Georgescu to Harvard and soon introduced him to the now famous circle one of the most remarkable groups of economists ever working at the same institution including Wassily Leontief Oskar Lange Fritz Machlup and Nicholas Kaldor among others Georgescu was now situated in a stimulating intellectual environment with weekly evening gatherings and informal academic discussions where Schumpeter himself presided as the ringmaster of the circle In Schumpeter Georgescu had found a competent and sympathetic mentor Although Georgescu never formally enrolled in any economics classes this was how he became an economist Schumpeter turned me into an economist My only degree in economics is from Universitas Schumpeteriana While at Harvard Georgescu published four important papers laying the foundations for his later theories of production and of consumer preferences The scholarly quality of these articles impressed Schumpeter There was more to the US than merely Harvard University even for Georgescu He managed to obtain a modest stipend for himself and his wife Otilia that enabled them to travel about the country journeying as far as California Through Schumpeters contacts Georgescu also got the opportunity of meeting Irving Fisher Harold Hotelling and other leading economists of the day To top it all he met Albert Einstein at Princeton University During the stay Georgescus relationship with Schumpeter developed As he realised that Georgescu was a promising young scholar Schumpeter wanted to keep him at Harvard He offered Georgescu a position with the economics faculty and asked him to work with him on an economics treatise as a joint effort just the two of them but Georgescu declined He wanted to go back to Romania in order to serve his backward fatherland that had sponsored most of his education already besides his return was expected at home Later in his life Georgescu would regret having turned down Schumpeters generous offer at this point in his career In spring 1936 Georgescu left the US His voyage back to Romania came to last almost a year in itself as he paid a long visit to Friedrich Hayek and John Hicks at the London School of Economics on the way home He was in no hurry to return The Romanian exile and the flight from there See also Romania in World War II Soviet occupation of Romania and Socialist Republic of Romania From 1937 to 1948 Georgescu lived in Romania witnessing all the turmoils and excesses of World War II and the subsequent rise to power of the communists in the country During the war Georgescu lost his only brother due to the fatal reaction to a vaccine against tuberculosis Upon his return from the US to the capital of Bucharest Georgescu was soon appointed to several government posts His doctoral dissertation from Sorbonne as well as his other academic credentials earned him a respectable reputation everywhere and his fine French and English skills were needed in the foreign affairs department He became vicedirector of the Central Statistical Institute responsible for compiling data on the countrys foreign trade on a daily basis he also served on the National Board of Trade settling commercial agreements with the major foreign powers he even participated in the diplomatic negotiations concerning the reassignment of Romanias national borders with Hungary Georgescu engaged himself in politics and joined the promonarchy National Peasants Party The countrys economy was still underdeveloped and had a large agrarian base where the mass of the peasantry lived in backwardness and poverty Substantial land reforms were called for if the most appalling inequalities between the rural and the urban parts of the population were to be evened out Georgescu put a persuasive effort into this work and was soon elevated to the higher ranks of the party becoming member of the partys National Council Georgescu did only little academic work during this period of his life Apart from coediting the national encyclopedia the Enciclopedia României and reporting on the countrys economic situation in some minor statistics publications he published nothing of scholarly significance Although he did reside in his native country Georgescu would later refer to this period of his life as his Romanian exile The exile was an intellectual one for him By the end of the war Romania was occupied by the Soviet Union A trusted government official and a leading member of an influential political party Georgescu was appointed general secretary of the Armistice Commission responsible for negotiating the conditions for peace with the occupying power The negotiations dragged out for half a year and came to involve long and stressful discussions During most of the war Romania had been an Axis power allied with Nazi Germany so the Soviet representatives treated the Commission as nothing but a vehicle for levying the largest possible amount of war reparations on the Romanian people After the war the political forces in the country began encroaching on Georgescu Before and during the war Romania had already passed through three successive dictatorships and the fourth one was now at hand Plenty of items on Georgescus track record were suitable for antagonising both the native Romanian communists and the Soviet authorities that still occupied the country His top membership of the Peasants Party in open opposition to the Communist Party his chief negotiating position in the Armistice Commission defending Romanias sovereignty against the occupying power and his earlier affiliation with capitalist US as a Rockefeller research fellow at Harvard University Political repression in the country intensified as the rise to power of the communists was completing and Georgescu finally realised it was time to get away I had to flee Romania before I was thrown into a jail from which no one has ever come out alive By the aid of the Jewish community — he had earlier risked his neck by helping the Jews during the Romanian part of the Holocaust — Georgescu and his wife got hold of counterfeit identity cards that secured them the passage out of the country surrounded by bribed smugglers and stowed away in the hold of a freight ship heading for Turkey Having visited Turkey before on official business Georgescu was able to use his contacts there to notify Schumpeter and Leontief at Harvard University in the US about his flight Leontief offered Georgescu a position at Harvard and made the necessary arrangements for the couple in advance of their arrival there Settling in the United States years at Vanderbilt University After an exhausting journey from Turkey through wartorn continental Europe Georgescu and his wife reached Cherbourg in France from where they crossed the Atlantic by ship Georgescus arrival at Harvard in summer 1948 was something of a return for him there Only now the circumstances were very different from what they had been in the 1930s He was no longer a promising young scholar on a trip abroad supported and sponsored by his native country instead he was a middleaged political refugee who had fled a communist dictatorship behind the Iron Curtain but he was welcomed at Harvard just the same obtaining employment as a lecturer and research associate collaborating with Wassily Leontief on the Harvard Economic Research Project and other subjects This was not a permanent employment though While working at Harvard Georgescu was approached by Vanderbilt University who offered him a permanent academic chair as economics professor Georgescu accepted the offer and moved to Vanderbilt in Nashville Tennessee in 1949 It has been argued that Georgescus decision to move from Harvard to the permanence and stability of the less prestigious Vanderbilt was motivated by his precarious wartime experiences and his feeling of insecurity as a political refugee in his new country It has also been argued that Joseph Schumpeter had at this point lost most of his former influence that could have secured his once mentee Georgescu a permanent position at Harvard Schumpeter died in 1950 Georgescu remained at Vanderbilt until his retirement in 1976 at age 70 Except for short trips he would never leave Nashville again During his years at Vanderbilt University Georgescu pursued an impressive academic career He held numerous visiting appointments and research fellowships across the continents and served as editor of a range of academic journals including the Econometrica He received several academic honours including the distinguished Harvie Branscomb Award presented in 1967 by his employer Vanderbilt University In 1971 the very same year his magnum opus was published he was honoured as Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association In the early 1960s Georgescu had Herman Daly as his student and mentee Daly later went on to become a leading ecological economist as well as the economists professions most faithful persistent and influential proponent of the economics of Georgescu However Georgescu on his part would later turn critical of his students work see below The publication of Georgescus magnum opus in 1971 did not trigger any immediate debates in the mainstream of the economics profession and the only review in a leading mainstream journal warned the readers against the incorrect statements and philosophical generalisations made by the author but Georgescu did receive four favourable reviews from heterodox evolutionary economists Through the 1970s Georgescu had a shortlived cooperation with the Club of Rome Whereas Georgescus own magnum opus went largely unnoticed by mainstream neoclassical economists the report on The Limits to Growth published in 1972 by the Club of Rome created something of a stir in the economics profession In the heated controversies that followed the report Georgescu found himself largely on the same side as the Club and opposed to the mainstream economists Teaming up with a natural ally he approached the Club and became a member there Georgescus theoretical work came to influence the Club substantially One other important result of the cooperation was the publication of the pointed and polemical article on Energy and Economic Myths where Georgescu took issue with the mainstream economists and various other debaters This article found a large audience through the 1970s Later the cooperation with the Club waned Georgescu reproached the Club for not adopting a clear antigrowth political stance he was also sceptical of the Clubs elitist and technocratic fashion of attempting to monitor and guide global social reality by building numerous abstract computer simulations of the world economy and then publish all the findings to the general public In the early 1980s the parties finally split up In continental Europe Georgescu and his work gained influence from the 1970s When Georgescu delivered a lecture at the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1974 he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher Jacques Grinevald The ensuing cooperation and friendship between the two resulted in the French translation of a selection of Georgescus articles entitled Demain la décroissance Entropie – Écologie – Économie Tomorrow the Decline Entropy – Ecology – Economy published in 1979 Similar to his involvement with the Club of Rome see above Georgescus pointed and polemical article on Energy and Economic Myths came to play a crucial role in the dissemination of his views among the later followers of the degrowth movement In the 1980s Georgescu met and befriended Catalan agricultural economist and historian of economic thought Juan MartínezAlier who would soon after become a driving force in the formation of both the International Society for Ecological Economics and the degrowth movement Since the degrowth movement formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s leading French champion of the movement Serge Latouche has credited Georgescu for being a main theoretical source of degrowth Likewise Italian degrowth theorist Mauro Bonaiuti has considered Georgescus work to be one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective Apart from his involvement with the Club of Rome and a few European scholars Georgescu remained a solitary man throughout the years at Vanderbilt He rarely discussed his ongoing work with colleagues and students and he collaborated in very few joint projects during his career In addition several independent sources confirm the observation that Georgescus uncompromising personality and bad temper made him a rather unpleasant acquaintance to deal with His blunt and demanding behaviour tended to offend most people in academia and elsewhere thereby undermining his influence and standing On Georgescus formal retirement in 1976 a symposium in his honour was organised by three of his colleagues at Vanderbilt and the papers presented there were later published as an anthology No fewer than four Nobel Prize laureates were among the contributing economists but none of the colleagues from Georgescus department at Vanderbilt participated a fact that has been taken as evidence of his social and academic isolation at the place Retirement later years and death After Georgescus formal retirement from Vanderbilt in 1976 he continued to live and work as an emeritus in his home in Nashville until his death in 1994 Through these later years he wrote several articles and papers expanding on and developing his views He also corresponded extensively with his friends and former colleagues In 1988 Georgescu was invited to join the editorial board of the newly established academic journal Ecological Economics published by the International Society for Ecological Economics but although most of the people organising the journal and the society recognised and admired Georgescus work he turned down the invitation He regarded both the journal and the society as nothing but vehicles for promoting concepts like sustainable development and steadystate economics concepts he himself dismissed as misdirected and wrong see below both here and here Georgescu had more ambitious goals He wanted to overturn and replace the existing but flawed mainstream paradigm of neoclassical economics with his own bioeconomics see below to downscale degrow the economy as soon as possible see below and not merely be relegated to some arcane and insignificant — so he believed — economics subdiscipline such as ecological economics Georgescu lived long enough to survive the communist dictatorship in Romania he had fled earlier in his life see above He even received some late recognition from his fatherland In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent Romanian Revolution in 1989 Georgescu was elected to the Romanian Academy in Bucharest He was pleased about this election His last years were marked by seclusion and withdrawal from the world By now Georgescu was an old man Although he had a productive and successful academic career behind him he was disappointed that his work had not received the dissemination and recognition he had expected for it in his own lifetime He believed he had long been running against a current As he likened himself to one unlucky heretic and legendary martyr of science out of the Italian Renaissance Georgescu grumbled and exclaimed E pur si muove is ordinarily attributed to Galileo although those words were the last ones uttered by Giordano Bruno on the burning stake He came to realise that he had failed in his lifes work to warn the general public and change peoples minds about the looming mineral resource exhaustion he himself was very concerned about He finally grasped that philosophical pessimism may well be a stance favoured by a few solitary intellectuals like himself but such a stance is normally shunned like a taboo in the wider human culture A considered pessimist is looked upon as a bearer of bad news and is not welcomed ever he lamented Yet in spite of his deep disappointment and frustration he continued to write down and propagate his views as long as he was physically able to do so By the end his health deteriorated He was becoming rather deaf and complications caused by his diabetes rendered him unable to walk stairs In his final years he isolated himself completely He cut off all human contact even to those of his former colleagues and students who appreciated his contribution to economics He died bitter and almost lonely in his home at the age of 88 His wife Otilia survived him by some four years The couple had no children In his obituary essay on Georgescu Herman Daly wrote admirably of his deceased teacher and mentor concluding that He demanded a lot but he gave more Work In his work as an economist Georgescu was influenced by the philosophy of Ernst Mach and the later school of logical positivism derived from Mach Georgescu found that two of his other main sources of inspiration namely Karl Pearson and Albert Einstein also had a largely Machian outlook My philosophy is in spirit Machian it is mainly concerned with the problem of valid analytical representations of the relations among facts Much of his criticism of both neoclassical economics and of Marxism was based on this outlook Coming to the US after World War II Georgescus background soon put him at odds with the dominant theoretical school of neoclassical economics in the country Having lived in Romania an underdeveloped and peasantdominated economy he realised that neoclassical economics could explain only those social conditions that prevailed in advanced capitalist economies but not in other institutional settings He was also critical of the increasing use of abstract algebraic formalism grounded in no facts of social reality Both of these issues made him attentive to social phenomena that were either overlooked or misrepresented by mainstream neoclassical economic analysis It has been argued that an unbroken path runs from Georgescus work in pure theory in the early years through his writings on peasant economies in the 1960s leading to his preoccupation with entropy and bioeconomics in the last 25 years of his life Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process According to Georgescus own recollection the ideas presented in his magnum opus were worked out in his mind over a period of twenty years or so before the final publication The three most important sources of inspiration for his work were Émile Borels monograph on thermodynamics he had read while studying in Paris see above Joseph Schumpeters view that irreversible evolutionary change are inherent in capitalism and the Romanian historical record of the large oil refineries in Ploieşti becoming target of strategic military attacks in both world wars proving the importance of natural resources in social conflict The shortcomings of both neoclassical economics and of Marxism Georgescu outlines that both main streams of economic thought having dominated the world since the end of the 19th century — namely neoclassical economics and Marxism — share the shortcoming of not taking into account the importance of natural resources in mans economy Hence Georgescu engages himself in an intellectual battle with two fronts The relevance of thermodynamics to economics See also Thermodynamics and Heat death of the universe The physical theory of thermodynamics is based on two laws The first law states that energy is neither created nor destroyed in any isolated system a conservation principle The second law of thermodynamics — also known as the entropy law — states that energy tends to be degraded to ever poorer qualities a degradation principle Georgescu argues that the relevance of thermodynamics to economics stems from the physical fact that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy only transform it The usual economic terms of production and consumption are mere verbal conventions that tend to obscure that nothing is created and nothing is destroyed in the economic process — things are only being transformed The science of thermodynamics features a cosmology of its own predicting the heat death of the universe Any transformation of energy — whether in nature or in human society — is moving the universe closer towards a final state of inert physical uniformity and maximum entropy According to this cosmological perspective all of mans economic activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary heat death locally on Earth Georgescu submits This view on the economy was later termed entropy pessimism Some of Georgescus followers and interpreters have elaborated on this view Conceptions of scarcity See also Human overpopulation Introducing the term low entropy for valuable natural resources and the term high entropy for valueless waste and pollution Georgescu explains that all the economic process does from a physical point of view is to irreversibly transform low entropy into high entropy thereby providing a flow of natural resources for people to live on The irreversibility of this economic process is the reason why natural resources are scarce Recycling of material resources is possible but only by using up some energy resources plus an additional amount of other material resources and energy resources in turn cannot be recycled at all but are dissipated as waste heat according to the entropy law Georgescu points out that Earth is a closed system in the thermodynamic sense of the term Earth exchanges energy but not matter practically with the rest of the universe Hence mainly two sources of low entropy are available to man namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the Earth and the flow of radiation received from the Sun Since the Sun will continue to shine for billions of years to come the Earths mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the crust of the Earth at a rate of our own choosing practically the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the Earth at a constant and fixed rate beyond human control This natural asymmetry between mans access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life The busy urban life on the one hand is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals the tranquil rural life on the other hand is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy Georgescu points out that this asymmetry helps explaining the historical subjection of the countryside by the town since the dawn of civilisation and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this subjection properly into account in his theory of historical materialism Georgescu explains that modern mechanised agriculture has developed historically as a result of the growing pressure of population on arable land but the relief of this pressure by means of mechanisation has only substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation Machinery chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earths mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been Georgescu cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of Earth is decreasing In effect overpopulation on Earth is largely a dynamic long run phenomenon being a byproduct of ever more constraining mineral scarcities The flowfund model of production See also Production function and Input–output model Georgescus model of the economy grew out of his dissatisfaction with neoclassical production theory as well as the inputoutput model of the economy developed by Nobel Prize laureate Wassily Leontief Georgescu realised that production cannot be adequately described by stocks of equipment and inventories only or by flows of inputs and outputs only It was necessary to combine these two descriptions In order to complete the picture it was also necessary to add the new concept of a fund In Georgescus flowfund model of production a fund factor is either labour power farm land or manmade capital providing a useful service at any point in time a stock factor is a material or energy input that can be decumulated at will and a flow factor is a stock spread out over a period of time The fund factors constitute the agents of the economic process and the flow factors are used or acted upon by these agents Unlike a stock factor a fund factor cannot be utilised decumulated at will as its rate of utilisation depends on the distinct physical properties of the fund labour power and farm land for instance may run the risk of overutilisation and exhaustion if proper care is not taken Contrary to neoclassical production theory Georgescu identifies nature as the exclusive primary source of all factors of production According to the first law of thermodynamics matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy the conservation principle According to the second law of thermodynamics — the entropy law — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes to states unavailable for human purposes the degradation principle This transformation constitutes a unidirectional and irreversible process Consequently valuable natural resources low entropy are procured by the input end of the economy the resources flow through the economy being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way and unvaluable waste and pollution high entropy eventually accumulate by the output end Mankind lives in by and of nature and we return our residues to nature By so doing the entropy of the combined natureeconomy system steadily increases The presence of natural resource flows in Georgescus model of production production function differentiates the model from those of both Keynesian macroeconomics neoclassical economics as well as classical economics including most — though not all — variants of Marxism Only in ecological economics are natural resource flows positively recognised as a valid theoretical basis for economic modelling and analysis Later Georgescus production model formed the basis of his criticism of neoclassical economics see below Mans economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind bioeconomics In his social theory Georgescu argues that mans economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of his biological struggle to sustain life and survive This biological struggle has prevailed since the dawn of man and the nature of the struggle was not altered by the invention of money as a medium of exchange Unlike the animals man has developed exosomatic instruments that is tools and equipment These instruments are produced by man and are not a part of his body At the same time production is a social and not an individual undertaking This situation has turned mans struggle to sustain life and survive into a social conflict which is unique when compared to the animals Contrasting his own view with those of Karl Marx Georgescu asserts When man some men attempts to radically change the distribution of access to material resources in society this may result in wars or revolutions Georgescu admits but even though wars and revolutions may bring about the intended redistributions mans economic struggle and the social conflict will remain There will be rulers and ruled in any social order and the ruling is largely a continuation of the biological struggle of sustaining life and survive Georgescu claims Under these material conditions the ruling classes of past and present have always resorted to force ideology and manipulation to defend their privileges and maintain the acquiescence of the ruled This historical fact does not end with communism Georgescu points out quite the opposite it goes on during communism and beyond it as well It would be contrary to mans biological nature to organise himself otherwise Later Georgescu introduced the term bioeconomics short for biological economics to describe his view that mans economic struggle is a continuation of the biological struggle In his final years he planned to write a book on the subject of bioeconomics but due to old age he was unable to complete it He did manage to write a sketch on it though Population pressure mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind See also Global catastrophic risk Human extinction and Pessimism § Philosophical pessimism Georgescu takes a dismal view on the future of mankind On the one hand his general argument is that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is Earths capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is decreasing as Earths finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use but on the other hand he finds that restraining ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the supposed benefit of unknown future generations is running counter to our biological nature as a species considered We cannot help ourselves Consequently the world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future From that point on ever deepening scarcities will cause widespread misery aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and intensify mans economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood A prolonged biological spasm of our species will follow ultimately spelling the end of mankind itself as man has now become completely and irreversibly dependent on the industrial economy for his biological existence We are not going to make it We are doomed to downfall destruction and demise Predicts Georgescu Georgescus radically pessimistic existential risk perspective on global mineral resource exhaustion was later countered by Robert Ayres see below Work after magnum opus In the years following the publication of his magnum opus in 1971 and until his death in 1994 Georgescu published a number of articles and essays where he further expanded on and developed his views Criticising neoclassical economics weak versus strong sustainability See also Ecological economics § Weak versus strong sustainability Market failure § Ecological and Sustainable development § Insubstantial stretching of the term Criticising neoclassical economics Georgescu argues that neoclassical production theory is false when representing the economy as a mechanical circular and closed system with no inlets and no outlets A misrepresentation such as this fails to take into account the exhaustion of mineral resources at the input end and the building up of waste and pollution at the output end In Georgescus view the economy is represented more accurately by his own flowfund model of production see above In addition Georgescu finds that neoclassical economics tends to overlook or at best to misrepresent the problem of how to distribute the exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations Georgescu points out that the market mechanisms of supply and demand are systematically unable to work out the intergenerational distribution problem in a satisfactory way since future generations are not and cannot be present on todays market This anomaly of the market mechanisms — or ecological market failure — is described by Georgescu as a dictatorship of the present over the future On this issue notable economists and Nobel Prize laureates Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz Georgescus two main adversaries in academia in the 1970s have stated their account of the mainstream neoclassical approach to the economics of exhaustible resources They both claim that across the board substitutability of manmade capital for natural capital constitutes a real possibility Hence any concern with intergenerational distribution of the mineral stock should be relaxed somewhat according to Solow or even ignored altogether according to Stiglitz The position of Solow and Stiglitz as well as other likeminded theorists in the neoclassical tradition was later termed weak sustainability by environmental economist Kerry Turner In response to the position of Solow and Stiglitz Georgescu argues that neoclassical economists generally fail to realise the important difference between material resources and energy resources in the economic process This is where his flowfund model of production comes into play see above Georgescus point is that only material resources can be transformed into manmade capital Energy resources on the other hand cannot be so transformed as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter and matter is what manmade capital is made up of physically The only possible role to be performed by energy resources is to assist — usually as fuel or electricity — in the process of transforming material resources into manmade capital In Georgescus own terminology energy may have the form of either a stock factor mineral deposits in nature or a flow factor resources transformed in the economy but never that of a fund factor manmade capital in the economy Hence substituting manmade capital for energy resources is physically impossible Furthermore not all material resources are transformed into manmade capital instead some material resources are manufactured directly into consumer goods with only limited durability Finally in the course of time all manmade capital depreciates wears out and needs replacement but both old and new manmade capital is made out of material resources to begin with All in all the economic process is indeed a process with steadily increasing entropy and the mechanical notion of across the board substitutability prevalent in neoclassical economics is untenable Georgescu submits Contrary to the neoclassical position Georgescu argues that flow factors and fund factors that is natural resources and manmade capital are essentially complementary since both are needed in the economic process in order to have a working economy Georgescus conclusion then is that the distribution of exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations is a large problem that cannot and should not be relaxed or ignored The position of Georgescu including his criticism of neoclassical economics was later termed strong sustainability by Kerry Turner Later still Turners taxonomy of weak and strong sustainability was integrated into ecological economics However contrary to the widely established use of Turners simplifying taxonomy Georgescu certainly did not term his own position strong sustainability or any other variant of sustainability Quite the opposite Georgescu flatly dismissed any notion of sustainable development as only so much snake oil intended to deceive the general public In his last years he even denounced the notion bitterly as one of the most toxic recipes for mankind There can be no such thing as a sustainable rate of extraction and use of a finite stock of nonrenewable mineral resources — any rate will diminish the remaining stock itself Consequently the Industrial Revolution has brought about an unsustainable economic development in the world see below Criticising Dalys steadystate economics See also Steadystate economy § Herman Dalys concept of a steadystate economy Leading ecological economist and steadystate theorist Herman Daly is a former student and mentee of Georgescu In the 1970s Daly developed the concept of a steadystate economy by which he understands an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth manmade capital and a constant stock of people population both stocks to be maintained by a minimal flow of natural resources or throughput as he terms it Daly argues that this steadystate economy is both necessary and desirable in order to keep human environmental impact within biophysical limits however defined and to create more distributional fairness between present and future generations with regard to mineral resource use In several articles Georgescu criticised his students concept of a steadystate economy Georgescu argues that Dalys steadystate economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind especially not in the longer run Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the Earth exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores In the course of time then extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase Eventually all minerals will be exhausted but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade hence continued extraction will no longer pay off and the market for these resources will then collapse This longterm dynamics works itself through any economic subsystem regardless of the systems geographical location its size and its state of development whether a progressive a steady or a declining state In effect the arguments advanced by Daly in support of his steadystate economy apply with even greater force in support of a decliningstate economy Georgescu points out When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is true but negative growth is better still In this context Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels manmade capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steadystate Instead of Dalys steadystate economics Georgescu proposed his own socalled minimal bioeconomic program featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by Daly Herman Daly on his part has readily accepted his teachers judgement on this subject matter In order to compensate for the principle of diminishing returns in mineral resource extraction an ever greater share of capital and labour in the economy will gradually have to be assigned to the mining sector thereby distorting the initial structure of any steadystate system Furthermore the steadystate economy will serve only to postpone and not to prevent the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion anyway A steadystate economy cannot last forever but neither can a growing economy nor a declining economy Daly concedes in his response to Georgescus criticism In the same turn Daly confirms Georgescus general argument that Earths carrying capacity is decreasing as mankind is extracting the finite mineral stock Likewise several other economists in the field besides Georgescu and Daly have agreed that a steadystate economy does not by itself constitute a longterm solution to the entropy problem facing mankind Technology assessments in historical perspective See also History of technology Energy returned on energy invested and Solar power In his technology assessments Georgescu puts thermodynamic principles to use in a wider historical context including the future of mankind According to Georgescus terminology a technology is viable only when it is able to return an energy surplus sufficiently large to maintain its own operation plus some additional energy left over for other use If this criterion is not met the technology in question is only feasible if workable at all but not viable Both viable and feasible technologies depend on a steady flow of natural resources for their operation Georgescu argues that the first viable technology in the history of man was fire By the control of fire it was possible for man to burn a forest or all forests It was also possible to cook food and to obtain warmth and protection Inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man Georgescu terms fire the first Promethean recipe According to Georgescu a later important Promethean recipe technology of the same first kind was animal husbandry feeding on grass and other biomass like fire does Much later in the history of man the steam engine came about as the crucial Promethean recipe of the second kind feeding on coal With the invention of the steam engine it was possible to drain the groundwater flooding the mine shafts and the mined coal could then be used as fuel for other steam engines in turn This technology propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the second half of the 18th century whereby mans economy has been thrust into a long nevertoreturn overshootandcollapse trajectory with regard to the Earths mineral stock Georgescu lists the internal combustion engine and the nuclear fission reactor as other later examples of Promethean recipes of the second kind namely heat engines feeding on a mineral fuel oil and uranium plus thorium respectively By a Promethean recipe of the third kind Georgescu understands a solar collector returning a net energy output sufficiently large to supply all the energy input needed to manufacture an additional solar collector of the same kind thereby constituting a full serial reproduction with regard to solar energy only The fact that solar collectors of various kinds had been in operation on a substantial scale for more than a century without providing a breakthrough in energy efficiency brought Georgescu to the conclusion that no Promethean recipe was yet around in the world in his day Only feasible recipes for solar collectors were available functioning like what he labelled parasites with regard to the terrestrial inputs of energy for their manufacture and operation — and like any other parasite these recipes cannot survive their host the host being the sources of the terrestrial inputs Georgescu believed that for a worldwide solarpowered economy to be truly energy selfsupporting a Promethean kind of solar collector had yet to be invented Later some scholars have argued that the efficiency of solar collectors has increased considerably since Georgescu made these assessments Georgescu further points out that regardless of the efficiency of any particular kind of solar collector the major drawback of solar power per se when compared to terrestrial fossil fuels and uranium plus thorium is the diffuse lowintensity property of solar radiation Hence a lot of material equipment is needed as inputs at the surface of the Earth to collect concentrate and when convenient store or transform the radiation before it can be put to use on a larger industrial scale This necessary material equipment adds to the parasitical operation of solar power Georgescu maintains Assessing fusion power as a possible future source of energy Georgescu ventured the opinion that regarding magnetic confinement fusion no reactor will ever be built to be large enough to effectively withstand and confine the vehement thermal pressure of the plasmic deuteriumtritium fusion processes through an extended period of time He did not assess the other one of the two major fusion power technologies being researched in his day — and still being researched — namely inertial confinement fusion All of these technology assessments have to do with energy resources only and not with material resources Georgescu stressed the point that even with the proliferation of solar collectors throughout the surface of the globe or the advent of fusion power or both any industrial economy will still depend on a steady flow of material resources extracted from the crust of the Earth notably metals He repeatedly argued his case that in the far future it will be scarcity of terrestrial material resources and not of energy resources that will prove to impose the most binding constraint on mans economy on Earth As he held no space advocacy views Georgescu failed to assess the still emerging technology of asteroid mining or any other known type of space colonisation as potentials for compensating for this future scarcity constraint facing mankind He was convinced that throughout its entire span of existence our species will remain confined solely to Earth for all practical purposes His paradigmatic vision concluded thereby Mistakes and controversies See also Laws of thermodynamics Recycling § Energy and material flows Mining § Metal reserves and recycling and Spaceship Earth Georgescus work was blemished somewhat by mistakes caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics While working on his magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process see above Georgescu had the firm understanding that the entropy law applies equally well to both energy resources and to material resources and much of the reasoning in the opus rests on this understanding But regrettably this understanding was — and still is — false In thermodynamics proper the entropy law does apply to energy but not to matter of macroscopic scale that is not to material resources Later when Georgescu realised his mistake his reaction passed through several stages of contemplation and refinement ultimately leading to his formulation of a new physical law namely the fourth law of thermodynamics This fourth law states that complete recycling of matter is impossible The purpose of Georgescus proposed fourth law was to substantiate his initial claim that not only energy resources but also material resources are subject to general and irreversible physical degradation when put to use in economic activity In addition he introduced the term material entropy to describe this physical degradation of material resources Georgescu himself was not confident about this tentative solution to the problem He remained embarrassed that he had misinterpreted and consequently overstretched the proper application of the physical law that formed part of the title of his magnum opus He conceded that he had entered into the science of thermodynamics as something of a bold novice Dedicated to interdisciplinarity he was worried that physicists would dismiss all of his work as amateurism on this count The predicament would trouble him for the rest of his life In one of his last published articles before his death Georgescu described his encouragement when he had once earlier come across the concept of matter dissipation used by German physicist and Nobel Prize laureate Max Planck to account for the existence of irreversible physical processes where no simultaneous transformation of energy was taking place Georgescu found comfort in the belief that the concept of matter dissipation used by a physicist of Plancks authoritative standing would decisively substantiate his own fourth law and his own concept of material entropy Georgescus formulation of a fourth law of thermodynamics and the concept of material entropy soon generated a prolonged controversy involving both physicists and ecological economists but some twelve to fifteen years after Georgescus death a consensus on this subject matter finally emerged along the following lines There is only one measure of entropy in thermodynamics and this one measure applies to both energy and to microscopic matter at the molecular level kinetic gas theory but the measure does not apply to macroscopic matter matter in bulk material resources though it frequently appears so in the ecological economics literature and elsewhere The general physical degradation of material resources taking place in the economy can neither be explained nor described by the entropy law Georgescus first mistake but the fact remains that such physical degradation does take place all the time — continuously irreversibly and in a variety of ways The fourth law of thermodynamics and the concept of material entropy as proposed by Georgescu to redress his first mistake have no scientific basis in physics whatsoever and it was a theoretical mistake by Georgescu to make these propositions at all Georgescus second mistake but by itself this does not imply that complete and perpetual recycling of material resources is possible as it may be impossible on other grounds see below Both of Georgescus mistakes were caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics It is bad physics and equally bad economics to devise a new physical law the fourth one in order to make up for ones own insufficient understanding of a physical theory in the first place Apart from these two mistakes Georgescus work is still compliant with the first and second law of thermodynamics as already established in physics In the same vein as this consensus a full chapter on the economics of Georgescu has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics and the details Georgescus mistakes about the fourth law and material entropy are omitted there Modelling a possible future economic system for mankind Robert Ayres has countered Georgescus position on the impossibility of complete and perpetual recycling of material resources According to Ayres it is possible to develop what he conceptualises as a spaceship economy on Earth on a stable and permanent basis provided that a sufficient flow of energy is available to support it for example by an ample supply of solar energy In this spaceship economy all waste materials will be temporarily discarded and stored in inactive reservoirs — or what he calls waste baskets — before being recycled and returned to active use in the economic system at some later point in time It will not be necessary or even possible for materials recycling to form its own separate and continuous flow to be of use — only the waste baskets in question have to be large enough to compensate for the rate and the efficiency of the recycling effort In effect complete and perpetual recycling of material resources will be possible in a future spaceship economy of this kind specified thereby rendering obsolete Georgescus proposed fourth law of thermodynamics Ayres submits In a later article Ayres restated his case for a spaceship economy In ecological economics Ayres contribution visàvis Georgescus proposed fourth law was since described as yet another instance of the socalled energetic dogma Earlier Georgescu had attached the label energetic dogma to various theorists holding the view that only energy resources and not material resources are the constraining factor in all economic activity Ayres appears to be the odd man out on this subject matter Whatever the scientific status of Georgescus fourth law may be several other economists in the field besides Georgescu deny the possibility of complete and perpetual recycling of all material resources in any type of economic system regardless of the amount of energy time and information to be assigned to the recycling effort Prizes and awards The GeorgescuRoegen Prize Each year since 1987 the GeorgescuRoegen Prize has been awarded by the Southern Economic Association for the best academic article published in the Southern Economic Journal The GeorgescuRoegen Annual Awards In 2012 two awards in honour of Georgescus life and work were established by The Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi India The GeorgescuRoegen Annual Awards The awards were officially announced on Georgescus 106th birth anniversary The awards have two categories The award for unconventional thinking is presented for scholarly work in academia and the award for bioeconomic practice is presented for initiatives in politics business and grassroot organisations Japanese ecological economist Kozo Mayumi a student of Georgescu in 198488 was the first to receive the award in the unconventional thinking category Mayumi was awarded for his work on energy analysis and hierarchy theory Famous quotes Bigger and better motorcycles automobiles jet planes refrigerators etc necessarily cause not only bigger and better depletion of natural resources but also bigger and better pollution William Petty was right in teaching that Nature is the mother and labour is the father of all wealth — only he should have said of our existence One thought has persisted in my mind ever since I became interested in the entropic nature of the economic process Will mankind listen to any program that implies a constriction of its addiction to exosomatic comfort Perhaps the destiny of man is to have a short but fiery exciting and extravagant life rather than a long uneventful and vegetative existence Let other species — the amoebas for example — which have no social ambitions whatever inherit an Earth still bathed in plenty of sunshine See also Romania portal Biography portal Business and economics portal Ecology
