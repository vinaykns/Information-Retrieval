 By year end 2015 Spain was the worlds fifth biggest producer of wind power with 23031 MW installed capacity including 11 MW of windhydro capacity providing 48118 GWh of power and 19 of the countrys total electricity production in that year In 2014 a record breaking year for renewable electricity production wind power accounted for 202 of total electricity generation in Spain making it the second most important electricity source after nuclear power 22 and ahead of coal power 165 In earlier periods wind energy covered 16 of the demand in 2010 138 in 2009 and 115 in 2008 Following the fallout from the financial crisis in 2008 and the dire straits of the Spanish economy in the subsequent period new installations of new wind turbines all but stagnated between 2012 and 2015 remaining at close to 23000 MW installed capacity for the entire period Whilst Spain put expansion on ice the other world leading countries continued to expand or accelerated new wind turbine installations and by 2015 India had moved ahead of Spain in total installations As of end 2015 the countries when ranked by total installations were 1 China 2 Usa 3 Germany 4 India 5 Spain and 6 United Kingdom On windy days wind power generation has surpassed all other electricity sources in Spain On 21 November 2015 at 450 am 704 of the electricity consumed on the Spanish Peninsula was covered with wind power energy On 6 February 2013 wind power achieved an earlier record in electricity production reaching an instantaneous peak of 17056 MW and an hourly production of 16918 MWh In November 2011 a capacity peak of 59 of power demand being generated by wind power was reached Power peaks of 14960 GW were reached in November 2010 and in November 2009 a wind storm caused wind farms to produce a peak of 53 of total electricity demand 11546 GW In 2009 the largest producer of wind power in Spain was Iberdrola with 255 of capacity followed by Acciona with 209 and NEO Energia EDP Renewables with 83 Growth in installed capacity and generation Regional trends A 2006 article stated that the intended wind energy capacity to be installed in the autonomous regions by 20102011 at 20000 MW Navarra The US rating agency Standard Poors in a 2006 investigation of standard of living in Europe ranked Navarre whose primary source of renewable energy was wind power uppermost among the 17 autonomous regions of Spain At that time Navarre sustained approximately 70 percent of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources wind farms being used most extensively and had a 900megawatt capacity of installed wind power Navarre lacks thermal nuclear coal oil gas fields or hefty hydroelectric power stations but does possess considerable wind renewable resources which the Government of Navarre pursued to drop its external energy dependence Navarre was entirely reliant on imported energy until windpower development and utilization began progress in 1996 Galicia In 2007 Galicia lead Spain in wind power development amongst the autonomous regions for the third consecutive year with an increase in wind power of 264 MW succeeding Castilla La Mancha which exceeded its development goal of 1000MW Castile and León Aaragon and Navarre and the remaining autonomous regions Research Largely concerned with advancing energy efficiency use in Spain the Institute for Energy Saving and Diversification IDAE also seeks to expand renewable energy sources and energies Research concerning the production of hydrogen from electrolysis of water by a wind farm began in 2004 at a newly installed laboratory in the Universidad Pública de Navarra under an agreement between Energía Hidroeléctrica de Navarra Stuart Energy Systems of Canada and Statkraft of Norway The lab replicated the power generation environment of a wind farm and examined the effects of an electrolyzer Concentrated research is occurring concerning wind measurement in the Albacete region at Higueruela Wind power industry A 2005 report showed the Spanish wind energy sector hosting the involvement of over 500 companies with approximately 150 wind turbine production plants and their machinery across the Spanish regions The assets of the Spanish industry were noticed and acted upon by financial analysts as United States Ernst and Young in 2005 ranked the wind market in Spain among the uppermost in its index of longterm country attractiveness Including those indirectly employed in supplying components and services the total number of jobs supported by Spain’s wind industry had reached more than 30 000 and was estimated to double to 60 000 by 2010 2005 Gamesa Eólica Main article Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica Gamesa based in the Basque Country is a large global wind turbine manufacturer with 13 share by installed power in 2005 The company values the distinctive geographical setting of Spain as a benefit to Spanish companies competing in the global arena Gamesa Eólica currently operates plants in Spain The US and China It has projects in many other parts of the world including Egypt Germany Ireland Italy Japan Korea and Portugal Gamesa opened a manufacturing plant for wind turbine generator blades in Philadelphia Pennsylvania in 2005 creating 500 parttime building and operations jobs and 236 permanent manufacturing jobs the building operation and upkeep of Gamesa’s wind farms in conjunction with its two Philadelphia offices and production plant formed about 1000 jobs in the state over a fiveyear period The company seeks expansion into Greece Taiwan and the United Kingdom Ecotècnia Alstom Wind Main article Alstom Ecotècnia Ecotècnia established 1981 and by 2005 had 21 world market share by installed capacity with wind turbines in production of up to 16MW In 2009 the company was acquired by Alstom for €350million The company continued to develop wind turbines a 3MW machine was installed in a commercial windfarm in 2009 In 2010 the company was renamed Alstom Wind In 20112 the company developed a prototype 6MW permanent magnet gearless generator for offshore applications in association with LM Wind Power and Converteam Acciona Energy Main article Acciona Energy Acciona Energy Acciona Energía the biggest global windpark developer at the time operated in Australia Canada France Germany Morocco Spain and the United States The company credited its success to its initial stages in Navarre during 1994 Its line of work involved windfarm operation turbine manufacture and the development of windpower plants and the company intended to expand into China Ireland and the United Kingdom Iberdrola Main article Iberdrola Iberdrola held functioning facilities in Brazil France Greece Italy Mexico Portugal Spain the United States and the United Kingdom and continued to develop wind farms in Europe and Latin America2 As of 2008 Iberdrola plans to develop six offshore wind farm projects with a combined generation capacity of 3000 MW at locations off the coasts of the Spanish Atlantic provinces of Cadiz Huelva and the Mediterranean province of Castellon MTorres MTorres initiated their activities in the Wing Energy field in 1998 with the launch of their newly developed Wind Turbine TWT1570 a 1500 KW variablespeed directdrive multipole Wind Turbine with a fullpower converter and a 70 meters rotor diameter Exports The national Spanish wind energy industry began exporting its wind generators by forming contracts for the erection of wind farms in China India and Mexico as well as Cuba where work began in 1998 2007 They also had contracts at a highly developed stage with Portugal Turkey Tunisia Egypt Brazil and Argentina The wind energy capacity for major companies in Spain was the following as of 2007 Gamesa Eólica 3281 MW Made 803 MW Neg Micon 715 MW Ecotècnia 446 MW G Electric 343 MW IzarBonus 317 MW Desa AWP 121 MW Enercon 58 MW Lagerwey 38 MW and Others 113 MW 2007 Future development Three factors will control the further progress of wind power development in Spain the capability of the wind farms network to hold all the electricity harnessed by wind power predominantly in offpeak times the cost of energy and the environmental effect that the abundance of wind farm development in Spain could turn out The Spanish wind power industry will be confronted with the following issues in the immediate future formulating its development to be congruent with required supply agreements by the national electricity supply operator guaranteeing that the installation of wind farms occurs with recognition of the environment synchronizing wind power development of the 17 autonomous regions trimming down the investment costs to acquire sufficient returns with declining energy prices in the upcoming years It is also noteworthy that the supportive Spanish policies for wind power development have resulted in severe competition for construction sites among major companies Political leaders in the autonomous communities have been frazzled by the numerous applications for wind farm construction Local possession of wind power is not present in Spain but does not appear to take away from further development of wind power in Spain since a much smaller and weaker quantity of local antiwind farm grid population inhabits the country However a further obstacle concerning wind power development needs to be tackled before Spain can achieve these ambitious objectives construction of a central control center for all the Spanish wind farms analogous to the control center used for traditional power plants Opposition With some exceptions there has been little opposition to the installation of inland wind parks However the projects to build offshore parks have been more controversial According to Cohn et al The proposal of building the biggest offshore wind power production facility in the world in southwestern Spain on the spot of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar has been met with strong oppostition from the towns in the coast of Cádiz who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area There have also been complaints by the British who claim that the area is a war grave and that any development of the area could destroy archaeological evidence of the historic battle See also Renewable energy portal Spain portal Renewable energy in Spain Solar power in Spain Renewable energy by country Wind power in the European Union Renewable
