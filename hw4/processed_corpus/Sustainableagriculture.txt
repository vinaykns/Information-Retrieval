 Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services the study of relationships between organisms and their environment It has been defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a sitespecific application that will last over the long term for example Satisfy human food and fiber needs Enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends Make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and onfarm resources and integrate where appropriate natural biological cycles and controls Sustain the economic viability of farm operations Enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole History of the term The phrase was reportedly coined by the Australian agricultural scientist Gordon McClymont Wes Jackson is credited with the first publication of the expression in his 1980 book New Roots for Agriculture The term became popularly used in the late 1980s Farming and natural resources Sustainable agriculture can be understood as an ecosystem approach to agriculture Practices that can cause longterm damage to soil include excessive tilling of the soil leading to erosion and irrigation without adequate drainage leading to salinization Longterm experiments have provided some of the best data on how various practices affect soil properties essential to sustainability In the United States a federal agency USDANatural Resources Conservation Service specializes in providing technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation and production agriculture as compatible goals The most important factors for an individual site are sun air soil nutrients and water Of the five water and soil quality and quantity are most amenable to human intervention through time and labor Although air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water When farmers grow and harvest crops they remove some of these nutrients from the soil Without replenishment land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced yields Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of nonrenewable resources such as natural gas used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertilizer or mineral ores eg phosphate Possible sources of nitrogen that would in principle be available indefinitely include recycling crop waste and livestock or treated human manure growing legume crops and forages such as peanuts or alfalfa that form symbioses with nitrogenfixing bacteria called rhizobia industrial production of nitrogen by the Haber process uses hydrogen which is currently derived from natural gas but this hydrogen could instead be made by electrolysis of water using electricity perhaps from solar cells or windmills or genetically engineering nonlegume crops to form nitrogenfixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts The last option was proposed in the 1970s but is only recently becoming feasible Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs phosphorus potassium etc are more limited More realistic and often overlooked options include longterm crop rotations returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands returning lost nutrients indefinitely such as the flooding of the Nile the longterm use of biochar and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests drought or lack of nutrients Crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner if certain fertilizer management practices are adhered to Nationwide food producers require vast amounts of land and soil to produce food at an accelerated rate This diminishes the nutrients in the soil and decimates the idea of sustainable agriculture which is best built through local regional agricultural methods Water In some areas sufficient rainfall is available for crop growth but many other areas require irrigation For irrigation systems to be sustainable they require proper management to avoid salinization and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable Otherwise the water source effectively becomes a nonrenewable resource Improvements in water well drilling technology and submersible pumps combined with the development of drip irrigation and lowpressure pivots have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable However this progress has come at a price In many areas such as the Ogallala Aquifer the water is being used faster than it can be replenished Several steps must be taken to develop droughtresistant farming systems even in normal years with average rainfall These measures include both policy and management actions improving water conservation and storage measures providing incentives for selection of droughttolerant crop species using reducedvolume irrigation systems managing crops to reduce water loss and not planting crops at all Indicators for sustainable water resource development are Internal renewable water resources This is the average annual flow of rivers and groundwater generated from endogenous precipitation after ensuring that there is no double counting It represents the maximum amount of water resource produced within the boundaries of a country This value which is expressed as an average on a yearly basis is invariant in time except in the case of proved climate change The indicator can be expressed in three different units in absolute terms km³yr in mmyr it is a measure of the humidity of the country and as a function of population m³person per year Global renewable water resources This is the sum of internal renewable water resources and incoming flow originating outside the country Unlike internal resources this value can vary with time if upstream development reduces water availability at the border Treaties ensuring a specific flow to be reserved from upstream to downstream countries may be taken into account in the computation of global water resources in both countries Dependency ratio This is the proportion of the global renewable water resources originating outside the country expressed in percentage It is an expression of the level to which the water resources of a country depend on neighbouring countries Water withdrawal In view of the limitations described above only gross water withdrawal can be computed systematically on a country basis as a measure of water use Absolute or perperson value of yearly water withdrawal gives a measure of the importance of water in the countrys economy When expressed in percentage of water resources it shows the degree of pressure on water resources A rough estimate shows that if water withdrawal exceeds a quarter of global renewable water resources of a country water can be considered a limiting factor to development and reciprocally the pressure on water resources can affect all sectors from agriculture to environment and fisheries Soil Soil erosion is fast becoming one of the worlds severe problems It is estimated that more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africas soil are eroded every year Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates Soil erosion is not unique to Africa but is occurring worldwide The phenomenon is being called peak soil as present largescale factory farming techniques are jeopardizing humanitys ability to grow food in the present and in the future Without efforts to improve soil management practices the availability of arable soil will become increasingly problematic Some soil management techniques Notill farming Keyline design Growing windbreaks to hold the soil Incorporating organic matter back into fields Stop using chemical fertilizers which contain salt Protecting soil from water runoff soil erosion Phosphate Phosphate is a primary component in the chemical fertilizer which is applied in modern agricultural production However scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that peak phosphorus will occur in about 2030 The phenomenon of peak phosphorus is expected to increase food prices as fertilizer costs increase as rock phosphate reserves become more difficult to extract In the long term phosphate will therefore have to be recovered and recycled from human and animal waste in order to maintain food production Land As the global population increases and demand for food increases there is pressure on land resources Land can also be considered a finite resource on Earth Expansion of agricultural land decreases biodiversity and contributes to deforestation The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development along with reclamation of wetlands and conversion of forest to cultivation resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion Energy for agriculture Main article Renewable energy Energy is used all the way down the food chain from farm to fork In industrial agriculture energy is used in onfarm mechanisation food processing storage and transportation processes It has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices Oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals Higher prices of nonrenewable energy resources are projected by the International Energy Agency Increased energy prices as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted may therefore decrease global food security unless action is taken to decouple fossil fuel energy from food production with a move towards energysmart agricultural systems The use of solar powered irrigation in Pakistan has come to be recognized as a leading example of energy use in creating a closed system for water irrigation in agricultural activity Economics Socioeconomic aspects of sustainability are also partly understood Regarding less concentrated farming the best known analysis is Nettings study on smallholder systems through history The Oxford Sustainable Group defines sustainability in this context in a much broader form considering effect on all stakeholders in a 360 degree approach Given the finite supply of natural resources at any specific cost and location agriculture that is inefficient or damaging to needed resources may eventually exhaust the available resources or the ability to afford and acquire them It may also generate negative externality such as pollution as well as financial and production costs There are several studies incooperating these negative externalities in an economic analysis concerning ecosystem services biodiversity land degradation and sustainable land management These include the The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity TEEB study led by Pavan Sukhdev and the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative which seeks to establish an economic cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture The way that crops are sold must be accounted for in the sustainability equation Food sold locally does not require additional energy for transportation including consumers Food sold at a remote location whether at a farmers market or the supermarket incurs a different set of energy cost for materials labour and transport Pursuing sustainable agriculture results in many localized benefits Having the opportunities to sell products directly to consumers rather than at wholesale or commodity prices allows farmers to bring in optimal profit Methods What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice Two of the many possible practices of sustainable agriculture are crop rotation and soil amendment both designed to ensure that crops being cultivated can obtain the necessary nutrients for healthy growth Soil amendments would include using locally available compost from community recycling centers These community recycling centers help produce the compost needed by the local organic farms Using community recycling from yard and kitchen waste utilizes a local areas commonly available resources These resources in the past were thrown away into large waste disposal sites are now used to produce low cost organic compost for organic farming Other practices includes growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil Nitrogen fixation from legumes for example used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth helps to allow the land to be reused annually Legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest Monoculture a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field is a very widespread practice but there are questions about its sustainability especially if the same crop is grown every year Today it is realized to get around this problem local cities and farms can work together to produce the needed compost for the farmers around them This combined with growing a mixture of crops polyculture sometimes reduces disease or pest problems but polyculture has rarely if ever been compared to the more widespread practice of growing different crops in successive years crop rotation with the same overall crop diversity Cropping systems that include a variety of crops polyculture andor rotation may also replenish nitrogen if legumes are included and may also use resources such as sunlight water or nutrients more efficiently Field Crops Res 34239 Replacing a natural ecosystem with a few specifically chosen plant varieties reduces the genetic diversity found in wildlife and makes the organisms susceptible to widespread disease The Great Irish Famine 1845–1849 is a wellknown example of the dangers of monoculture In practice there is no single approach to sustainable agriculture as the precise goals and methods must be adapted to each individual case There may be some techniques of farming that are inherently in conflict with the concept of sustainability but there is widespread misunderstanding on effects of some practices Today the growth of local farmers markets offer small farms the ability to sell the products that they have grown back to the cities that they got the recycled compost from By using local recycling this will help move people away from the slashandburn techniques that are the characteristic feature of shifting cultivators are often cited as inherently destructive yet slashandburn cultivation has been practiced in the Amazon for at least 6000 years serious deforestation did not begin until the 1970s largely as the result of Brazilian government programs and policies To note that it may not have been slashandburn so much as slashandchar which with the addition of organic matter produces terra preta one of the richest soils on Earth and the only one that regenerates itself There are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry Some of the key tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called paddocks lowering stock density and moving the stock between paddocks frequently Sustainable intensification Main article Intensive farming § Sustainable intensive farming In light of concerns about food security human population growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high crop yields while maintaining soil health and ecosystem services The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of synthetic non renewable inputs whilst maintaining or even boosting yields has been the subject of much debate Recent work in the globally important irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that in relation to pest management at least promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70 whilst delivering a 5 yield advantage compared with standard practice httpwwwnaturecomarticlesnplants201614 Soil treatment Soil steaming can be used as an ecological alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization Different methods are available to induce steam into the soil in order to kill pests and increase soil health Solarizing is based on the same principle used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests Certain crops act as natural biofumigants releasing pest suppressing compounds Mustard radishes and other plants in the brassica family are best known for this effect There exist varieties of mustard shown to be almost as effective as synthetic fumigants at a similar or lesser cost Offfarm impacts A farm that is able to produce perpetually yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is overapplication of synthetic fertilizer or animal manures which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters eutrophication The other extreme can also be undesirable as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to rainforest destruction as in the case of slash and burn farming for livestock feedIn Asia specific land for sustainable farming is about 125 acres which includes land for animal fodder cereals productions lands for some cash crops and even recycling of related food cropsIn some cases even a small unit of aquaculture is also included in this number AARI1996 Sustainability affects overall production which must increase to meet the increasing food and fiber requirements as the worlds human population expands to a projected 93 billion people by 2050 Increased production may come from creating new farmland which may ameliorate carbon dioxide emissions if done through reclamation of desert as in Israel and Palestine or may worsen emissions if done through slash and burn farming as in Brazil Social Development In 2007 the United Nations reported on Organic Agriculture and Food Security stating that using organic and sustainable agriculture could be used as a tool to reach global food security without expanding land usage and reducing environmental impacts Another way to define sustainable agriculture is to give attention to the human and environmental aspects because of the turn to a more unsustainable way of farming in US agriculture During the Great Depression in the United States many farming families were living in subhuman and hungry conditions and treated sustainability as a resourceinput and foodoutput equation Though conditions have improved the farming has not as much done so There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early 2000s stating that when people in their communities are not factoreed into the agricultural process that serious harm is done Although global food security would most likely not drastically fall these practices would impact first hand local rural farming communities making them unable to feed themselves and their families The social scientist Charles Kellogg has stated that In a final effort exploited people pass their suffering to the land This turn to more unsustainable farming has seen suffering for many people For if something is sustainable it should be that way in all aspects of it not just the crop yield or soil health It has been seen in the developing country of Bangladesh the starving of rural farming communities due to their unsustainable farming methods Sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously feed its constituent populations Women In the past 30 years 19782007 in the United States the number of women farm operators has tripled Today women operate 14 percent of farms compared to five percent in 1978 Much of the growth is due to women farming outside the male dominated field of conventional agriculture In community supported agriculture women represent 40 percent of farm operators and 21 percent of organic farmers With the change of laws in land ownership over the past century women are now allowed all the same freedom of land ownership that men have International policy Sustainable agriculture has become a topic of interest in the international policy arena especially with regards to its potential to reduce the risks associated with a changing climate and growing human population The Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade including in national research and development budgets land rehabilitation economic incentives and infrastructure improvement Policy Ethics Most agricultural professionals agree that there is a moral obligation to pursue the goal of sustainability The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal Because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population The best way to create policy for agriculture is to be free of any bias A good review would be done with practical wisdom a virtue identified by Aristotle distinguishing practical wisdom from scientific knowledge this coming from Nichomachean Ethics The science of agriculture is called agronomy the root of this word relating to scientific law Although agriculture may not fit well under scientific law and may not be designed to be treated as an Aristotelian scientific knowledge but more practical wisdom Practical wisdom requires recognition of past failures in agriculture to better attain a more sustainable agricultural system Urban planning There has been considerable debate about which form of human residential habitat may be a better social form for sustainable agriculture Many environmentalists advocate urban developments with high population density as a way of preserving agricultural land and maximizing energy efficiency However others have theorized that sustainable ecocities or ecovillages which combine habitation and farming with close proximity between producers and consumers may provide greater sustainability The use of available city space eg rooftop gardens community gardens garden sharing and other forms of urban agriculture for cooperative food production is another way to achieve greater sustainability One of the latest ideas in achieving sustainable agriculture involves shifting the production of food plants from major factory farming operations to large urban technical facilities called vertical farms The advantages of vertical farming include yearround production isolation from pests and diseases controllable resource recycling and onsite production that reduces transportation costs While a vertical farm has yet to become a reality the idea is gaining momentum among those who believe that current sustainable farming methods will be insufficient to provide for a growing global population Barriers Historical Since World War II agriculture in the United States and the entire national food system in its entirety has been characterized by models that focus on monetary profitability at the expense of social and environmental integrity Visible In sustainable agriculture changes in lower rates of soil and nutrient loss improved soil structure and higher levels of beneficial microorganisms are not quick The changes are not immediately evident to the operate when using sustainable agriculture In conventional agriculture the befits are easily visible with no weeds pests etc The process of externalization in conventional agriculture also hides the costs to soil and ecosystems around it A major barrier to sustainable agriculture is the lack of knowledge of all the benefits of it Much of the benefits are not visible so they are often unknown Criticism Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community however these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end Some foresee a true sustainable steady state economy that may be very different from todays greatly reduced energy usage minimal ecological footprint fewer consumer packaged goods local purchasing with short food supply chains little processed foods more home and community gardens etc Agriculture would be very different in this type of sustainable economy See also Agriculture and Agronomy
