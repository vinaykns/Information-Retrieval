 Power to gas also powertogas often abbreviated P2G is a technology that converts electrical power to a gas fuel When using surplus power from wind generation the concept is sometimes called windgas There are currently three methods in use all use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis In the first method the resulting hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry The second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide and convert the two gases to methane see natural gas using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8 The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid The third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the produced hydrogen from the electrolyzer to upgrade the quality of the biogas Impurities such as carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide and particulates must be removed from the biogas if the gas is used for pipeline storage to prevent damage Storage function Powertogas systems may be deployed as adjuncts to wind parks or solarelectric generation The excess power or offpeak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays may then be used at a later time for load balancing in the energy grid Before switching to natural gas the German gas networks were operated using towngas which for 50–60  consisted of hydrogen The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200000 GWh which is enough for several months of energy requirement By comparison the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GWh The storage requirement in Germany is estimated at 16GW in 2023 80GW in 2033 and 130GW in 2050 The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss 01 than in a power network 8 The storage costs per kilowatt hour are estimated at €010 for hydrogen and €015 for methane The use of the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen was studied by the EU NaturalHy project and US DOE The blending technology is also used in HCNG Efficiency In 2013 the roundtrip efficiency of powertogasstorage was well below 50 with the hydrogen path being able to reach an maximum efficiency of 43 and methane of 39 by using combinedcycle powerplants If cogeneration plants are used that produce both electricity and heat efficiency can be above 60 but is still less than pumped hydro or battery storage However there is potential to increase efficiency of powertogas storage In 2015 a study published in Energy and Environmental Science found that by using reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells and recycling waste heat in the storage process a roundtrip efficiency electricity to electricity of more than 70 can be reached at low cost Electrolysis technology Advantages and disadvantages of the predominantly considered electrolysis technologies Power to hydrogen In this method electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis The resulting hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry ITM Power won a tender in March 2013 for a Thüga Group project to supply a 360 kW selfpressurising high pressure electrolysis rapid response PEM electrolyser Rapid

Frankfurt in the state of Hessen The operational data will be shared by the whole Thüga group – the largest network of energy companies in Germany with around 100 municipal utility members The project partners include badenova AG Co kg Erdgas Mittelsachsen GmbH Energieversorgung Mittelrhein GmbH erdgas schwaben GmbH Gasversorgung Westerwald GmbH Mainova Aktiengesellschaft Stadtwerke Ansbach GmbH Stadtwerke Bad Hersfeld GmbH Thüga Energienetze GmbH WEMAG AG erp GmbH ESWE Versorgungs AG with Thüga Aktiengesellschaft as project coordinator Scientific partners will participate in the operational phase It can produce 60 cubic metres of hydrogen per hour and feed 3000 cubic metres of natural gas enriched with hydrogen into the grid per hour An expansion of the pilot plant is planned from 2016 facilitating the full conversion of the hydrogen produced into methane to be directly injected into the natural gas grid In December 2013 ITM Power Mainova and NRM Netzdienste RheinMain GmbH began injecting hydrogen into the German gas distribution network using ITM Power HGas which is a rapid response proton exchange membrane electrolyser plant The power consumption of the electrolyser is 315 kilowatts It produces about 60 cubic meters per hour of hydrogen and thus in one hour can feed 3000 cubic meters of hydrogenenriched natural gas into the network On August 28 2013 EON Hanse Solvicore and Swissgas inaugurated a commercial powertogas unit in Falkenhagen Germany The unit which has a capacity of two megawatts can produce 360 cubic meters of hydrogen per hour The plant uses wind power and Hydrogenics electrolysis equipment to transform water into hydrogen which is then injected into the existing regional natural gas transmission system Swissgas which represents over 100 local natural gas utilities is a partner in the project with a 20 percent capital stake and an agreement to purchase a portion of the gas produced A second 800 kW powertogas project has been started in HamburgReitbrook district and is expected to open in 2015 In August 2013 a 140 MW wind park in Grapzow MecklenburgVorpommern owned by EON received an electrolyser The hydrogen produced can be used in an internal combustion engine or can be injected into the local gas grid The hydrogen compression and storage system stores up to 27 MWh of energy and increases the overall efficiency of the wind park by tapping into wind energy that otherwise would be wasted The electrolyser produces 210 Nmh of hydrogen and is operated by RH2WKA In January 2011 Secure Supplies Hydrogen an internationally certified

injection into the gas network The surplus energy from the 12 MW Prenzlau Windpark in Brandenburg Germany will be injected into the gas grid from 2014 on The 6 MW Energiepark Mainz from Stadtwerke Mainz RheinMain University of Applied Sciences Linde and Siemens in Mainz Germany will open in 2015 Power to gas and other energy storage schemes to store and utilize renewable energy are part of Germanys Energiewende energy transition program Grid injection without compression The core of the system is a proton exchange membrane PEM electrolyser The electrolyser converts electrical energy into chemical energy which in turn facilitates the storage of electricity A gas mixing plant ensures that the proportion of hydrogen in the natural gas stream does not exceed two per cent by volume the technically permissible maximum value when a natural gas filling station is situated in the local distribution network The electrolyser supplies the hydrogenmethane mixture at the same pressure as the gas distribution network namely 35 bar Power to methane The Power to Gas Methane method is to combine hydrogen from an electrolyzer with carbon dioxide and convert the two gases to methane see natural gas using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8 the methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid if the purity requirement is reached ZSW Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research and SolarFuel GmbH now ETOGAS GmbH realized a demonstration project with 250 kW electrical input power in Stuttgart Germany The plant was put into operation on October 30 2012 The first industryscale PowertoMethane plant was realized by ETOGAS for Audi AG in Werlte Germany The plant with 6 MW electrical input power is using CO2 from a wastebiogas plant and intermittent renewable power to produce synthetic natural gas SNG which is directly fed into the local gas grid which is operated by EWE The plant is part of the Audi efuels program The produced synthetic natural gas named Audi egas enables CO2neutral mobility with standard CNG vehicles Currently it is available to customers of Audis first CNG car the Audi A3 gtron In April 2014 the European Union’s cofinanced and from the KIT coordinated HELMETH Integrated HighTemperature ELectrolysis and METHanation for Effective Power to Gas Conversion research project started The objective of the project is the proof of concept of a highly efficient PowertoGas technology by thermally integrating high temperature electrolysis SOEC technology with CO2methanation Through the thermal integration of exothermal methanation and steam generation for the high temperature steam electrolysis a conversion efficiency 85 is expected higher heating value of produced methane per used electrical energy The process consists of a pressurized hightemperature steam electrolysis and a pressurized CO2methanation module which are planned to be coupled in 2016 A methane output of approximately 30 kW higher heating value is targeted European demonstration project STOREGO The technological maturity of Power to Gas is evaluated in the European 27 partner project STOREGO which has started in March 2016 with a runtime of four years Three different technological concepts are demonstrated in three different European countries FalkenhagenGermany SolothurnSwitzerland TroiaItaly The technologies involved include biological and chemical methanation direct capture of CO2 from atmosphere liquefaction of the synthesized methane to bioLNG and direct injection into the gas grid The overall goal of the project is to assess those technologies and various usage paths under technical economic and legal aspects to identify business cases on the short and on the long term The project is cofunded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 18 million euro and the Swiss government 6 million euro with another 4 million euro coming from participating industrial partners The coordinator of the overall project is the research center of the DVGW located at the KIT Microbial methanation The biological methanation combines both processes the electrolysis of water to form hydrogen and the subsequent CO2 reduction to methane using this hydrogen During this process methane forming microorganisms methanogenic archaea or methanogens release enzymes that reduce the overpotential of a noncatalytic electrode the cathode so that it can produce hydrogen This microbial powertogas reaction occurs at ambient conditions ie room temperature and pH 7 at efficiencies that routinely reach 80100 However methane is formed more slowly than in the Sabatier reaction due to the lower temperatures A direct conversion of CO2 to methane has also been postulated circumventing the need for hydrogen production Microorganisms involved in the microbial powertogas reaction are typically members of the order Methanobacteriales Genera that were shown to catalyze this reaction are Methanobacterium Methanobrevibacter and Methanothermobacter thermophile Biogasupgrading to biomethane In the third method the carbon dioxide in the output of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the produced hydrogen from the electrolyzer to produce methane The free heat coming from the electrolyzer is used to cut heating costs in the biogas plant The impurities carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide and particulates must be removed from the biogas if the gas is used for pipeline storage to prevent damage 2014Avedøre wastewater Services in Avedøre Kopenhagen Denmark is adding a 1 MW electrolyzer plant to upgrade the anaerobic digestion biogas from sewage sludge The produced hydrogen is used with the carbon dioxide from the biogas in a Sabatier reaction to produce methane Electrochaea is testing another project outside P2G BioCat with biocatalytic methanation The company uses an adapted strain of the thermophilic methanogen Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus and has demonstrated its technology at laboratoryscale in an industrial environment A precommercial demonstration project with a
