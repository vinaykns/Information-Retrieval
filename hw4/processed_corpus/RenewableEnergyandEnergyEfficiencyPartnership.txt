 The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership REEEP is a Viennabased international organisation link in German that advances markets for renewable energy and energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on the emerging markets and developing countries Its primary focus is in derisking and scaling up clean energy business models REEEP was originally launched by the government of the United Kingdom along with other partners at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development WSSD in August 2002 Origins In 2002 accelerating the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was one of the priorities of a large group of countries at the WSSD Margaret Beckett then UK Minister for the Environment announced the initiative to form REEEP at the summit’s closing session It grew from an agreement with other committed governments businesses and NGOs to deliver WSSD commitments others in particular to take forward the key recommendations of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force From January 2003 until May 2004 the REEEP was housed within the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO where it continued following the UN Type II Partnership process of stakeholder consultation In June 2004 REEEP obtained formal legal nonprofit status as an international NGO and has since been located at the UN complex in Vienna Austria In 2016 REEEP was granted status as a quasiinternational organisation in Austria along with four other organisations Business model It pursues its market catalyst role via an approach it calls Invest – Learn – Share Invest A typical REEEP InvestLearnShare effort begins with a country or regional level analysis to determine market gaps and opportunities for clean technology deployment a stakeholder landscape to understand key players and influencers and an assessment of medium to longterm 5 to 15year market potential for delivering climate and sustainable development outcomes These assessments are synthesised into a project strategy outlining technology and sector targets investment vehicles and volumes policy and regulatory considerations ecosystem stakeholders and evidence requirements and engagement strategies The investment solicitation and selection process begins once capitalisation has been secured through donor agreements The process is typically launched via a call for proposals Specifics of the call are adaptable and depend on the realities of the market as well as upon timing and administrative requirements of donors and local stakeholders In some cases multiple capital pools may be combined into a single call for proposals in other cases beneficiaries are identified through recommendations from expert networks and approached on an ad hoc basis In those cases where capitalisation is provided through a debtissuing revolving fund smaller calls for proposals may be issued as the fund is recapitalised by loan repayments These innovative vehicles represent a promising new approach to growing investment in sectors that have fallen through the finance cracks due to ticket sizes too large for microfinance too small for private equity or commercial debt As part of a proposal SMEs are required to submit an application form including a draft business plan demonstrating their ability to provide a viable clean technologybased product or service to a market in a least developed country LDC or middleincome country MIC SMEs are challenged to demonstrate how a business plan will lead to certain outcomes connected to REEEP’s core principles reducing the effects of climate change and building local prosperity In some cases these outcomes may be integrated into the selection processes as specific procurement objectives allowing for resultsbased financing After initial application and due diligence process successful applicants develop a strategic plan incorporating a stakeholder analysis key activities outputs and outcomes benchmarking and key performance indicators KPIs and contingency planning among other elements This strategic plan forms the basis of entry as a project investment Throughout its work REEEP uses ResultsBased Finance methods to verify project progress Learn REEEP utilises a mixed methodology approach to monitoring evaluation and learning designed to handle the complexity of the situations our investments face on the ground and the multiplicity of stakeholders involved and to manage the various types and volumes of information f lowing in and out of the project environment REEEP uses a Theory of Change as a high level project strategy guide taking into account market context and crosscutting considerations For each investment REEEP makes as part of a market acceleration project it develops a SMEspecific strategic plan that incorporates a stakeholder analysis key activities outputs and outcomes benchmarking and key performance indicators KPIs and contingency planning among other elements This strategy typically includes a Logical Framework Approach Logframe template The plan is designed to ensure that the investment logic will lead to project objectives We internally test the business plan including activities structure and strategy for growth to confirm they have been adequately planned to deliver a high probability of success In cases where intelligence and evidence from similar projects would suggest altering the business plan we will consult with the submitter on making appropriate changes REEEP also works with entrepreneurs to perform Outcome Mapping a critical element of any project that relies on specific actions or behavioural changes from a broad group of stakeholders amid imperfect market settings The Outcome Mapping begins with an analysis of stakeholders — individuals organisations government bodies etc — who influence the ability of a project to reach an objective In doing so REEEP tests entrepreneurs’ understanding of the stakeholder landscape Are they aware of existing and potential competitors Do they understand customer needs and unique characteristics Are they relying upon a policy change in the future for their business model to be viable and if so what are they doing to bring the change about We track identified behavioural changes or nonchanges that occur throughout the project By understanding people relationships and behaviours we can allow for realtime reflection and rapid reaction Finally REEEP captures significant changes and impacts through a method of storytelling with an open format dialogue These changes — known as Most Significant Changes — can be planned or unplanned positive or negative and the precise nature of these changes may be equally unknown beforehand By recording and processing these elements we can adjust business plans project scope or overall strategy if necessary Combining these components leads to a holistic framework greater than the sum of its parts which captures a broad range of key information and variety that make up the complex systems in which we are operating Share Market intelligence produced by the Monitoring Evaluation and Learning process is directed into three information flows the first is a dynamic feedback loop into the Theory of Change and project strategy review the other two are outward flows of business intelligence and policy intelligence respectively Commercial intelligence comprises the full range of business and investmentrelated data and insights which are further processed to derive actionable commercial best practices These are anonymised and synthesised to advise other SME investments in the REEEP portfolio on best practices At the same time REEEP generates actionable investment intelligence which can influence or even lead to concrete investment pipelines for larger investors multilateral development banks impact investors venture growth capital funds mezzanine funds etc This intelligence is a critical derisking mechanism for specific downstream investors as well as the investment climate in general Policy intelligence comprising data and information on the ecosystem conditions of specific markets including legal regulatory economic and political circumstances that act as external influencers on business and market activity are further processed to derive actionable practicebased policy learning and recommendations These can be utilised by partner organisations and decision makers involved in legislation andor other policy and regulatory development processes The form of REEEP’s practicedbased policy will vary depending upon case to fit the needs of the policy making process in question Although there is a logical sequence to the InvestLearnShare approach this does not imply rigidity in timing rather it is an iterative process in which stakeholders such as regulators policy makers and financial actors are included early and at regular intervals in the project throughout its lifetime To date the organisation has been funded primarily by governments including Australia Austria Canada Germany Ireland Italy Spain Switzerland The Netherlands The United Kingdom The United States and the European Commission Project interventions In the first phase of its existence 20022014 REEEP acted largely as a regranting institution funding nearly 200 projects The majority have targeted emerging markets such as India China South Africa and Brazil These REEEP projects attempted to address two key barriers to clean energy development and gather and aggregate information on them Policy and regulation promoting clear government policies and favourable transparent and stable regulatory frameworks that will encourage longterm investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency Innovative finance and business models supporting new forms of financing risk mitigation and business models to make smallsized renewable and energy efficient projects bankable Since 2014 REEEP dramatically focused its work toward the targeted derisking of specific markets and sectors such as solarpowered irrigation systems in East Africa solarpowered dairy cooling in Bangladesh or innovative decentralized minigrid models in Tanzania Regionally REEEP has shifted concentration to low and middleincome countries although it continues to work in India and South Africa which are generally considered to be emerging markets East Africa Kenya Tanzania Uganda Southern Africa South Africa Zambia Botswana Southeast Asia Cambodia Myanmar South Asia India Bangladesh Nepal REEEPs ongoing projects include Power Africa Beyond the Grid Fund for Zambia a major fund to stimulate markets for offgrid electrification solutions in Zambia Powering Agrifood Value Chains a project to develop evidencebased intervention guidance for energy utilisation in the foodproducing agricultural sector Climate Change Clean Energy and Urban Water Works in Southern Africa a joint REEEPUNIDO project to accelerate marketbased solutions for energyrelated investment to improve municipal water works in Southern Africa SWITCH Africa Green a project to support African countries in their transition to an Inclusive Green Economy and promoting sustainable consumption and production SCP practices and patterns Climate Knowledge Brokers Group a community of practice that furthers improvements and efficiency gains in the global climate knowledge system Internetbased resources Climate Tagger Climate Tagger is a project to help organizations catalog their data and information in a consistent manner reegleinfo reegle in lowercase is a clean energy information portal designed to provide easy access to highly reliable information on renewable energy and energy efficiency The website draws information from eight different open data sources such as the World Bank UNdata OpenEI the CIA Factbook and the REEEP Sustainable Energy Regulation Network publications to provide understanding of energy issues The portal has four main components country energy profiles that bring energy statistics together with current policies regulations and stakeholder contact information together in one single dossier for each nation a climate change glossary and thesaurus covering the broad fields of climate change mitigation adaptation international development incorporating 1700 terms with links to synonyms as well as broader and narrower terms a clean energy web search which offers a mind map based search refinement a catalogue of key stakeholders involved in renewable energy and energy efficiency This contains information and links to governmental ministries companies and other green organisations crossreferenced by geographical area and subject matter reegle was developed by REEEP in collaboration with REN21 and was funded by the governments of Germany Netherlands United Kingdom As of March 2012 the website attracted an average of 220000 users per month During 2011 59 of its users came from Africa and Asia underlining the site’s character as an information resource for developing countries and emerging markets reegle is an advocate of the Linked Open Data movement which seeks to make public data available on the web in open formats that are
