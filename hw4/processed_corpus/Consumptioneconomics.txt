 Spend redirects here For The Walking Dead episode see Spend The Walking Dead Consumption is major concept in economics and is also studied by many other social sciences Economists are particularly interested in the relationship between consumption and income as modeled with the consumption function Different schools of economists define production and consumption differently According to mainstream economists only the final purchase of goods and services by individuals constitutes consumption while other types of expenditure — in particular fixed investment intermediate consumption and government spending — are placed in separate categories See consumer choice Other economists define consumption much more broadly as the aggregate of all economic activity that does not entail the design production and marketing of goods and services eg the selection adoption use disposal and recycling of goods and services Consumption function Main article Consumption function The consumption function is a mathematical function that expresses consumer spending in terms of its determinants such as income and accumulated wealth Behavioural economics and consumption The Keynesian consumption function is also known as the absolute income hypothesis as it only bases consumption on current income and ignores potential future income or lack of Criticism of this assumption led to the development of Milton Friedmans permanent income hypothesis and Franco Modiglianis life cycle hypothesis More recent theoretical approaches are based on behavioral economics and suggest that a number of behavioural principles can be taken as microeconomic foundations for a behaviourallybased aggregate consumption function Consumption and household production Consumption is defined in part by comparison to production In the tradition of the Columbia School of Household Economics also known as the New Home Economics commercial consumption has to be analyzed in the context of household production The opportunity cost of time affects the cost of homeproduced substitutes and therefore demand for commercial goods and services The elasticity of demand for consumption goods is also a function of who performs chores in households and how their spouses compensate them for opportunity costs of home production Different schools of economists define production and consumption

environmental resource base It is exacerbating inequalities And the dynamics of the consumptionpovertyinequalityenvironment nexus are accelerating If the trends continue without change — not redistributing from highincome to lowincome consumers not shifting from polluting to cleaner goods and production technologies not shifting priority from consumption for conspicuous display to meeting basic needs — today’s problems of consumption and human development will worsen Developing countries like India as they move down the path of copying the consumption patterns of developed economies will basically create demands that earth will not be able to fulfill Some economists talk about putting a price on using earths resources which is in addition to the cost of just extracting them
