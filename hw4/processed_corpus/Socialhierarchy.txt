 Social stratification is a societys categorization of people into socioeconomic strata based upon their occupation and income wealth and social status or derived power social and political As such stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group category geographic region or social unit In modern Western societies social stratification typically is distinguished as three social classes i the upper class ii the middle class and iii the lower class in turn each class can be subdivided into strata eg the upperstratum the middlestratum and the lower stratum Moreover a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship or caste or both The categorization of people by social strata occurs in all societies ranging from the complex statebased or polycentric societies to tribal and feudal societies which are based upon socioeconomic relations among classes of nobility and classes of peasants Historically whether or not huntergatherer societies can be defined as socially stratified or if social stratification began with agriculture and common acts of social exchange remains a debated matter in the social sciences Determining the structures of social stratification arises from inequalities of status among persons therefore the degree of social inequality determines a persons social stratum Generally the greater the social complexity of a society the more social strata exist by way of social differentiation Overview Definition and usage Social stratification is a term used in the social sciences to describe the relative social position of persons in a given social group category geographical region or other social unit It derives from the Latin strātum plural strata parallel horizontal layers referring to a given society’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth income social status occupation and power In modern Western societies stratification is often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class upper class middle class and lower class Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes eg upper middle Social strata may also be delineated on the basis of kinship ties or caste relations The concept of social stratification is often used and interpreted differently within specific theories In sociology for example proponents of action theory have suggested that social stratification is commonly found in developed societies wherein a dominance hierarchy may be necessary in order to maintain social order and provide a stable social structure Socalled conflict theories such as Marxism point to the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility found in stratified societies Many sociological theorists have criticized the extent to which the working classes are unlikely to advance socioeconomically while the wealthy tend to hold political power which they use to exploit the proletariat laboring class Talcott Parsons an American sociologist asserted that stability and social order are regulated in part by universal values Such values are not identical with consensus but can as well be an impetus for ardent social conflict as it has been multiple times through history Parsons never claimed that universal values in and by themselves satisfied the functional prerequisites of a society Indeed the constitution of society is a much more complicated codification of emerging historical factors Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf alternately note the tendency toward an enlarged middleclass in modern Western societies due to the necessity of an educated workforce in technological economies Various social and political perspectives concerning globalization such as dependency theory suggest that these effects are due to change in the status of workers to the third world Four underlying principles Four principles are posited to underlie social stratification First social stratification is socially defined as a property of a society rather than individuals in that society Second social stratification is reproduced from generation to generation Third social stratification is universal found in every society but variable differs across time and place Fourth social stratification involves not just quantitative inequality but qualitative beliefs and attitudes about social status Complexity Although stratification is not limited to complex societies all complex societies exhibit features of stratification In any complex society the total stock of valued goods is distributed unequally wherein the most privileged individuals and families enjoy a disproportionate share of income power and other valued resources The term stratification system is sometimes used to refer to the complex social relationships and social structure that generate these observed inequalities The key components of such systems are a socialinstitutional processes that define certain types of goods as valuable and desirable b the rules of allocation that distribute goods and resources across various positions in the division of labor eg physician farmer ‘housewife’ and c the social mobility processes that link individuals to positions and thereby generate unequal control over valued resources Social mobility Social mobility is the movement of individuals social groups or categories of people between the layers or strata in a stratification system This movement can be intragenerational within a generation or intergenerational between two or more generations Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification Open stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between strata typically by placing value on the achieved status characteristics of individuals Those societies having the highest levels of intragenerational mobility are considered to be the most open and malleable systems of stratification Those systems in which there is little to no mobility even on an intergenerational basis are considered closed stratification systems For example in caste systems all aspects of social status are ascribed such that ones social position at birth is the position one holds for a lifetime Theories of stratification Historical Karl Marx Main articles Marxism Historical materialism and Base and superstructure In Marxist theory the modern mode of production consists of two main economic parts the base and the superstructure The base encompasses the relations of production employer–employee work conditions the technical division of labour and property relations Social class according to Marx is determined by ones relationship to the means of production There exist at least two classes in any classbased society the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labor to the owners of the means of production At times Marx almost hints that the ruling classes seem to own the working class itself as they only have their own labor power wage labor to offer the more powerful in order to survive These relations fundamentally determine the ideas and philosophies of a society and additional classes may form as part of the superstructure Through the ideology of the ruling class—throughout much of history the landowning aristocracy— false consciousness is promoted both through political and nonpolitical institutions but also through the arts and other elements of culture When the aristocracy falls the bourgeoisie become the owners of the means of production in the capitalist system Marx predicted the capitalist mode would eventually give way through its own internal conflict to revolutionary consciousness and the development of more egalitarian more communist societies Marx also described two other classes the petite bourgeoisie and the lumpenproletariat The petite bourgeoisie is like a small business class that never really accumulates enough profit to become part of the bourgeoisie or even challenge their status The lumpenproletariat is the underclass those with little to no social status This includes prostitutes beggars the homeless or other untouchables in a given society Neither of these subclasses has much influence in Marxs two major classes but it is helpful to know that Marx did recognize differences within the classes According to Marvin Harris and Tim Ingold Lewis Henry Morgans accounts of egalitarian huntergatherers formed part of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels inspiration for communism Morgan spoke of a situation in which people living in the same community pooled their efforts and shared the rewards of those efforts fairly equally He called this communism in living But when Marx expanded on these ideas he still emphasized an economically oriented culture with property defining the fundamental relationships between people Yet issues of ownership and property are arguably less emphasized in huntergatherer societies This combined with the very different social and economic situations of huntergatherers may account for many of the difficulties encountered when implementing communism in industrialized states As Ingold points out The notion of communism removed from the context of domesticity and harnessed to support a project of social engineering for largescale industrialized states with populations of millions eventually came to mean something quite different from what Morgan had intended namely a principle of redistribution that would override all ties of a personal or familial nature and cancel out their effects The counterargument to Marxists conflict theory is the theory of structural functionalism argued by Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore which states that social inequality places a vital role in the smooth operation of a society The DavisMoore hypothesis that a position does not bring power and prestige because it draws a high income Rather it draws a high income because it is functionally important and the available personnel is for one reason or another scarce” Most highincome jobs are difficult and require a high level of education to perform and their compensation is a motivator in society for people to strive to achieve more Max Weber Main articles Threecomponent theory of stratification and Tripartite classification of authority Max Weber was strongly influenced by Marxs ideas but rejected the possibility of effective communism arguing that it would require an even greater level of detrimental social control and bureaucratization than capitalist society Moreover Weber criticized the dialectical presumption of a proletariat revolt maintaining it to be unlikely Instead he develops a threecomponent theory of stratification and the concept of life chances Weber held there are more class divisions than Marx suggested taking different concepts from both functionalist and Marxist theories to create his own system He emphasizes the difference between class status and power and treats these as separate but related sources of power each with different effects on social action Working half a century later than Marx Weber claims there to be four main social classes the upper class the white collar workers the petite bourgeoisie and the manual working class Webers theory moreclosely resembles contemporary Western class structures although economic status does not currently seem to depend strictly on earnings in the way Weber envisioned Weber derives many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of Germany He notes that contrary to Marxs theories stratification is based on more than simple ownership of capital Weber examines how many members of the aristocracy lacked economic wealth yet had strong political power Many wealthy families lacked prestige and power for example because they were Jewish Weber introduced three independent factors that form his theory of stratification hierarchy which are class status and power Class A persons economic position in a society based on birth and individual achievement Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification Weber notes how corporate executives control firms they typically do not own Marx would have placed these people in the proletariat despite their high incomes by virtue of the fact they sell their labor instead of owning capital Status A persons prestige social honor or popularity in a society Weber notes that political power is not rooted in capital value solely but also in ones individual status Poets or saints for example can have extensive influence on society despite few material resources Power A persons ability to get their way despite the resistance of others particularly in their ability to engage social change For example individuals in government jobs such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or a member of the United States Congress may hold little property or status but still wield considerable social power C Wright Mills Main article Elite theory C Wright Mills drawing from the theories of Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca contends that the imbalance of power in society derives from the complete absence of countervailing powers against corporate leaders of the Power elite Mills both incorporated and revised Marxist ideas While he shared Marxs recognition of a dominant wealthy and powerful class Mills believed that the source for that power lay not only in the economic realm but also in the political and military arenas During the 1950s Mills stated that hardly anyone knew about the power elites existence some individuals including the elite themselves denied the idea of such a group and other people vaguely believed that a small formation of a powerful elite existed Some prominent individuals knew that Congress had permitted a handful of political leaders to make critical decisions about peace and war and that two atomic bombs had been dropped on Japan in the name of the United States but neither they nor anyone they knew had been consulted Mills explains that the power elite embody a privileged class whose members are able to recognize their high position within society In order to maintain their highly exalted position within society members of the power elite tend to marry one another understand and accept one another and also work together The most crucial aspect of the power elites existence lays within the core of education Youthful upperclass members attend prominent preparatory schools which not only open doors to such elite universities as Harvard Yale and Princeton but also to the universities highly exclusive clubs These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts Examples of elite members who attended prestigious universities and were members of highly exclusive clubs can be seen in George W Bush and John Kerry Both Bush and Kerry were members of the Skull and Bones club while attending Yale University This club includes members of some of the most powerful men of the twentieth century all of which are forbidden to tell others about the secrets of their exclusive club Throughout the years the Skull and Bones club has included presidents cabinet officers Supreme Court justices spies captains of industry and often their sons and daughters join the exclusive club creating a social and political network like none ever seen before The upper class individuals who receive elite educations typically have the essential background and contacts to enter into the three branches of the power elite The political leadership the military circle and the corporate elite The Political Leadership Mills held that prior to the end of World War II leaders of corporations became more prominent within the political sphere along with a decline in central decisionmaking among professional politicians The Military Circle During the 1950s1960s increasing concerns about warfare resulted in top military leaders and issues involving defense funding and military personnel training becoming a top priority within the United States Most of the prominent politicians and corporate leaders have been strong proponents of military spending The Corporate Elite Mills explains that during the 1950s when the military emphasis was recognized corporate leaders worked with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies Corporate leaders and highranking military officers were mutually supportive of each other Mills shows that the power elite has an innercore made up of individuals who are able to move from one position of institutional power to another for example a prominent military officer who becomes a political adviser or a powerful politician who becomes a corporate executive These people have more knowledge and a greater breadth of interests than their colleagues Prominent bankers and financiers who Mills considered almost professional gobetweens of economic political and military affairs are also members of the elites inner core Anthropological theories Anthropologists dispute the universal nature of social stratification holding that it is not the standard among all societies John Gowdy 2006 writes Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive and that social stratification is natural do not apply to many huntergatherer peoples Nonstratified egalitarian or acephalous headless societies exist which have little or no concept of social hierarchy political or economic status class or even permanent leadership Kinshiporientation See also Original affluent society Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as kinshiporiented because they appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status These cultures are contrasted with economically oriented cultures including states in which status and material wealth are prized and stratification competition and conflict are common Kinshiporiented cultures actively work to prevent social hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could lead to conflict and instability Reciprocal altruism is one process by which this is accomplished A good example is given by Richard Borshay Lee in his account of the Khoisan who practice insulting the meat Whenever a hunter makes a kill he is ceaselessly teased and ridiculed in a friendly joking fashion to prevent him from becoming too proud or egotistical The meat itself is then distributed evenly among the entire social group rather than kept by the hunter The level of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill Lee found this out when he purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with and was teased for weeks afterward about it since obtaining that much meat could be interpreted as showing off Another example is the Indigenous Australians of Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island off the coast of Arnhem Land who have arranged their entire society—spiritually and economically—around a kind of gift economy called renunciation According to David H Turner in this arrangement every person is expected to give everything of any resource they have to any other person who needs or lacks it at the time This has the benefit of largely eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty However misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal renunciative economics with the competitionscarcityoriented economics introduced to Australia by AngloEuropean colonists Variables in theory and research The social status variables underlying social stratification are based in social perceptions and attitudes about various characteristics of persons and peoples While many such variables cut across time and place the relative weight placed on each variable and specific combinations of these variables will differ from place to place over time One task of research is to identify accurate mathematical models that explain how these many variables combine to produce stratification in a given society Grusky 2011 provides a good overview of the historical development of sociological theories of social stratification and a summary of contemporary theories and research in this field While many of the variables that contribute to an understanding of social stratification have long been identified models of these variables and their role in constituting social stratification are still an active topic of theory and research In general sociologists recognize that there are no pure economic variables as social factors are integral to economic value However the variables posited to affect social stratification can be loosely divided into economic and other social factors Economic Main article Economic inequality Strictly quantitative economic variables are more useful to describing social stratification than explaining how social stratification is constituted or maintained Income is the most common variable used to describe stratification and associated economic inequality in a society However the distribution of individual or household accumulation of surplus and wealth tells us more about variation in individual wellbeing than does income alone Wealth variables can also more vividly illustrate salient variations in the wellbeing of groups in stratified societies Gross Domestic Product GDP especially per capita GDP is sometimes used to describe economic inequality and stratification at the international or global level Social Main article Social status Social variables both quantitative and qualitative typically provide the most explanatory power in causal research regarding social stratification either as independent variables or as intervening variables Three important social variables include gender race and ethnicity which at the least have an intervening effect on social status and stratification in most places throughout the world Additional variables include those that describe other ascribed and achieved characteristics such as occupation and skill levels age education level education level of parents and geographic area Some of these variables may have both causal and intervening effects on social status and stratification For example absolute age may cause a low income if one is too young or too old to perform productive work The social perception of age and its role in the workplace which may lead to ageism typically has an intervening effect on employment and income Social scientists are sometimes interested in quantifying the degree of economic stratification between different social categories such as men and women or workers with different levels of education An index of stratification has been recently proposed by Zhou for this purpose Gender Main article Gender inequality Gender is one of the most pervasive and prevalent social characteristics which people use to make social distinctions between individuals Gender distinctions are found in economic kinship and castebased stratification systems Social role expectations often form along sex and gender lines Entire societies may be classified by social scientists according to the rights and privileges afforded to men or women especially those associated with ownership and inheritance of property In patriarchal societies such rights and privileges are normatively granted to men over women in matriarchal societies the opposite holds true Sex and genderbased division of labor is historically found in the annals of most societies and such divisions increased with the advent of industrialization Sexbased wage discrimination exists in some societies such that men typically receive higher wages than women for the same type of work Other differences in employment between men and women lead to an overall genderbased paygap in many societies where women as a category earn less than men due to the types of jobs which women are offered and take as well as to differences in the number of hours worked by women These and other genderrelated values affect the distribution of income wealth and property in a given social order Race Main article Racism Racism consists of both prejudice and discrimination based in social perceptions of observable biological differences between peoples It often takes the form of social actions practices or beliefs or political systems in which different races are perceived to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other based on presumed shared inheritable traits abilities or qualities In a given society those who share racial characteristics socially perceived as undesirable are typically underrepresented in positions of social power ie they become a minority category in that society Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies including assimilation exclusion oppression expulsion and extermination Overt racism usually feeds directly into a stratification system through its effect on social status For example members associated with a particular race may be assigned a slave status a form of oppression in which the majority refuses to grant basic rights to a minority that are granted to other members of the society More covert racism such as that which many scholars posit is practiced in more contemporary societies is socially hidden and less easily detectable Covert racism often feeds into stratification systems as an intervening variable affecting income educational opportunities and housing Both overt and covert racism can take the form of structural inequality in a society in which racism has become institutionalized Ethnicity Main article Ethnocentricity Ethnic prejudice and discrimination operate much the same as do racial prejudice and discrimination in society In fact only recently have scholars begun to differentiate race and ethnicity historically the two were considered to be identical or closely related With the scientific development of genetics and the human genome as fields of study most scholars now recognize that race is socially defined on the basis of biologically determined characteristics that can be observed within a society while ethnicity is defined on the basis of culturally learned behavior Ethnic identification can include shared cultural heritage such as language and dialect symbolic systems religion mythology and cuisine As with race ethnic categories of persons may be socially defined as minority categories whose members are underrepresented in positions of social power As such ethnic categories of persons can be subject to the same types of majority policies For example the Bosnian war that took place in the 1990s was accompanied by a threat of extermination called ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Bosniak and Croat population especially in eastern Bosnia and throughout the Republika Srpska Whether ethnicity feeds into a stratification system as a direct causal factor or as an intervening variable may depend on the level of ethnocentrism within each of the various ethnic populations in a society the amount of conflict over scarce resources and the relative social power held within each ethnic category Global stratification Main articles Worldsystems theory and Dependency theory The world and the pace of social change today are very different than in the time of Karl Marx Max Weber or even C Wright Mills Globalizing forces lead to rapid international integration arising from the interchange of world views products ideas and other aspects of culture Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure including the rise of the telegraph and its posterity the Internet are major factors in globalization generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities Like a stratified class system within a nation looking at the world economy one can see class positions in the unequal distribution of capital and other resources between nations Rather than having separate national economies nations are considered as participating in this world economy The world economy manifests a global division of labor with three overarching classes core countries semiperiphery countries and periphery countries according to Worldsystems and Dependency theories Core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higherlevel production tasks and provide international financial services Periphery nations own very little of the worlds means of production even when factories are located in periphery nations and provide low to nonskilled labor Semiperipheral nations are midway between the core and periphery They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies Core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production and periphery nations receive the least Furthermore core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from noncore nations at low prices while demanding higher prices for their exports to noncore nations A global workforce employed through a system of global labor arbitrage ensures that companies in core countries can utilize the cheapest semiand nonskilled labor for production Today we have the means to gather and analyze data from economies across the globe Although many societies worldwide have made great strides toward more equality between differing geographic regions in terms of the standard of living and life chances afforded to their peoples we still find large gaps between the wealthiest and the poorest within a nation and between the wealthiest and poorest nations of the world A January 2014 Oxfam report indicates that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50 of the worlds population or about 35 billion people By contrast for 2012 the World Bank reports that 21 percent of people worldwide around 15 billion live in extreme poverty at or below 125 a day Zygmunt Bauman has provocatively observed that the rise of the rich is linked to their capacity to lead highly mobile lives Mobility climbs to the rank of the uppermost among coveted values and the freedom to move perpetually a scarce and unequally distributed commodity fast becomes the main stratifying factor of our late modern or postmodern time See also Sociology portal Age stratification Caste system Systems of social
