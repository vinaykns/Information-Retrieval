 A sustainable city or ecocity also ecocity is a city designed with consideration of environmental impact inhabited by people dedicated towards minimization of required inputs of energy water and food and waste output of heat air pollution CO2 methane and water pollution Richard Register first coined the term ecocity in his 1987 book Ecocity Berkeley Building Cities for a Healthy Future Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are architect Paul F Downton who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd and authors Timothy Beatley and Steffen Lehmann who have written extensively on the subject The field of industrial ecology is sometimes used in planning these cities There remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included Generally developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable Ideally a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology economics politics and culture However minimally a sustainable city should firstly be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding countryside Secondly it should be able to power itself with renewable sources of energy The crux of this is to create the smallest possible ecological footprint and to produce the lowest quantity of pollution possible to efficiently use land compost used materials recycle it or convert wastetoenergy and thus the citys overall contribution to climate change will be minimal if such practices are adhered to It is estimated that over 50 of the world’s population now lives in cities and urban areas These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for environmentallyconscious developers and there are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections Because of this a shift to more dense urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper Contrary to common belief urban systems can be more environmentally sustainable than rural or suburban living With people and resource located so close to one another it is possible to save energy for transportation and mass transit systems and resources such as food Finally cities benefit the economy by locating human capital in one relatively small geographic area where ideas can be generated Practical achievement These ecological cities are achieved through various means such as Different agricultural systems such as agricultural plots within the city suburbs or centre This reduces the distance food has to travel from field to fork Practical work out of this may be done by either small scaleprivate farming plots or through larger scale agriculture eg farmscrapers Renewable energy sources such as wind turbines solar panels or biogas created from sewage Cities provide economies of scale that make such energy sources viable Various methods to reduce the need for air conditioning a massive energy demand such as planting trees and lightening surface colors natural ventilation systems an increase in water features and green spaces equaling at least 20 of the citys surface These measures counter the heat island effect caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas—as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening Improved public transport and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions This requires a radically different approach to city planning with integrated business industrial and residential zones Roads may be designed to make driving difficult Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of urban heat islands Solutions to decrease urban sprawl by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace Since the workplace tends to be in the city downtown or urban center they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards innercity areas One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the Smart Growth Movement Green roofs Sustainable transport Zeroenergy building Sustainable urban drainage systems or SUDS energy conservation systemsdevices Xeriscaping garden and landscape design for water conservation Key Performance Indicators development and operational management tool providing guidance and MV for city administrators Architecture Buildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning building and restructuring Ecoindustrial park The purpose of an ecoindustrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues such as energy water and materials The components for building an ecoindustrial park include natural systems more efficient use of energy and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts which can be accomplished through plant design landscaping and choice of materials For instance there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials The landscaping of the building will include native trees grasses and flowers and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility In choosing the materials for building an ecoindustrial park designers must consider the lifecycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power In terms of material flows the companies in an ecoindustrial park may have common waste treatment facilities a means for transporting byproducts from one plant to another or anchoring the park around resource recovery companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff Urban farming Urban farming is the process of growing and distributing food as well as raising animals in and around a city or in urban area According to the RUAF Foundation urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem Such linkages include the use of urban residents as labourers use of typical urban resources like organic waste as compost and urban wastewater for irrigation direct links with urban consumers direct impacts on urban ecology positive and negative being part of the urban food system competing for land with other urban functions being influenced by urban policies and plans etc There are many motivations behind urban agriculture but in the context of creating a sustainable city this method of food cultivation saves energy in food transportation and saves costs In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system Read more on the Urban Agriculture page Urban infill Many cities are currently in a shift from the suburban sprawl model of development to a return to urban dense living This shift in geographic distribution of population leads to a denser core of city residents These residents provide a growing demand in many sectors that is reflected in the architectural fabric of the city This new demand can be supplied by new construction or historic rehabilitation Sustainable cities will opt for historical rehabilitation wherever possible Having people live in higher densities not only gives economies of scale but also allows for infrastructure to be more efficient Walkable urbanism Walkable urbanism is a development strategy in opposition to suburban sprawl It advocates housing for a diverse population a full mix of uses walkable streets positive public space integrated civic and commercial centers transit orientation and accessible open space It also advocates for density and accessibility of commercial and government activity New Urbanism The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of New Urbanism It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support sustainable transport Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth walkability architectural tradition and classical design This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl Both trends started in the 1980s Individual buildings LEED Main article Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is an internationally recognized green building certification system LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including Sustainable Sites Water Efficiency Energy and Atmosphere Materials and Resources Indoor Environmental Quality Locations Linkages Awareness and Education Innovation in Design Regional Priority In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design construction and use One example of sustainable design would be including a certified wood like bamboo Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency Transportation As major focus of the sustainable cities sustainable transportation attempts to reduce a city’s reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly urban planning low environmental impact vehicles and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and social equity Due to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city’s energy consumption the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts Currently transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world’s energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers The Carbon Trust states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times better land use planning modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport and making existing transport modes more efficient Car free city The concept of Car free cities or a city with large pedestrian areas is often part of the design of a sustainable city A large part of the carbon footprint of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city Emphasis on proximity Created by eco friendly urban planning the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking Furthermore close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating a part of their commute time See also Compact City and Pocket neighborhood Diversity in modes of transportation Sustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of fuelefficient transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices Among the different modes of transportation the use alternative energy cars and widespread instillation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance while the creation of centralized bike and walking paths remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement Access to transportation In order to maintain the aspect of social responsibility inherent within the concept of sustainable cities implementing sustainable transportation must include access to transportation by all levels of society Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation In order to make public transportation more accessible the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city As studies have shown this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime drug use and violence Urban strategic planning Although there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards there is an organization the United Cities and Local Governments UCLG that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa Asia Eurasia Europe Latin America North America Middle East West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate theses experiences to make the best recommendations Additionally the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet and in conferences and workshops An International conference is going to be held in Italy at Università del Salento and Università degli Studi della Basilicata called ‘Green Urbanism’ from 12–14 October 2016 Development Recently local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of urban planning This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses Generally in terms of urban planning the responsibility of local governments are limited to land use and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aides local governments in establishing performance basedmanagement clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level and finally it improves institutional responses and local decision making Additionally it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensusbased solutions establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of the city and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing energy and mobility Obstacles The City Development Strategies CDS addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders The inequality in spatial development and socioeconomic classes paired with concerns of poverty reduction and climate change are factors in achieving global sustainable cities According to the UCLG there are differences between regional and national conditions framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments communities and the private sector to continual to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment Social factors of sustainable cities According to UN Habitat around half of the worlds population is concentrated in cities which is set to rise to 60 within a couple decades The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities demographic change and migration globalisation of the job market poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals segregation spatial patterns and urban growth metropolisation and the rise of urban regions more political power for local authories new actors for developing a city and providing services decline in public funding for development the environment and climate change new and accessible building technologies preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships Examples Australia Melbourne City of Moreland The City of Moreland in Melbournes north has programs for becoming carbon neutral one of which is Zero Carbon Moreland amongst other existing sustainable implementations and proposals City of Melbourne Over the past 10 years various methods of improving public transport have been implemented car free zones and entire streets have also been implemented City of Greater Taree New South Wales The City of Greater Taree North of Sydney has developed a masterplan for Australias first lowtono carbon urban development Adelaide Urban forests In Adelaide South Australia a city of 13 million people Premier Mike Rann 2002 to 2011 launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days Sites include parks reserves transport corridors schools water courses and coastline Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaides greenhouse gas emissions by 600000 tonnes of C02 a year He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss Solar power The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the takeup of solar power In addition to Australias first feedin tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the Museum Art Gallery Parliament Adelaide Airport 200 schools and Australias biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds convention hall which was registered as a power station Wind power South Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power making up 26 of its electricity generation by October 2011 In 5 years to 2011 there was a 15 drop in emissions despite strong economic growth Waste recycling For Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80 by 2011 with 43 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottlecancontainer they return to recycling In 2009 nonreusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled Solid Waste Management in the World Cities Brazil Belo Horizonte Brazil The city was created in 1897 and is the third largest metropolitan in Brazil with 24 million inhabitants The Strategic Plan for Belo Horizonte 2010–2030 is being prepared by external consultants based on similar cities infrastructure incorporating the role of local government state government city leaders and encouraging citizen participation The need for environmental sustainable development is led by the initiative of new government following planning processes from the state government Overall the development of the metropolis is dependent on the land regularization and infrastructure improvement that will better support the cultural technology and economic landscape Cameroon Bafut is a town and traditional kingdom which is working towards becoming an ecocity by 2020 through the Bafut Council Ecocity Project Canada The GreenScore City Index studies the ecologically footprints of Canadian cities and splits them into three population categories Large Medium Small The index studies 50 cities in Canada Vancouver has 2016s highest green score for large cities Burlington has 2016s highest green score

Tianjin The Chinese are working with investment and technology supplied by the Singapore government to build an ecocity in Binhai named the SinoSingapore Tianjin Ecocity Dongtan Ecocity Shanghai The project located in the east of Chongming Island developed by Arup and Parthers was scheduled to accommodate 50000 residents by 2010 but its developer has currently put construction on hold An additional project was made in 2007 in this area an EcoVillage based on the concept made by an Italian professor from the School of Architecture of Tianjin University Huangbaiyu Benxi Liaoning is a small village of 42 homes that has come under great criticism most of the homes are unoccupied by villagers Nanjing As of April 2008 an ecocity collaboration project is being proposed here Rizhao Shandong mandates solar water heaters for households and has been designated the Environmental Model City by Chinas SEPA Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a planned city located just outside

in 2010 The IDA Climate Plan 2050 and 2011 The Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy The studies analysed the benefits and obstacles of running Denmark on 100 renewable energy from year 2050 There is also a larger ambitious plan in action Copenhagen 2025 Climate Plan On a more local level the industrial park in Kalundborg is often cited as a model for industrial ecology However projects have been carried out in several Danish cities promoting 100 renewable energy Examples are Aalborg Ballerup and Frederikshavn Aalborg University has launched a master education on sustainable cities Sustainable Cities Aalborg University Copenhagen See also the Danish Wikipedia Finland The Finnish city of Turku has adopted Carbon Neutral Turku by 2040 strategy to achieve carbon neutrality via

state New capital also coming up with a future sustainable city Ireland South Dublin County Council announced plans in late 2007 to develop Clonburris a new suburb of Dublin to include up to 15000 new homes to be designed to achieve the highest of international standards The plans for Clonburris include countless green innovations such as high levels of energy efficiency mandatory renewable energy for heating and electricity the use of recycled and sustainable building materials a district heating system for distributing heat the provision of allotments for growing food and even the banning of tumble driers with natural drying areas being provided instead In 2012 a energy plan was carried out by the Danish Aalborg University for the municipalities of Limerick and Clare The project was a shortterm 2020 renewable energy strategy giving a 20 reduction in CO2emissions while ensuring that shortterm actions are beneficial to the longterm goal of 100 renewable energy Kenya Hacienda Mombasa

Zone where it is intended that as many as 20 research and development centers will be built focusing on renewable energy and clean technology creating up to 300000 new green jobs The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning FDTCP Peninsular Malaysia is a focal point for the implementation of Malaysian Urban Rural National Indicators Network for Sustainable Development MURNInets MURNInets which include 36 sets of compulsory indicators grouped under 21 themes under 6 dimensions Most of the targets and standards for the selected indicators were adjusted according to hierarchy of local authorities In MURNInets at least 3 main new features are introduced This include the Happiness Index an indicator under the quality of life theme to meet the current development trend that emphasizes on the wellbeing of community Another feature introduced is the customer or people satisfaction level towards local authority’s services It is through the introduction of these indicators the bottomup approach in measuring sustainability is adopted New Zealand The city of Waitakere the Western part of the greater Auckland urban region was New Zealands first ecocity working from the
