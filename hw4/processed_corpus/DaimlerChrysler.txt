Cie founded 1883 by Karl Benz and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft founded 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until on 28 June 1926 when Benz Cie and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG formally merged—becoming DaimlerBenz AG—and agreed that thereafter all of the factories would use the brand name of MercedesBenz on their automobiles In 1998 DaimlerBenz and Chrysler Corporation announced the worlds largest crossborder deal ever valued at US38billion and the resulting change in company name to DaimlerChrysler AG In 2007 when the Chrysler group was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management see below the name of the parent company was changed to simply Daimler AG In November 2014 Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee Timeline of Daimler AG Benz Company 1883–1926 Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft AG 1890–1926 DaimlerBenz AG 1926–1998 DaimlerChrysler AG 1998–2007 Daimler AG 2007–present Merger with Chrysler In a socalled Merger of Equals or Marriage made in Heaven according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E Schrempp DaimlerBenz AG and United Statesbased automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation the smallest of the three American automakers merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as DaimlerBenz AG bought 92 of Chrysler and 8 of Chrysler remained independent and formed DaimlerChrysler AG The terms of the merger allowed DaimlerBenzs nonautomotive businesses such as DaimlerBenz InterServices AG debis AG for short created in 1989 to handle data processing financial and insurance services and real estate management for the Daimler group to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion debis AG reported revenues of 86 bn DM 155 bn in 1997 The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the merger of equals that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a DaimlerBenz takeover of Chrysler A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005 The transaction claimed the job of its architect Chairman Jürgen E Schrempp who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the companys share price following the transaction The merger was also the subject of a book Taken for a Ride How DaimlerBenz Drove Off With Chrysler 2000 by Bill Vlasic and Bradley A Stertz Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses Martin H Wiggers concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group was implemented only for a few models so the synergy effects in development and production were too low As late as 2002 DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines Later that year the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company including the Chrysler Crossfire which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedess 32L V6 and the Dodge SprinterFreightliner Sprinter a rebadged MercedesBenz Sprinter van Sale of Chrysler Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US6 billion Through most of

though behind General Motors and Toyota Chrysler reported losses of US15 billion in 2006 It then announced plans to lay off 13000 employees in midFebruary 2007 close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008 DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007 General Motors was reported to be a suitor but on 3 August 2007 DaimlerChrysler completed the sale of Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 801 percent stake in the new company Chrysler Holding LLC DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 199 stake in the separated Chrysler The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands Of the US74 billion purchase price Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US105 billion in Chryslers financial unit The demerged Daimler AG received US135 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US2 billion in Chrysler itself Since Chryslers 2009 bankruptcy filing in the United States Chrysler has been controlled by Italian automaker Fiat and is as of 2016 still working to integrate Chryslers products into the Fiat portfolio such as Lancia and Chryslers namesake brand and

subsidiaries each plead guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the US Justice Department and the US Securities and Exchange Commission Daimler itself had to pay US185 million as a settlement but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a twoyear deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the twoyear period Additionally Louis J Freeh a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimlers compliance with antibribery laws US prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler Daimler subsidiaries and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some 56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries including China Russia Turkey Hungary Greece Latvia Serbia and Montenegro Egypt and Nigeria among other places that in return awarded the company 19 billion in revenue and at least 914 million in illegal profits The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by MercedesBenz units in South America Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials though the company knew the practice violated US laws In another attempt to silence Bazzetta Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement But Daimlers strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the US criminal investigation for violating antibribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wideranging cases brought against a foreign corporation According to the charges the bribes were frequently made by overinvoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations armored Mercedes vehicles for highranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious dictator of Turkmenistan Turkmenbashi Saparmurat Niyazov including a golden box and 10000 copies of his personal manifesto Ruhnama translated into German Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations OilforFood Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10 of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government then led by Saddam Hussein The SEC said the company made more than 4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt OilforFood deals US prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the US In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to US bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of US shell companies in order to transmit the bribe the court papers said Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a longstanding practice of paying bribes due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice Using offshore bank accounts thirdparty agents and deceptive pricing practices these companies Daimler AG its subsidiaries and affiliates saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business said Mythili Raman a principal deputy in the Justice Departments criminal division It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribepaying at Daimler as a standard business practice Robert Khuzami director of the SECs enforcement division said in a statement We have learned a lot from past experience Dieter Zetsche chairman of Daimlers board said in a statement As per the agreement with prosecutors the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on US stock exchanges Daimler AG was listed with the symbol DAI on the New York Stock Exchange giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car makers payments in countries around the globe Judge Richard J Leon of the United States District Court in Washington DC approved the plea agreement and settlement calling it a just resolution The primary case is USA v Daimler AG United States District Court for the District of Columbia No 110cr00063RJL Notes Press release by Tata Group Jaguar now shares the rights to the Daimler name with Daimler AG the German car manufacturer created when
