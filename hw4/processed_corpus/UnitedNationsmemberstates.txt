 The United Nations member states are the 193 sovereign states that are members of the United Nations UN and have equal representation in the UN General Assembly The UN is the worlds largest intergovernmental organization ahead of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation The criteria for admission of new members to the UN are set out in Chapter II Article 4 of the UN Charter Membership in the United Nations is open to all peaceloving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and in the judgement of the Organization are able and willing to carry out these obligations The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the councils fifteen members with none of the five permanent members using their veto power The Security Councils recommendation must then be approved in the General Assembly by a twothirds majority vote In principle only sovereign states can become UN members and currently all UN members are sovereign states Although five members were not sovereign when they joined the UN all subsequently became fully independent between 1946 and 1991 Because a state can only be admitted to membership in the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly a number of states that are considered sovereign according to the Montevideo Convention are not members of the UN This is because the UN does not consider them to possess sovereignty mainly due to the lack of international recognition or due to opposition from one of the permanent members In addition to the member states the UN also invites nonmember states to become observers at the UN General Assembly currently two the Holy See and Palestine allowing them to participate and speak in General Assembly meetings but not vote Observers are generally intergovernmental organizations and international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty is not precisely defined Original members Further information

founding the seat of China in the UN was held by the Republic of China but as a result of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971 it is now held by the Peoples Republic of China see the section Former members Republic of China Taiwan A number of the original members were not sovereign when they joined the UN and only gained full independence later Belarus then the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and Ukraine then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic were both constituent republics of the Soviet Union until gaining full independence in 1991 India whose territory at that time before the Partition of India also included the presentday territories of Pakistan and Bangladesh was under British colonial rule until gaining full independence in 1947 The Philippines then the Philippine Commonwealth was a commonwealth with the United States until gaining full independence in 1946 New Zealand while de facto sovereign at that time only gained full capacity to enter into relations with other states in 1947 when it passed the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act This occurred 16 years after the British Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster Act in 1931 that recognised New Zealands autonomy If judged by the Montevideo Convention criteria New Zealand did not achieve full de jure statehood until 1947 Current members Further information List of sovereign

member on 24 October 1945 and as set out by the United Nations Charter Chapter V Article 23 became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council In 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War the Kuomintangled ROC government lost effective control of mainland China and relocated to the island of Taiwan and the Communist Partyled government of the Peoples Republic of China PRC declared on 1 October 1949 took control of mainland China The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the Central Peoples Government of the Peoples Republic of China however the Government of the Republic of China continued to represent China at the UN despite the small size of the ROCs jurisdiction of Taiwan and a number of smaller islands compared to the PRCs jurisdiction of mainland China As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN based on the OneChina policy By the 1970s a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count On 25 October 1971 the 21st time the United Nations General Assembly debated on the PRCs admission into the UN United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 was adopted by which it recognized that the representatives of the Government of the Peoples Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations and that the Peoples Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council and decided to restore all its rights to the Peoples Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kaishek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN including its permanent seat on the Security Council from the ROC to the PRC and expelled the ROC from the UN From the United Nations perspective the Republic of China is not a former member No UN member was expelled in 1971 Rather the credentials of one Chinese delegation from Taipei were rejected and the credentials of another Chinese delegation from Beijing were accepted In addition to losing its seat in the UN the UN SecretaryGeneral concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China Consequently the SecretaryGeneral decided that it was not permitted for the ROC to become a party to treaties deposited with it Bids for readmission as the representative of Taiwan Further information Political status of Taiwan and FourStage Theory of the Republic of China In 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the Peoples Republic of China A number of options were considered including seeking membership in the specialized agencies applying for observer status applying for full membership or having resolution 2758 revoked to reclaim the seat of China in the UN Every year from 1993â€“2006 UN member states submitted a memorandum to the UN SecretaryGeneral requesting that the UN General Assembly consider allowing the ROC to resume participating in the United Nations This approach was chosen rather than a formal application for membership because it could be enacted by the General Assembly while a membership application would need Security Council approval where the PRC held a veto Early proposals recommended admitting the ROC with parallel representation over China along with the Peoples Republic of China pending eventual reunification citing examples of other divided countries which had become separate UN member states such as East and West Germany and North and South Korea Later proposals emphasized that the ROC was a separate state over which the PRC had no effective sovereignty These proposed resolutions referred to the ROC under a variety of names Republic of China in Taiwan 1993â€“94 Republic of China on Taiwan 1995â€“97 1999â€“2002 Republic of China 1998 Republic of China Taiwan 2003 and Taiwan 2004â€“06 However all fourteen attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assemblys General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assemblys agenda for debate under strong opposition from the PRC While all these proposals were vague requesting the ROC be allowed to participate in UN activities without specifying any legal mechanism in 2007 the ROC submitted a formal application under the name Taiwan for full membership in the UN However the application was rejected by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs citing General Assembly Resolution 2758 without being forwarded to the Security Council SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations Ban Kimoon stated that The position of the United Nations is that the Peoples Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China The decision until now about the wish of the people in Taiwan to join the United Nations has been decided on that basis The resolution General Assembly Resolution 2758 that you just mentioned is clearly mentioning that the Government of China is the sole and legitimate Government and the position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China Responding to the UNs rejection of its application the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwans representation in the UN it does not prevent Taiwans participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly contrary to UNs standard procedure Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council Chapter X Rule 59 On the other hand the PRC government which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer praised that UNs decision was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly and showed the UN and its member states universal adherence to the oneChina principle A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that falls UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application The following year two referendums in Taiwan on the governments attempts to regain participation at the UN did not pass due to low turnout That fall the ROC took a new approach with its allies submitting a resolution requesting that the Republic of China Taiwan be allowed to have meaningful participation in the UN specialized agencies Again the issue was not put on the Assemblys agenda In 2009 the ROC chose not to bring the issue of its participation in the UN up for debate at the General Assembly for the first time since it began the campaign in 1993 In May 2009 the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the World Health Organization to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name Chinese Taipei This was the ROCs first participation in an event organized by a UNaffiliated agency since 1971 as a result of the improved crossstrait relations since Ma Yingjeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before The Republic of China is officially recognized byÂ 20Â UN member states and the Holy See It maintains unofficial diplomatic relations with many other nations Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945 with its name changed to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 20 April 1990 Upon the imminent dissolution of Czechoslovakia in a letter dated 10 December 1992 its Permanent Representative informed the United Nations SecretaryGeneral that

Serbia and Montenegro was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000 Due to the dispute over its legal successor states the member state Yugoslavia referring to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia remained on the official roster of UN members for many years after its effective dissolution Following the admission of all five states as new UN members Yugoslavia was removed from the official roster of UN members The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia established on 28 April 1992 by the remaining Yugoslav republics of Montenegro and Serbia claimed itself as the legal successor state of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia however on 30 May 1992 United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 was adopted by which it imposed international sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its role in the Yugoslav Wars and noted that the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro to continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted and on 22 September 1992 United Nations General Assembly Resolution ARES471 was adopted by which it considered that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations and therefore decided that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the

than Articles 5 and 6 On 25 October 1971 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 was adopted which recognized the Peoples Republic of China instead of the Republic of China since 1949 controlling only Taiwan as the legitimate representative of China in the UN and effectively expelled the Republic of China from the UN in 1971 see the section Former members Republic of China This act did not constitute as the expulsion of a member state under Article 6 as this would have required Security Council approval and been subjected to vetoes by its permanent members which included the Republic of China itself and the United States which at that time still recognized the Republic of China In October 1974 the Security Council considered a draft resolution that would have recommended that the General Assembly immediately expel South Africa from the UN in compliance with Article 6 of the United Nations Charter due to its apartheid policies However the resolution was not adopted because of vetoes by three permanent members of the Security Council France the United Kingdom and the United States In response the General Assembly decided to suspend South Africa from participation in the work of the Assemblys 29th session on 12 November 1974 however South Africa was not formally suspended under Article 5 The suspension lasted until the General Assembly welcomed South Africa back to full participation in the UN on 23 June 1994 following its successful democratic elections earlier that year On 28 April 1992 the new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was established by the

1965â€“1966 Main article CONEFO Since the inception of the UN only one member state excluding those that dissolved or merged with other member states has unilaterally withdrawn from the UN During the Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia confrontation and in response to the election of Malaysia as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council in a letter dated 20 January 1965 Indonesia informed the United Nations SecretaryGeneral that it had decided at this stage and under the present circumstances to withdraw from the UN However following the overthrow of President Sukarno in a telegram dated 19 September 1966 Indonesia notified the SecretaryGeneral of its decision to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twentyfirst session of the General Assembly On 28 September 1966 the United Nations General Assembly took note of the decision of the Government of Indonesia and the President invited the representatives of that country to take their seats in the Assembly Unlike suspension and expulsion no express provision is made in the United Nations Charter of whether or how a member can legally withdraw from the UN largely to prevent the threat of withdrawal from being used as a form of political blackmail or to evade obligations under the Charter similar to withdrawals that weakened the UNs predecessor the League of Nations or on whether a request for readmission by a withdrawn member should be treated the same as an application for membership ie requiring Security Council as well as General Assembly approval Indonesias return to the UN would suggest that this is not required however scholars have argued that the course of action taken by the General Assembly was not in accordance with the Charter
