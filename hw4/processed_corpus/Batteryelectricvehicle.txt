 For electric vehicles other than battery powered vehicles see electric vehicle For passenger electric vehicles see electric car For the batteries themselves see electric vehicle battery A battery electric vehicle BEV batteryonly electric vehicle BOEV or allelectric vehicle is a type of electric vehicle EV that uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines ICEs for propulsion They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine fuel cell or fuel tank BEVs include bicycles scooters skateboards rail cars watercraft forklifts buses trucks and cars Cumulative global sales of highwaycapable lightduty pure electric vehicles passed the one million unit milestone in September 2016 As of December 2016 the worlds top selling highway legal allelectric car in history is the Nissan Leaf with global sales of over 250000 units followed by the Tesla Model S with more than 158000 units delivered worldwide Terminology See also Hybrid electric vehicle Plugin hybrid and Plugin electric vehicle Vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of hybrid electric vehicles and are not considered pure or allelectric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged operate in chargesustaining mode and instead they are continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking Hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and gasoline fuel are called plugin hybrid electric vehicles PHEV and run as BEVs during their chargedepleting mode PHEVs with a series powertrain are also called rangeextended electric vehicles REEVs such as the Chevrolet Volt and Fisker Karma Plugin electric vehicles PEVs are a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles BEVs plugin hybrid vehicles PHEVs and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles In China plugin electric vehicles together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles NEVs However in the United States neighborhood electric vehicles NEVs are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour 72 kmh are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour 48 kmh and have a maximum loaded weight of 3000 lbs Vehicles by type The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged batteries on board vehicles for propulsion Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology Lithium Ion that have higher power and energy density ie greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries and higher oil prices BEVs include automobiles light trucks and neighborhood electric vehicles Rail

3100000 kilometres 1900000 mi They were made locally by Advanced Vehicle Systems Two of these buses were used for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta Beginning in the summer of 2000 Hong Kong Airport began operating a 16passenger Mitsubishi Rosa electric shuttle bus and in the fall of 2000 New York City began testing a 66passenger batterypowered school bus an allelectric version of the Blue Bird TC2000 A similar bus was operated in Napa Valley California for 14 months ending in April 2004 The 2008 Beijing Olympics used a fleet of 50 electric buses which have a range of 130 km 81 mi with the air conditioning on They use Lithiumion batteries and consume about 1 kW·hmi 062 kW·hkm 22 MJkm The buses were designed by the Beijing Institute of Technology and built by the Jinghua Coach Co Ltd The batteries are replaced with fully charged ones at the recharging station to allow 24hour operation of the buses In France the bus electric phenomenon is in development but some buses are already operating in numerous cities PVI a medium company located in the Paris region is one of the leader of the market with its brand Gepebus offering Oreos 2X and Oreos 4X In the United States the first batteryelectric fastcharge bus has been in operation in Pomona California since September 2010 at Foothill Transit The Proterra EcoRide BE35 uses lithiumtitanate batteries and is able to fastcharge in less than 10 minutes In 2014 the first production model allelectric school bus was delivered to the Kings Canyon Unified School District in California’s San Joaquin Valley The bus was one of four the district ordered This battery electric school bus which has 4 sodium nickel batteries is the first modern electric school bus approved for student transportation by any state The same technology is used to power the Mountain View Community Shuttles This technology was supported by the California Energy Commission and the shuttle program is being supported by Google Thunder Sky Thunder Sky based in Hong Kong builds lithiumion batteries used in submarines and has three models of electric buses the 1021 passenger EV6700 with a range of 280 km 170 mi under 20 mins quickcharge the EV2009 city buses and the 43 passenger EV2008 highway bus which has a range of 300 km 190 mi under quickcharge 20 mins to 80 percent and 350 km 220 mi under full charge 25 mins The buses will also be built in the United States and Finland Free Tindo Tindo is an allelectric bus from Adelaide Australia The Tindo aboriginal word for sun is made by Designline International in New Zealand and gets its electricity from a solar PV system on Adelaides central bus station Rides are zerofare as part of Adelaides public transport system First FastCharge BatteryElectric Transit Bus Proterras EcoRide BE35 transit bus called the Ecoliner by Foothill Transit in West Covina California is a heavy duty fast charge batteryelectric bus Proterras ProDrive drivesystem uses a UQM motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the TerraVolt energy storage system which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31–35 percent It can travel 30–40 miles on a single charge is up to 600 percent more fuelefficient than a typical diesel or CNG bus and produces 44 percent less carbon than CNG Electric trucks Main article Electric truck For most of the 20th century the majority of the worlds battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats Electric vans In March 2012 Smith Electric Vehicles announced the release of the Newton StepVan an allelectric zeroemission vehicle built on the versatile Newton platform that features a walkin body produced by Indianabased Utilimaster Electric cars Main article Electric car See also List of production battery electric vehicles and electric car use by country An electric car is a plugin battery powered automobile which is propelled by electric motors Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbonbased fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges Recharging can also take significant lengths of time For journeys within a single battery charge rather than long journeys electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight Electric cars have the potential of significantly reducing city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions Vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated With the current US energy mix using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions Given the current energy mixes in other countries it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40 percent in the UK 19 percent in China and as little as 1 percent in Germany Electric cars are expected to have a major impact in the auto industry given advantages in city pollution less dependence on oil and expected rise in gasoline prices World governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components The US has pledged US24 billion in federal grants for electric cars and batteries China has announced it will provide US15 billion to initiate an electric car industry Cumulative global sales of highwaycapable battery electric cars and vans passed the 1 million unit milestone in September 2016 The RenaultNissan
