 Alternative energy is any energy source that is an alternative to fossil fuel These alternatives are intended to address concerns about such fossil fuels such as its high carbon dioxide emissions an important factor in global warming Marine energy hydroelectric wind geothermal and solar power are all alternative sources of energy The nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has changed considerably over time as have controversies regarding energy use Because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates defining some energy types as alternative is considered very controversial Definitions History Historians of economies have examined the key transitions to alternative energies and regard the transitions as pivotal in bringing about significant economic change Prior to the shift to an alternative energy supplies of the dominant energy type became erratic accompanied by rapid increases in energy prices Coal as an alternative to wood In the late medieval period coal was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel wood The deforestation had resulted in shortage of wood at that time soft coal appeared as a savior Historian Norman F Cantor describes how Petroleum as an alternative to whale oil Whale oil was the dominant form of lubrication and fuel for lamps in the early 19th century but the depletion of the whale stocks by mid century caused whale oil prices to skyrocket setting the stage for the adoption of petroleum which was first commercialized in Pennsylvania in 1859 Ethanol as an alternative to fossil fuels Main article Ethanol fuel In 1917 Alexander Graham Bell advocated ethanol from corn wheat and other foods as an alternative to coal and oil stating that the world was in measurable distance of depleting these fuels For Bell the problem requiring an alternative was lack of renewability of orthodox energy sources Since the 1970s Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the worlds second largest producer of ethanol after the United States and the worlds largest exporter Brazil’s ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugar cane as feedstock and the residual canewaste bagasse is used to process heat and power There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline By the end of 2008 there were 35000 filling stations throughout Brazil with at least one ethanol pump Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks and involves the use of the whole crop This new approach should increase yields and reduce the carbon footprint because the amount of energyintensive fertilizers and fungicides will remain the same for a higher output of usable material As of 2008 there are nine commercial cellulosic ethanol plants which are either operating or under construction in the United States Secondgeneration biofuels technologies are able to manufacture biofuels from inedible biomass and could hence prevent conversion of food into fuel As of July 2010 there is one commercial secondgeneration 2G ethanol plant Inbicon Biomass Refinery which is operating in Denmark Coal gasification as an alternative to petroleum In the 1970s President Jimmy Carters administration advocated coal gasification as an alternative to expensive imported oil The program including the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s The carbon footprint and environmental impact of coal gasification are both very high Common types of alternative energy Hydro electricity captures energy from falling water Nuclear energy uses nuclear fission to release energy stored in the atomic bonds of heavy elements Wind energy is the generation of electricity from wind commonly by using propellerlike turbines Solar energy is the use of sunlight Light can be changed into thermal heat energy or directly into electricity via photovoltaic devices Geothermal energy is the use of the earths internal heat to boil water for heating buildings or generating electricity Biofuel and Ethanol are plantderived gasoline substitutes for powering vehicles Hydrogen can be used as a carrier of energy produced by various technologies such as cracking of hydrocarbons or water electrolysis Enabling technologies Ice storage air conditioning and thermal storage heaters are methods of shifting consumption to use low cost offpeak electricity When compared to resistance heating heat pumps conserve electrical power or in rare cases mechanical or thermal power by collecting heat from a cool source such as a body of water the ground or the air Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from diurnal to interseasonal and can involve storage of sensible energy ie by changing the temperature of a medium or latent energy eg through phase changes of a medium ie changes from solid to liquid or vice versa such as between water and slush or ice Energy sources can be natural via solarthermal collectors or dry cooling towers used to collect winters cold waste energy such as from HVAC equipment industrial processes or power plants or surplus energy such as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms The Drake Landing Solar Community Alberta Canada is illustrative Borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get 97 of its yearround heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs The storages can be insulated tanks borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock deep aquifers or shallow pits that are lined and insulated Some applications require inclusion of a heat pump Renewable energy vs nonrenewable energy Main article Renewable energy Renewable energy is generated from natural resources—such as sunlight wind rain tides and geothermal heat—which are renewable naturally replenished When comparing the processes for producing energy there remain several fundamental differences between renewable energy and fossil fuels The process of producing oil coal or natural gas fuel is a difficult and demanding process that requires a great deal of complex equipment physical and chemical processes On the other hand alternative energy can be widely produced with basic equipment and natural processes Wood the most renewable and available alternative fuel emits the same amount of carbon when burned as would be emittted if it degraded naturally Nuclear power is an alternative to fossil fuels that is nonrenewable like fossil fuels nuclear ones are a finite resource Ecologically friendly alternatives A renewable energy source such as biomass is sometimes regarded as a good alternative to providing heat and electricity with fossil fuels Biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose while burning biomass is carbonneutral air pollution is still produced For example the Netherlands once leader in use of palm oil as a biofuel has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels The Netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner Regarding biofuels from foodstuffs the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the US would only produce 16 of its auto fuel needs and the decimation of Brazils CO2 absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy Recently alternatives to such undesirable sustainable fuels are being sought such as commercially viable sources of cellulosic ethanol Relatively new concepts for alternative energy Carbonneutral and negative fuels Main articles Carbonneutral fuel and Methanol economy Carbonneutral fuels are synthetic fuels including methane gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel or ammonia produced by hydrogenating waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant fluegas emissions recovered from automotive exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce synthetic fuels for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than 55 per barrel Renewable methanol RM is a fuel produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide by catalytic hydrogenation where the hydrogen has been obtained from water electrolysis It can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock The George Olah carbon dioxide recycling plant operated by Carbon Recycling International in Grindavík Iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the Svartsengi Power Station since 2011 It has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year A 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research ZSW at BadenWürttemberg and the Fraunhofer Society in Germany and began operating in 2010 It is being upgraded to 10 megawatts scheduled for completion in autumn 2012 Audi has constructed a carbonneutral liquefied natural gas LNG plant in Werlte Germany The plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset LNG used in their A3 Sportback gtron automobiles and can keep 2800 metric tons of CO2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity Other commercial developments are taking place in Columbia South Carolina Camarillo California and Darlington England Such fuels are considered carbonneutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases To the extent that synthetic fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation Such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles Carbonneutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy storage alleviating the problems of wind and solar intermittency and they enable distribution of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines Nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day so the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative Germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts Algae fuel Algae fuel is a biofuel which is derived from algae During photosynthesis algae and other photosynthetic organisms capture carbon dioxide and sunlight and convert it into oxygen and biomass This is usually done by placing the algae between two panes of glass The algae creates three forms of energy fuel heat from its growth cycle biofuel the natural oil derived from the algae and biomass from the algae itself as it is harvested upon maturity The heat can be used to power building systems such as heat process water or to produce energy Biofuel is oil extracted from the algae upon maturity and used to create energy similar to the use of biodiesel The biomass is the matter left over after extracting the oil and water and can be harvested to produce combustible methane for energy production similar to the warmth felt in a compost pile or the methane collected from biodegradable materials in a landfill Additionally the benefits of algae biofuel are that it can be produced industrially as well as vertically ie as a building facade thereby obviating the use of arable land and food crops such as soy palm and canola Biomass briquettes Biomass briquettes are being developed in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal The technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70 the calorific value of charcoal There are relatively few examples of large scale briquette production One exception is in North Kivu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to Mountain Gorilla habitat The staff of Virunga National Park have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict affected areas Biogas digestion Biogas digestion deals with harnessing the methane gas that is released when waste breaks down This gas can be retrieved from garbage or sewage systems Biogas digesters are used to process methane gas by having bacteria break down biomass in an anaerobic environment The methane gas that is collected and refined can be used as an energy source for various products Biological hydrogen production Hydrogen gas is a completely clean burning fuel its only byproduct is water It also contains relatively high amount of energy compared with other fuels due to its chemical structure 2H2 O2 → 2H2O High Energy High Energy 2H2O → 2H2 O2 This requires a highenergy input making commercial hydrogen very inefficient Use of a biological vector as a means to split water and therefore produce hydrogen gas would allow for the only energy input to be solar radiation Biological vectors can include bacteria or more commonly algae This process is known as biological hydrogen production It requires the use of single celled organisms to create hydrogen gas through fermentation Without the presence of oxygen also known as an anaerobic environment regular cellular respiration cannot take place and a process known as fermentation takes over A major byproduct of this process is hydrogen gas If this could be implemented on a large scale then sunlight nutrients and water could create hydrogen gas to be used as a dense source of energy Largescale production has proven difficult Not until 1999 was it even possible to induce these anaerobic conditions by sulfur deprivation Since the fermentation process is an evolutionary back up turned on during stress the cells would die after a few days In 2000 a twostage process was developed to take the cells in and out of anaerobic conditions and therefore keep them alive For the last ten years finding a way to do this on a largescale has been the main goal of research Careful work is being done to ensure an efficient process before largescale production however once a mechanism is developed this type of production could solve our energy needs Hydroelectricity Main article Hydroelectricity Hydroelectricity provided 75 of the worlds renewable electricity in 2013 Much of the electricity used today is a result of the heyday of conventional hydroelectric development between 1960 and 1980 which has virtually ceased in Europe and North America due to environmental concerns Globally there is a trend towards more hydroelectricity From 2004 to 2014 the installed capacity rose from 715 to 1055 GW A popular alternative to the large dams of the past is runoftheriver where there is no water stored behind a dam and generation usually varies with seasonal rainfall Using runoftheriver in wet seasons and solar in dry seasons can balance seasonal variations for both Another move away from large dams is small hydro these tend to be situated high up on tributaries rather than on main rivers in valley bottoms Offshore wind Offshore wind farms are similar to landbased wind farms but are located on the ocean Offshore wind farms can be placed in water up to 40 metres 130 ft deep whereas floating wind turbines can float in water up to 700 metres 2300 ft deep The advantage of having a floating wind farm is to be able to harness the winds from the open ocean Without any obstructions such as hills trees and buildings winds from the open ocean can reach up to speeds twice as fast as coastal areas Significant generation of offshore wind energy already contributes to electricity needs in Europe and Asia and now the first offshore wind farms are under development in US waters While the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades especially in Europe there is still uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment Traditional offshore wind turbines are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the nearshore marine environment As offshore wind technologies become more advanced floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist Marine and hydrokinetic energy Marine and Hydrokinetic MHK or marine energy development includes projects using the following devices Wave power is the transport of energy by wind waves and the capture of that energy to do useful work – for example electricity generation or pumping water into reservoirs A machine able to exploit significant waves in open coastal areas is generally known as a wave energy converter Tidal power turbines are placed in coastal and estuarine areas and daily flows are quite predictable Instream turbines in fastmoving rivers Ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents Ocean Thermal Energy Converters in deep tropical waters Nuclear power In the year 2015 ten new reactors came online and 67 more were under construction including the first eight new Generation III AP1000 reactors in the US and China and the first four new Generation III EPR reactors in Finland France and China Reactors are also under construction in Belarus Brazil India Iran Japan Pakistan Russia Slovakia South Korea Turkey Ukraine and United Arab Emirates Thorium nuclear power Main article Thorium fuel cycle For more details on power production see see Thoriumbased nuclear power Thorium is a fissionable material for possible future use in a Thoriumbased reactor Proponents of thorium reactors claims several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle such as thoriums greater abundance better resistance to nuclear weapons proliferation and reduced plutonium and actinide production Thorium reactors can be modified to produce Uranium233 which can then be processed into highly enriched uranium which has been tested in low yield weapons and is unproven on a commercial scale Investing in alternative energy As an emerging economic sector there are limited stock market investment opportunities in alternative energy available to the general public The public can buy shares of alternative energy companies from various stock markets with wildly volatile returns The recent IPO of SolarCity demonstrates the nascent nature of this sector within a few weeks it already had achieved the second highest market cap within the alternative energy sector Investors can also choose to invest in ETFs exchangetraded funds that track an alternative energy index such as the WilderHill New Energy Index Additionally there are a number of mutual funds such as Calverts Global Alternative Energy Mutual Fund that are a bit more proactive in choosing the selected investments Recently Mosaic Inc launched an online platform allowing residents of California and New York to invest directly in solar Investing in solar projects had previously been limited to accredited investors or a small number of willing banks Over the last three years publicly traded alternative energy companies have been very volatile with some 2007 returns in excess of 100 some 2008 returns down 90 or more and peaktotrough returns in 2009 again over 100 In general there are three subsegments of “alternative” energy investment solar energy wind energy and hybrid electric vehicles Alternative energy sources which are renewable and have lower carbon emissions than fossil fuels are hydropower wind energy solar energy geothermal energy and bio fuels Each of these four segments involve very different technologies and investment concerns For example photovoltaic solar energy is based on semiconductor processing and accordingly benefits from steep cost reductions similar to those realized in the microprocessor industry ie driven by larger scale higher module efficiency and improving processing technologies PV solar energy is perhaps the only energy technology whose electricity generation cost could be reduced by half or more over the next 5 years Better and more efficient manufacturing process and new technology such as advanced thin film solar cell is a good example of that helps to reduce industry cost The economics of solar PV electricity are highly dependent on silicon pricing and even companies whose technologies are based on other materials eg First Solar are impacted by the balance of supply and demand in the silicon market In addition because some companies sell completed solar cells on the open market eg QCells this creates a low barrier to entry for companies that want to manufacture solar modules which in turn can create an irrational pricing environment In contrast because wind power has been harnessed for over 100 years its underlying technology is relatively stable Its economics are largely determined by siting eg how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements and the prices of steel the largest component of a wind turbine and select composites used for the blades Because current wind turbines are often in excess of 100 meters high logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage These issues and others were explored in a research report by Sanford Bernstein Alternative energy in transportation Due to steadily rising gas prices in 2008 with the US national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas rising above 400 at one point there has been a steady movement towards developing higher fuel efficiency and more alternative fuel vehicles for consumers In response many smaller companies have rapidly increased research and development into radically different ways of powering consumer vehicles Hybrid and battery electric vehicles are commercially available and are gaining wider industry and consumer acceptance worldwide For example Nissan USA introduced the worlds first massproduction Electric Vehicle Nissan Leaf A plugin hybrid car the Chevrolet Volt also has been produced using an electric motor to drive the wheels and a small fourcylinder engine to generate additional electricity Making alternative energy mainstream Before alternative energy becomes mainstream there are a few crucial obstacles that it must overcome First there must be increased understanding of how alternative energies are beneficial secondly the availability components for these systems must increase and lastly the payback period must be decreased For example electric vehicles EV and Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles PHEV are on the rise These vehicles depend on investment in home and public charging infrastructure as well as implementing much more alternative energy for future transportation Research There are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of alternative energy This research spans several areas of focus across the alternative energy spectrum Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields In the US multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on alternative energy in recent years Two of the most prominent of these labs are Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL both of which are funded by the United States Department of Energy and supported by various corporate partners Sandia has a total budget of 24 billion while NREL has a budget of 375 million Mechanical Energy Mechanical energy associated with human activities such as blood circulation respiration walking typing and running etc is ubiquitous but usually wasted It has attracted tremendous attention from researchers around the globe to find methods to scavenge such mechanical energies The best solution currently is to use piezoelecric materials which can generate flow of electrons when deformed Various devices using piezoelectric materials have been built to scavenge mechanical energy Considering that the piezoelectric constant of the material plays a critical role in the overall performance of a piezoelectric device one critical research direction to improve device efficiency is to find new material of large piezoelectric response Lead Magnesium NiobateLead Titanate PMNPT is a nextgeneration piezoelectric material with super high piezoelectric constant when ideal composition and orientation are obtained In 2012 PMNPT Nanowires with a very high piezoelectric constant were fabricated by a hydrothermal approach and then assembled into an energyharvesting device The recordhigh piezoelectric constant was further improved by the fabrication of a singlecrystal PMNPT nanobelt which was then used as the essential building block for a piezoelectric nanogenerator Solar Main article Solar energy Solar energy can be used for heating cooling or electrical power generation using the sun Solar heat has long been employed in passively and actively heated buildings as well as district heating systems Examples of the latter are the Drake Landing Solar Community is Alberta Canada and numerous district systems in Denmark and Germany In Europe there are two programs for the application of solar heat the Solar District Heating SDH and the International Energy Agencys Solar Heating and Cooling SHC program The obstacles preventing the large scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology and the cost Currently photovoltaic PV panels only have the ability to convert around 16 of the sunlight that hits them into electricity Both Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL have heavily funded solar research programs The NREL solar program has a budget of around 75 million and develops research projects in the areas of photovoltaic PV technology solar thermal energy and solar radiation The budget for Sandia’s solar division is unknown however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory’s 24 billion budget Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years The Solar Energy Research Center SERC at University of North Carolina UNC has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology In 2008 researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining In February 2012 North Carolinabased Semprius Inc a solar development company backed by German corporation Siemens announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel The company claims that the prototype converts 339 of the sunlight that hits it to electricity more than double the previous highend conversion rate Wind Main article Wind Energy Wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when NASA developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds Today both Sandia National Laboratories and National Renewable Energy Laboratory have programs dedicated to wind research Sandia’s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials aerodynamics and sensors The NREL wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production reducing their capital costs and making wind energy more cost effective overall The Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy FLOWE at Caltech was established to research alternative approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost size and environmental impact of wind energy production Renewable energies such as wind solar biomass and geothermal combined supplied 13 of global final energy consumption in 2013 Biomass Main articles Biomass and Biogas Biomass can be regarded as biological material derived from living or recently living organisms It most often refers to plants or plantderived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass As an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal chemical and biochemical methods Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today examples include forest residues such as dead trees branches and tree stumps yard clippings wood chips and even municipal solid waste In the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals including biofuels Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including miscanthus switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow sorghum sugarcane bamboo and a variety of tree species ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm palm oil Biomass biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heatpower and in doing so harm the environment Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides SOx nitrous oxides NOx and particulate matter PM are produced from this combustion The World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution and biomass combustion is a major contributor of it The use of biomas is carbon neutral over time but is otherwise similar to burning fossil fuels Ethanol biofuels Main article Ethanol biofuels As the primary source of biofuels in North America many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production On the Federal level the USDA conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol Cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn basedethanol It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood grasses or nonedible parts of plants Moreover some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than cornbased ethanol Sandia National Laboratories conducts inhouse cellulosic ethanol research and is also a member of the Joint BioEnergy Institute JBEI a research institute founded by the United States Department of Energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels Other biofuels Main article Biofuel From 1978 to 1996 the National Renewable Energy Laboratory experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the Aquatic Species Program” A selfpublished article by Michael Briggs at the University of New Hampshire Biofuels Group offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50 which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants This oilrich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate In addition to its projected high yield algaculture— unlike food cropbased biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha curcas a poisonous shrublike tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha through advancements in genetics soil science and horticultural practices SG Biofuels a San Diegobased Jatropha developer has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of Jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming CfSEF is a Los Angelesbased nonprofit research organization dedicated to Jatropha research in the areas of plant science agronomy and horticulture Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase Jatropha farm production yields by 200300 in the next ten years Geothermal Main article Geothermal electricity Geothermal energy is produced by tapping into the heat within the earths crust It is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished However the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability Several entities such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy The International Centre for Geothermal Research IGC a German geosciences research organization is largely focused on geothermal energy development research Hydrogen Main article Hydrogen fuel Over 1 billion has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the United States Both the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories have departments dedicated to hydrogen research Much of this work centers on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technologies Disadvantages Further information Renewable energy debate Disadvantages of hydroelectricity Tidal power § Tidal power issues and Issues relating to biofuels The generation of alternative energy on the scale needed to replace fossil energy in an effort to reverse global climate change is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts For example biomass energy generation would have to increase 7fold to supply current primary energy demand and up to 40fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections Humans already appropriate 30 to 40 of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources The total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the United States each year is around 58 quads 615 EJ about half of which is already harvested as agricultural crops and forest products The remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity Since annual energy use in the United States is ca 100 quads biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction To supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10 of the Earth’s land surface which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture ie ca 1500 million hectares indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict given current world hunger statistics over growing plants for biofuel versus food Given environmental concerns eg fish migration destruction of sensitive aquatic ecosystems etc about building new dams to capture hydroelectric energy further expansion of conventional hydropower in the United States is unlikely Windpower if deployed on the large scale necessary to substitute fossil energy is likely to face public resistance If 100 of US energy demand were to be supplied by windmills about 80 million hectares ie more than 40 of all available farmland in the United States would have to be covered with large windmills 50m hub height and 250 to 500 m apart It is therefore not surprising that the major environmental impact of wind power is related to land use and less to wildlife birds bats etc mortality Unless only a relatively small fraction of electricity is generated by windmills in remote locations it is unlikely that the public will tolerate large windfarms given concerns about blade noise and aesthetics Biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to net greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution Burning produces airborne carbon particulates carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides Setbacks Renewable alternative forms of energy have faced opposition from multiple groups including conservatives and liberals Around twelve states have passed proposals written to inhibit the alternative energy movement Kansas lawmakers struck down a bill to phase out renewable energy mandates but face the possibility of the bill reappearing The opposition cites the potentially high cost of branching out to these alternatives in order to support the continuation and reliance on fossil fuels Ohios mandate to phase in alternative energy faces opposition who believe higher electricity prices will result while supporters fear the loss of economic development and jobs that alternative energy could bring With nuclear meltdowns in Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power presents a constant danger and is more unlikely to be a useful alternative source The costs of maintaining nuclear facilities the potential risk of meltdowns and the cost of cleaning up meltdowns are cited as reasons behind the movement away from the use of nuclear energy Nuclear power plants cannot compete with fossil fuels currently due to the latters lower price and availability Nuclear power plants also face competition from the increasing renewable energy market Renewable energy does have some setbacks when relying on them completely Spikes in electricity bills occurred in Southern Australia when wind was not powering the turbines responsible for a large portion of the regions power This led to the government to reintegrate a gaspowered station to supply power while the wind turbines were unable to Solar energy is the fastest growing and one of the most renowned form of alternative energy today Solar panels are an icon of the green power movement however the process of manufacturing the quartz based panels can be detrimental to the environment Raw quartz silica is used to create solar cells must be mined using harsh chemicals that harm the surrounding environment as well as those working in the mines Silicosis is a form of lung disease that is caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust resulting in nodule lesions in the lungs The silica must be cultivated into metallurgicalgrade silicon the process requiring a massive amount of energy as the quartz is placed into furnaces heated with fossil fuels The metallurgical grade silica must be processed into polysilicon This process also produces tetrachloride a toxic substance that if not disposed of correctly can be harmful to the surrounding environment Hydrochloric acid is formed when tetrachloride interacts with water raising water and soil pH Incidents of tetrachloride spills are common in China as the production of solar panels has shifted from Europe and the United States to Asian countries within the early 2000s Because of such the villagers of Gaolong are unable to leave their homes due to air and soil becoming toxic This was due to Luoyang Zhongui HighTechnology Co repeatedly dumped tetrachloride in a nearby field for almost a year See also Sustainable energy Lowcarbon power Alternative
