 Not to be confused with Carbon capture and utilization Carbon capture and storage CCS or carbon capture and sequestration is the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide CO2 from large point sources such as fossil fuel power plants transporting it to a storage site and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere normally an underground geological formation The aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuel use in power generation and other industries It is a potential means of mitigating the contribution of fossil fuel emissions to global warming and ocean acidification Although CO2 has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes including enhanced oil recovery the long term storage of CO2 is a relatively new concept The first commercial example was the WeyburnMidale Carbon Dioxide Project in 2000 Other examples include SaskPowers Boundary Dam and Mississippi Powers Kemper Project CCS can also be used to describe the scrubbing of CO2 from ambient air as a climate engineering technique An integrated pilotscale CCS power plant was to begin operating in September 2008 in the eastern German power plant Schwarze Pumpe run by utility Vattenfall to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80–90 compared to a plant without CCS The IPCC estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10 and 55 of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100 Carbon dioxide can be captured out of air or fossil fuel power plant flue gas using adsorption or carbon scrubbing membrane gas separation or adsorption technologies Amines are the leading carbon scrubbing technology Capturing and compressing CO2 may increase the energy needs of a coalfired CCS plant by 25–40 These and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost per watt energy produced by 21–91 for fossil fuel power plants Applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive especially if they are far from a sequestration site A 2005 industry report suggests that with successful research development and deployment RDD sequestered coalbased electricity generation in 2025 may cost less than unsequestered coalbased electricity generation today Storage of the CO2 is envisaged either in deep geological formations or in the form of mineral carbonates Deep ocean storage is not currently considered feasible due to the associated effect of ocean acidification Geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites The National Energy Technology Laboratory NETL reported that North America has enough storage capacity for more than 900 years worth of carbon dioxide at current production rates A general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain and there is still the risk that CO2 might leak into the atmosphere Capture Main articles Carbon dioxide scrubber carbon dioxide air capture Clean coal Amine gas treating Membrane gas separation and Metalorganic framework Capturing CO2 is most effective at point sources such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities industries with major CO2 emissions natural gas processing synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuelbased hydrogen production plants Extracting CO2 from air is also possible but not very practical because the CO2 is not concentrated Organisms that produce ethanol by fermentation generate cool essentially pure CO2 that can be pumped underground Fermentation produces slightly less CO2 than ethanol by weight Flue gas from the combustion of coal in oxygen has a large concentration of CO2 about 1015 CO2 whereas natural gas power plant flue gas is about 5–10 CO2 Therefore it is more energy and cost efficient to capture CO2 from coalfired power plants Impurities in CO2 streams like sulfurs and water could have a significant effect on their phase behaviour and could pose a significant threat of increased corrosion of pipeline and well materials10 In instances where CO2 impurities exist especially with air capture a scrubbing separation process would be needed to initially clean the flue gas According to the Wallula Energy Resource Center in Washington state by gasifying coal it is possible to capture approximately 65 of carbon dioxide embedded in it and sequester it in a solid form Broadly three different configurations of technologies for capture exist postcombustion precombustion and oxyfuel combustion In post combustion capture the CO2 is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel — this is the scheme that would be applied to fossilfuel burning power plants Here carbon dioxide is captured from flue gases at power stations or other large point sources The technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications although not at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station Post combustion capture is most popular in research because existing fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include CCS technology in this configuration The technology for precombustion is widely applied in fertilizer chemical gaseous fuel H2 CH4 and power production In these cases the fossil fuel is partially oxidized for instance in a gasifier The resulting syngas CO and H2 is shifted into CO2 and H2 The resulting CO2 can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream The H2 can now be used as fuel the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture The CO2 is removed after combustion of fossil fuels but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants or to existing plants where repowering is an option The capture before expansion ie from pressurized gas is standard in almost all industrial CO2 capture processes at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants In oxyfuel combustion the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour the latter of which is condensed through cooling The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as zero emission cycles because the CO2 stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream as in the cases of pre and postcombustion capture but the flue gas stream itself A certain fraction of the CO2 generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water To warrant the label zero emission the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately The technique is promising but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy CO2 separation technologies Carbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with absorption adsorption or membrane gas separation technologies Absorption or carbon scrubbing with amines is currently the dominant capture technology Membrane and adsorption technologies are still in the developmental research stages initiating primary pilot plants in the near future MetalOrganic Frameworks MOFs are a novel class of materials that offer promise for carbon capture using adsorption technologies Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through physisorption or chemisorption based on the porosity and selectivity of the MOF leaving behind a Greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption TSA or pressure swing adsorption PSA so the MOF can be reused Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the CO2 is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused Monoethanolamine MEA solutions the leading amine for capturing CO2 have a heat capacity between 34 Jg K since they are mostly water Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step Thus to optimize a MOF for carbon capture low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired Additionally high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much CO2 as possible from the flue gas However there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure As the amount of CO2 captured increases the energy and therefore cost required to regenerate increases A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs Capture is attributed to about two thirds of the total cost of CCS making it limit the widescale deployment of CCS technologies To optimize a CO2 capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of CCS since the transport and storage steps of CCS are rather mature technologies An alternate method under development is chemical looping combustion CLC Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier Metal oxide particles react with a solid liquid or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed combustor producing solid metal particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor The water vapor is condensed leaving pure carbon dioxide which can then be sequestered The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor A variant of chemical looping is calcium looping which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a calcium oxide based carrier as a means of capturing CO2 A few engineering proposals have been made for the more difficult task of removing CO2 from the atmosphere – a form of climate engineering – but work in this area is still in its infancy Capture costs are estimated to be higher than from point sources but may be feasible for dealing with emissions from diffuse sources such as automobiles and aircraft The theoretically required energy for air capture is only slightly more than for capture from point sources The additional costs come from the devices that use the natural air flow Global Research Technologies demonstrated a preprototype of air capture technology in 2007 Transport After capture the CO2 would have to be transported to suitable storage sites This would most likely be done by pipeline which is generally the cheapest form of transport In 2008 there were approximately 5800 km of CO2 pipelines in the United States used to transport CO2 to oil production fields where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil The injection of CO2 to produce oil is generally called Enhanced Oil Recovery or EOR In addition there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the longterm storage of CO2 in nonoil producing geologic formations According to the Congressional Research Service There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements economic regulation utility cost recovery regulatory classification of CO2 itself and pipeline safety Furthermore because CO2 pipelines for enhanced oil recovery are already in use today policy decisions affecting CO2 pipelines take on an urgency that is unrecognized by many Federal classification of CO2 as both a commodity by the Bureau of Land Management and as a pollutant by the Environmental Protection Agency could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with CO2 pipeline operations today Ships could also be utilized for transport where pipelines are not feasible These methods are currently used for transporting CO2 for other applications Sequestration Main article Carbon sequestration Various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of CO2 These forms include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations including saline formations and exhausted gas fields and solid storage by reaction of CO2 with metal oxides to produce stable carbonates Geological storage Also known as geosequestration this method involves injecting carbon dioxide generally in supercritical form directly into underground geological formations Oil fields gas fields saline formations unmineable coal seams and salinefilled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites Various physical eg highly impermeable caprock and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the CO2 from escaping to the surface CO2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to increase oil recovery Approximately 30 to 50 million metric tonnes of CO2 are injected annually in the United States into declining oil fields This option is attractive because the geology of hydrocarbon reservoirs is generally well understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered Disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited capacity as well as the fact that subsequent burning of the additional oil recovered will offset much or all of the reduction in CO2 emissions Unmineable coal seams can be used to store CO2 because the CO2 molecules attach to the surface of coal The technical feasibility however depends on the permeability of the coal bed In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed methane and the methane can be recovered enhanced coal bed methane recovery The sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the CO2 storage Burning the resultant methane however would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original CO2 Saline formations contain highly mineralized brines and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans Saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them especially compared to oil fields To keep the cost of storage acceptable the geophysical exploration may be limited resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds no side product will offset the storage cost Leakage of CO2 back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline aquifer storage Current research shows however that trapping mechanisms such as structural trapping residual trapping solubility trapping and mineral trapping could immobilize the CO2 underground and reduce the risk of leakage Enhanced oil recovery Enhanced oil recovery EOR is a generic term for techniques used to increase the amount of crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field In Carbon Capture Sequestration Enhanced Oil Recovery CCS EOR carbon dioxide is injected into an oil field to recover oil that is often never recovered using more traditional methods Crude oil development and production in US oil reservoirs can include up to three distinct phases primary secondary and tertiary or enhanced recovery During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoirs original oil in place is typically produced Secondary recovery techniques extend a fields productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place However with much of the easytoproduce oil already recovered from US oil fields producers have attempted several tertiary or enhanced oil recovery EOR techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent or more of the reservoirs original oil in place An example of a project that will use CCS EOR is the Kemper Project in Mississippi Due to the Kemper Projects close proximity to oil fields the carbon dioxide byproduct from producing electricity will be transported to the neighboring oil fields for EOR Ocean storage In the past it was suggested that CO2 could be stored in the oceans but this would only exacerbate ocean acidification and has been made illegal under specific regulations Ocean storage is no longer considered feasible Mineral storage In this process CO2 is exothermically reacted with available metal oxides which in turn produces stable carbonates eg calcite magnesite This process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for a great amount of surface limestone The idea of using olivine has been promoted by the geochemist Prof Schuiling The reaction rate can be made faster for example with a catalyst or by reacting at higher temperatures andor pressures or by pretreatment of the minerals although this method can require additional energy The IPCC estimates that a power plant equipped with CCS using mineral storage will need 60–180 more energy than a power plant without CCS The economics of mineral carbonation at scale are now being tested in a worldfirst pilot plant project based in Newcastle Australia New techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the GreenMag Group and the University of Newcastle and funded by the New South Wales and Australian Governments to be operational by 2013 In 2009 it was reported that scientists had mapped 6000 square miles 16000 km of rock formations in the US that could be used to store 500 years worth of US carbon dioxide emissions A study on mineral sequestration in the US states Carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring Mg and Ca containing minerals with CO2 to form carbonates has many unique advantages Most notable is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than CO2 which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally eg the weathering of rock over geologic time periods Secondly the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant Finally the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus rerelease of CO2 into the atmosphere is not an issue However conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures The significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics The following table lists principal metal oxides of Earths Crust Theoretically up to 22 of this mineral mass is able to form carbonates Ultramafic mine tailings are a readily available source of finegrained metal oxides that can act as artificial carbon sinks to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the mining industry Accelerating passive CO2 sequestration via mineral carbonation may be achieved through microbial processes that enhance mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation Energy requirements The energy requirements of sequestration processes may be significant In one paper sequestration consumed 25 percent of the plants rated 600megawatt output capacity Leakage A major concern with CCS is whether leakage of stored CO2 will compromise CCS as a climate change mitigation option For wellselected designed and managed geological storage sites IPCC estimates that risks are comparable to those associated with current hydrocarbon activity However this finding is contested due to a lack of experience in such long term storage CO2 could be trapped for millions of years and although some leakage occurs upwards through the soil well selected storage sites are likely to retain over 99 of the injected CO2 over 1000 years Leakage through the injection pipe is a greater risk Although the injection pipe is usually protected with nonreturn valves to prevent release on a power outage there is still a risk that the pipe itself could tear and leak due to the pressure The Berkel en Rodenrijs incident in December 2008 was an example where a modest release of CO2 from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there In order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage the implementation of CO2 alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed Malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released CO2 and 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road A release of CO2 from a salt mine killed a person at distance of 300 meters In 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered CO2 rose from Lake Nyos in Cameroon and asphyxiated 1700 people While the carbon had been sequestered naturally some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially The Lake Nyos disaster resulted from a volcanic event which very suddenly released as much as a cubic kilometre of CO2 gas from a pool of naturally occurring CO2 under the lake in a deep narrow valley The location of this pool of CO2 is not a place where man can inject or store CO2 and this pool was not known about nor monitored until after the occurrence of the natural disaster For ocean storage the retention of CO2 would depend on the depth The IPCC estimates 30–85 of the sequestered carbon dioxide would be retained after 500 years for depths 1000–3000 m Mineral storage is not regarded as having any risks of leakage The IPCC recommends that limits be set to the amount of leakage that can take place This might rule out deep ocean storage as an option At the conditions of the deeper oceans about 400 bar or 40 MPa 280 K water–CO2l mixing is very low where carbonate formationacidification is the rate limiting step but the formation of waterCO2 hydrates a kind of solid water cage that surrounds the CO2 is favorable To further investigate the safety of CO2 sequestration Norways Sleipner gas field can be studied as it is the oldest plant that stores CO2 on an industrial scale According to an environmental assessment of the gas field which was conducted after ten years of operation the author affirmed that geosequestration of CO2 was the most definite form of permanent geological storage of CO2 Available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the Utsira formation saline reservoir This implies that the geological environment is tectonically stable and a site suitable for carbon dioxide storage The solubility trapping is the most permanent and secure form of geological storage In March 2009 StatoilHydro issued a study showing the slow spread of CO2 in the formation after more than 10 years operation Phase I of the WeyburnMidale Carbon Dioxide Project in Weyburn Saskatchewan Canada has determined that the likelihood of stored CO2 release is less than one percent in 5000 years A January 2011 report however claimed evidence of leakage in land above that project This report was strongly refuted by the IEAGHG WeyburnMidale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project which issued an eightpage analysis of the study claiming that it showed no evidence of leakage from the reservoir The liability of potential leaks is one of the largest barriers to largescale CCS To assess and reduce such liability the leakage of stored gasses particularly carbon dioxide into the atmosphere may be detected via atmospheric gas monitoring and can be quantified directly via the eddy covariance flux measurements Monitoring geological sequestration sites In order to detect carbon dioxide leaks and the effectiveness of geological sequestration sites different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as cap and trade policies evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released should a leak occur or to closely watch stored CO2 there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels Subsurface monitoring In subsurface monitoring there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of CO2 in the reservoir A direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample This drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock It also only provides data at a specific location Indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted This approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region it does however lack precision Both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously Seismic monitoring Seismic monitoring is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring It is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a vibroseis truck or inside a well using spinning eccentric mass These vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers It can identify migration pathways of the CO2 plume Two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the Sleipner sequestration project and the Frio CO2 Injection test Although this method can confirm the presence of CO2 in a given region it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of CO2 Surface monitoring Eddy covariance is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of CO2 from the grounds surface It involves measuring CO2 concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer This provides a measure of the total vertical flux of CO2 Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks however the natural carbon cycle such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants would have to be accounted for and a baseline CO2 cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the Shallow Release test Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer This also measures the vertical flux of CO2 The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting CO2 leaks over the entire sequestration site InSAR monitoring InSAR monitoring is another type of surface monitoring It involves a satellite sending signals down to the Earths surface where it is reflected back to the satellites receiver From this the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point In CCS the injection of CO2 in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures These high pressured fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape In areas of stored CO2 the grounds surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers These changes in elevation of the Earths surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the inSAR satellite which is then detectable and measurable Carbon dioxide recycling carbon capture and utilization CCU Main article Carbon neutral fuel Recycling CO2 may offer a response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary industrial emitters in the near to medium term but is usually considered a different technological category from CCS Technologies under development such as Bio CCS Algal Synthesis utilises presmokestack CO2 such as from a coalfired power station as a useful feedstock input to the production of oilrich algae in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel including aviation fuel and nutritious stockfeed for farm animal production The CO2 and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes containing waste water and select strains of algae causing together with sunlight or UV light an oil rich biomass that doubles in mass every 24 hours The Bio CCS Algal Synthesis process is based on earth science photosynthesis the technology is entirely retrofittable and collocated with the emitter and the capital outlays may offer a return upon investment due to the high value commodities produced oil for plastics fuel and feed Bio CCS Algal Synthesis test facilities were being trialed at Australias three largest coalfired power stations Tarong Queensland Eraring NSW Loy Yang Victoria using piped preemission smokestack CO2 and other greenhouse gases as feedstock to grow oilrich algal biomass in enclosed membranes for the production of plastics transport fuel and nutritious animal feed Another potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of CO2 is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics There are a number of projects investigating this possibility Carbon dioxide scrubbing variants exist based on potassium carbonate which can be used to create liquid fuels though this process requires a great deal of energy input Although the creation of fuel from atmospheric CO2 is not a climate engineering technique nor does it actually function as greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide will be rereleased when the fuel is burned it nevertheless is potentially useful in the creation of a low carbon economy Other uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates eg olivine produces Magnesium carbonate This process is still in the RD phase Single step methods methanol A proven process to produce a hydrocarbon is to make methanol Methanol is easily synthesized from CO2 and H2 Based on this fact the idea of a methanol economy was born Single step methods hydrocarbons At the department of Industrial Chemistry and Engineering of Materials at the University of Messina Italy there is a project to develop a system which works like a fuelcell in reverse whereby a catalyst is used that enables sunlight to split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas The ions cross a membrane where they react with the CO2 to create hydrocarbons Two step methods If CO2 is heated to 2400 °C it splits into carbon monoxide CO and oxygen The FischerTropsch process can then be used to convert the CO into hydrocarbons The required temperature can be achieved by using a chamber containing a mirror to focus sunlight on the gas Rival teams are developing such chambers at Solarec and at Sandia National Laboratories both based in New Mexico According to Sandia these chambers could provide enough fuel to power 100 of domestic vehicles using 5800 km unlike biofuels this would not take fertile land away from crops but would be land that is not being used for anything else James May the British TV presenter visited a demonstration plant in a programme in his Big Ideas series Example CCS projects Industrialscale projects As of September 2012 the Global CCS Institute identified 75 largescale integrated projects in its 2012 Global Status of CCS report which is a net increase of one project since its 2011 Global Status of CCS report 16 of these projects are in operation or in construction capturing around 36 million tonnes of CO2 per annum For more information see Integrated CCS Projects on the Global CCS Institutes website For information on EU projects see Zero Emissions Platform website The eight largescale integrated CCS projects currently in operation are In Salah CO2 Injection — Algeria In Salah is a fully operational onshore gas field with CO2 injection CO2 is separated from produced gas and reinjected in the producing hydrocarbon reservoir zones Since 2004 about 1 Mta of CO2 has been captured during natural gas extraction and injected into the Krechba geologic formation at a depth of 1800m The Krechba formation is expected to store 17Mt CO2 over the life of the project Injection suspended in 2011 due to concerns about the integrity of the seal Sleipner CO2 Injection — Norway Main article Sleipner gas field Sleipner is a fully operational offshore gas field with CO2 injection initiated in 1996 CO2 is separated from produced gas and reinjected in the Utsira saline aquifer 800–1000 m below ocean floor above the hydrocarbon reservoir zones This aquifer extends much further north from the Sleipner facility at its southern extreme The large size of the reservoir accounts for why 600 billion tonnes of CO2 are expected to be stored long after the Sleipner natural gas project has ended Snøhvit CO2 Injection — Norway Snøhvit is a fully operational offshore gas field with CO2 injection The LNG plant is located onshore CO2 is necessarily separated to produce liquefied natural gas LNG and then CO2 is injected in a saline aquifer below the hydrocarbon reservoir zones offshore at a rate of 700000 ta into the Tubåen sandstone formation 2600 m under the seabed for storage This formation was closed April 2011 and injection started in the Støformation where produced gas is taken Produced CO2 is increasing therefore separation capacity may limit production before end 2015 when a new formation will be drilled for CO2injection only Teknisk Ukeblad nr 30 2013 tuno Great Plains Synfuel Plant and WeyburnMidale Project — Canada WeyburnMidale is a coal gasification operation that produces synthetic natural gas and various petrochemicals from coal This project

Texas hydrocarbon gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure that provides CO2 for use in EOR With a total CO2 capture capacity of 85 Mta expected in 2012 the Century plant would be the largest single industrial source CO2 capture facility in North America Duke Energy East Bend Station — US Researchers at the Center for Applied Energy Research of the University of Kentucky are currently developing the algaemediated conversion of coalfired power plant flue gas to dropin hydrocarbon fuels Through their work these researchers have proven that the carbon dioxide within flue gas from coalfired power plants can be captured using algae which can be subsequently harvested and utilized eg as a feedstock for the production of dropin hydrocarbon fuels Canada The federal government in the 2008 and 2009 budgets has invested approximately 14 billion in Carbon Capture and Storage development Alberta Alberta has committed 170 million in 20132014 – and a total of 13 billion over 15 years – to fund two largescale CCS projects that will help reduce CO2 emissions from tar sands refining In 2010 a grant agreement was signed with the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line The second is the Quest Project The Quest project uses amine absorption to capture CO2 from the Scotford Steam Methane Reformer units Approximately 12 Mtonne CO2 per year is captured and transported through 64 km of onshore pipeline into a saline aquifer in the Cambrian Basal Sands British Columbia Spectra Energys Fort Nelson Project is proposed but still needs to secure funding The total project cost is estimated to be US 125 Million The source of CO2 will be from the Fort Nelson Natural Gas Processing Plant and will be transported 15 km via an onshore pipeline to middle Devonian carbonate rock that is between 6500 and 7000 feet deep The process will capture 22 Megatonne CO2 per year using an amine process in its precombustion capture Injections and MVA Operations have already occurred 2014 and is projected to startup in 2018 Saskatchewan Led by the provinces fullservice utility SaskPower one of the worlds first and largest full production carbon capture facilities is operating at Boundary Dam Power Station With an initial investment of 15 to 16 billion SaskPower will be generating a revenue by selling a portion of the captured CO2 back into the market to be used for enhanced oil recovery The project started in May 2011 and became operational in October 2014 The postcombustion full flue gas capture process will capture 1 million tonnes of CO2 a year Pilot projects The Alberta Saline Aquifer

IPAC CO2 and the Canadian Clean Power Coalition Netherlands In the Netherlands a 68megawatt oxyfuel plant Zero Emission Power Plant was being planned to be operational in 2009 This project was later canceled ROAD Rotterdam Capture and Storage Demonstration project is a joint project by EON Benelux and Electrabel Nederland GDF SUEZ Group Every year starting in 2015 ROAD will capture around 11 million tonnes of CO2 at the new power plant on the Maasvlakte This will be stored in depleted gas reservoirs under the North Sea Developed in the Netherlands an electrocatalysis by a copper complex helps reduce carbon dioxide to oxalic acid Norway In Norway the CO2 Technology Centre TCM at Mongstad began construction in 2009 and completed in 2012 It includes two capture technology plants one advanced amine and one chilled ammonia both capturing fluegas from two sources This includes a gasfired power plant and refinery cracker fluegas similar to coalfired power plant fluegas In addition to this the Mongstad site was also planned to have a fullscale CCS demonstration plant The project was delayed to 2014 2018 and then indefinitely The project cost rose to USD 985 million Then in October 2011 Aker Solutions wrote off its investment in Aker Clean Carbon declaring the carbon sequestration market to be dead On 1 October 2013 Norway asked Gassnova not to sign any contracts for Carbon capture and storage outside Mongstad Poland In Belchatów Poland a lignitefired energy plant of more than 858 MW is planned to be in operation in 2013 United States In November 2008 the DOE awarded a 669 million eightyear grant to a research partnership headed by Montana State University to demonstrate that underground geologic formations can store huge volumes of carbon dioxide economically safely and permanently Researchers under the Big Sky Regional Carbon Sequestration Project plan to inject up to one million tonnes of CO2 into sandstone beneath southwestern Wyoming In the United States four different synthetic fuel projects are moving forward which have publicly announced plans to incorporate carbon capture and storage American Clean Coal Fuels in their Illinois Clean Fuels ICF project is developing a 30000barrel 4800 m per day biomass and coal to liquids project in Oakland Illinois which will market the CO2 created at the plant for enhanced oil recovery applications By combining sequestration and biomass feedstocks the ICF project will achieve dramatic reductions in the lifecycle carbon footprint of the fuels they produce If sufficient biomass is used the plant should have the capability to go lifecycle carbon negative meaning that effectively for each gallon of their fuel that is used carbon is pulled out of the air and put into the ground Baard Energy in their Ohio River Clean Fuels project is developing a 53000 bbld 8400 md coal and biomass to liquids project which has announced plans to market the plants CO2 for enhanced oil recovery Rentech is developing a 29600barrel 4710 m per day coal and biomass to liquids plant in Natchez Mississippi which will market the plants CO2 for enhanced oil recovery The first phase of the project is expected in 2011 DKRW is developing a 15000–20000barrel 2400–3200 m per day coal to liquids plant in Medicine Bow Wyoming which will market its plants CO2 for enhanced oil recovery The project is expected to begin operation in 2013 In October 2009 the US Department of Energy awarded grants to twelve Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage ICCS projects to conduct a Phase 1 feasibility study The DOE plans to select 3 to 4 of those projects to proceed into Phase 2 design and construction with operational startup to occur by 2015 Battelle Memorial Institute Pacific Northwest Division Boise Inc and Fluor Corporation are studying a CCS system for capture and storage of CO2 emissions associated with the pulp and paper production industry The site of the study is the Boise White Paper LLC paper mill located near the township of Wallula in Southeastern Washington State The plant generates approximately 12 MMT of CO2 annually from a set of three recovery boilers that are mainly fired with black liquor a recycled byproduct formed during the pulping of wood for papermaking Fluor Corporation will design a customized version of their Econamine Plus carbon capture technology The Fluor system also will be designed to remove residual quantities of remnant air pollutants from stack gases as part of the CO2 capture process Battelle is leading preparation of an Environmental Information Volume EIV for the entire project including geologic storage of the captured CO2 in deep flood basalt formations that exist in the greater region The EIV will describe the necessary site characterization work sequestration system infrastructure and monitoring program to support permanent sequestration of the CO2 captured at the plant In addition to individual carbon capture and sequestration projects there are a number of US programs designed to research develop and deploy CCS technologies on a broad scale These include the National Energy Technology Laboratorys NETL Carbon Sequestration Program regional carbon sequestration partnerships and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum CSLF SECARB In October 2007 the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin received a 10year 38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored longterm project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of CO2 for underground storage The project is a research program of the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership SECARB funded by the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the US Department of Energy DOE The SECARB partnership will demonstrate CO2 injection rate and storage capacity in the TuscaloosaWoodbine geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida The region has the potential to store more than 200 billion tons of CO2 from major point sources in the region equal to about 33 years of overall US emissions at present rates Beginning in fall 2007 the project will inject CO2 at the rate of one million tons per year for up to 15 years into brine up to 10000 feet 3000 m below the land surface near the Cranfield oil field which lays about 15 miles 24 km east of Natchez Mississippi Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain CO2 Kemper Project The Kemper Project is an electrical generating station currently under construction in Kemper County Mississippi Mississippi Power a subsidiary of Southern Company began construction of the plant in 2010 The project is central to President Obamas Climate Plan Once operational the Kemper Project will be a firstofitskind electricity plant to employ gasification and carbon capture technologies at this scale However there have been project management problems The power plant construction has been delayed and is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2016 more than two years behind schedule at a cost of 66 billion—three times original cost estimate According to a Sierra Club analysis Kemper is the most expensive power plant ever built for the watts of electricity it will generate Texas Clean Energy Project The Texas Clean Energy Project TCEP is a NowGen Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle IGCC facility that will incorporate carbon capture utilization and storage CCUS technology in a firstofitskind commercial clean coal power plant This project is expected to be operational in 2018 It will be the first USbased power plant to combine both IGCC and capture 90 of its emissions Big Brown Steam Electric Station Examples of carbon sequestration at an existing US coal plant can be found at utility company Luminants pilot version at its Big Brown Steam Electric Station in Fairfield Texas This system is converting carbon from smokestacks into baking soda Skyonic plans to circumvent storage problems of liquid CO2 by storing baking soda in mines landfills to be sold as industrial or food grade baking soda Green Fuel Technologies is piloting and implementing algae based carbon capture circumventing storage issues by then converting algae into fuel or feed though this may lead to rerelease of the carbon United Kingdom The government of the United Kingdom launched a first tender process for a CCS demonstration project in 2007 The project were to use postcombustion technology on coalfired power generation at 300–400 megawatts or equivalent The project aimed to be operational by 2014 The Government announced in June 2008 that four companies had prequalified for the competition BP Alternative Energy International Limited EON UK Plc Peel Power Limited and Scottish Power Generation Limited BP subsequently withdrew from the competition claiming it could not find a power generator partner and RWE npower sought a judicial review of the process after it did not qualify This first CCS tender was cancelled in late 2011 when government could not reach agreement with the ScottishPowerShellNational Grid consortium on terms and cost for the project based on retrofitting the existing Longannet coalfired power station in Scotland A second tender process was launched by government in 2012 as part of DECCs CCS Commercialisation Programme and two bidders namely the Shell Peterhead gasfired power station CCS project and the White Rose CCS project based upon a new oxyfuel coalfired unit at Drax power station were selected in 2013 to proceed to a funded frontend engineering and design phase This second tender was cancelled in November 2015 following a government spending review at the time of the Chancellors Autumn Statement Doosan Babcock has modified their Clean Combustion Test Facility CCTF in Renfrew Scotland to create the largest Oxyfuel test facility currently in the world Oxyfuel firing on pulverized coal with recycled flue gas demonstrates the operation of a full scale 40 MW burner for use in coalfired boilers Sponsors of the project include the UK Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform BERR as well as a group of industrial sponsors and university partners comprising Scottish and Southern Energy Prime Sponsor EON UK PLC Drax Power Limited ScottishPower EDF Energy Dong Energy Generation Air Products Plc Sponsors and Imperial College and University of Nottingham University Partners In 2009 UK firm 2Co Energy was awarded planning permission for a £5bn power station and carboncaptureandstorage project at Hatfield near Doncaster and £164m of EU funding Technology company Samsung agreed to take a 15 stake in the project It is planned to construct a 60 km 37 mi pipeline from Stainforth near Hatfield in South Yorkshire to Barmston in the East Riding of Yorkshire CO2 would then be stored in natural porous rock beneath the North Sea National Grid believes the project has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from power stations across Yorkshire and the Humber by up to 90 and both the proposed White Rose CCS project at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire and the proposed Don Valley Power Project at Hatfield could benefit from the scheme In the Northeast of England The Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster NEPIC of commodity chemical manufacturers are amongst the largest single point producers of carbon dioxide in the United Kingdom and they have created within NEPIC the Process Industry Carbon Capture and Storage Initiative PICCSI to study the possibility of a carbon capture and storage CCS solution being provided for the chemical and steel manufacturing industry on Teesside as well as for any carbon based energy production This CCS technology option is being considered as a result of climate change regulations and the carbon taxation that could become a prohibitive cost for such energy intensive industries The Crown Estate is responsible for storage rights on the UK continental shelf and it has facilitated work on offshore carbon dioxide storage technical and commercial issues China In Beijing as of 2009 one major power plant is capturing and reselling a small fraction of its CO2 emissions Germany The German industrial area of Schwarze Pumpe about 4 kilometres 25 mi south of the city of Spremberg is home to the worlds first demonstration CCS coal plant the Schwarze Pumpe power station The mini pilot plant is run by an Alstombuilt oxyfuel boiler and is also equipped with a flue gas cleaning facility to remove fly ash and sulphur dioxide The Swedish company Vattenfall AB invested some €70 million in the twoyear project which began operation September 9 2008 The power plant which is rated at 30 megawatts is a pilot project to serve as a prototype for future fullscale power plants 240 tonnes a day of CO2 are being trucked 350 kilometers 220 mi where it will be injected into an empty gas field Germanys BUND group called it a fig leaf For each tonne of coal burned 36 tonnes of carbon dioxide is produced The CCS program at Schwarze Pumpe ended in 2014 due to inviable costs and energy use German utility RWE operates a pilotscale CO2 scrubber at the lignitefired Niederaußem power station built in cooperation with BASF supplier of detergent and Linde engineering In Jänschwalde Germany a plan is in the works for an Oxyfuel boiler rated at 650 thermal MW around 250 electric MW which is about 20 times more than Vattenfalls 30 MW pilot plant under construction and compares to todays largest Oxyfuel test rigs of 05 MW Postcombustion capture technology will also be demonstrated at Jänschwalde Australia Main article Carbon capture and storage in Australia The Federal Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson opened the first geosequestration project in the southern hemisphere in April 2008 The demonstration plant is near Nirranda South in South Western Victoria 35°19′S 149°08′E﻿ ﻿3531°S 14914°E﻿ 3531 14914 The plant is owned by the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies CO2CRC CO2CRC is a non profit research collaboration supported by government and industry The project has stored and monitored over 65000 tonnes of carbon dioxiderich gas which was extracted from a natural gas reservoir via a well compressed and piped 225 km to a new well There the gas has been injected into a depleted natural gas reservoir approximately two kilometers below the surface The project has moved to a second stage and is investigating carbon dioxide trapping in a saline aquifer 1500 meters below the surface The Otway Project is a research and demonstration project focused on comprehensive monitoring and verification This plant does not propose to capture CO2 from coalfired power generation though two CO2CRC demonstration projects at a Victorian power station and research gasifier are demonstrating solvent membrane and adsorbent capture technologies from coal combustion Currently only smallscale projects are storing CO2 stripped from the products of combustion of coal burnt for electricity generation at coalfired power stations Work currently being carried out by the GreenMag Group and the University of Newcastle and funded by the New South Wales and Australian Governments and industry intends to have a working mineral carbonation pilot plant in operation by 2013 View the full list of Zero Emission Projects for fossil fuel power plant in Europe Limitations of CCS for power stations Critics say largescale CCS deployment is unproven and decades away from being commercialized They say that it is risky and expensive and that a better option is renewable energy Some environmental groups point out that CCS technology leaves behind dangerous waste material that has to be stored just like nuclear power stations Another limitation of CCS is its energy penalty The technology is expected to use between 10 and 40 percent of the energy produced by a power station Widescale adoption of CCS may erase efficiency gains in coal power plants of the last 50 years and increase resource consumption by one third Even taking the fuel penalty into account however overall levels of CO2 abatement would remain high at approximately 80–90 compared to a plant without CCS It is possible for CCS when combined with biomass to result in net negative emissions Though all of the currently as of Feb 2011 operational BECCS Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage plants operate on point emissions other than power stations such as biofuel refineries The use of CCS can reduce CO2 emissions from the stacks of coal power plants by 85–90 or more but it has no effect on CO2 emissions due to the mining and transport of coal It will actually increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological landuse airpollution and waterpollution impacts from coal mining transport and processing because the CCS system requires 25 more energy thus 25 more coal combustion than does a system without CCS Another concern regards the permanence of storage schemes Opponents to CCS claim that safe and permanent storage of CO2 cannot be guaranteed and that even very low leakage rates could undermine any climate mitigation effect In 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered CO2 rose from Lake Nyos in Cameroon and asphyxiated 1700 people While the carbon had been sequestered naturally some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially On one hand Greenpeace claims that CCS could lead to a doubling of coal plant costs It is also claimed by opponents to CCS that money spent on CCS will divert investments away from other solutions to climate change On the other hand CCS is pointed out as economically attractive in comparison to other forms of low carbon electricity generation and seen by the IPCC and others as a critical component for meeting mitigation targets such as 450 ppm and 350 ppm Cost Although the processes involved in CCS have been demonstrated in other industrial applications no commercial scale projects which integrate these processes exist the costs therefore are somewhat uncertain Some recent credible estimates indicate that the cost of capturing and storing carbon dioxide is US60 per ton corresponding to an increase in electricity prices of about US 6c per kWh based on typical coalfired power plant emissions of 097 kg 213 lb CO2 per kWh This would double the typical US industrial electricity price now at around 6c per kWh and increase the typical retail residential electricity price by about 50 assuming 100 of power is from coal which may not necessarily be the case as this varies from state to state Similar approximate price increases would likely be expected in coal dependent countries such as Australia because the capture technology and chemistry as well as the transport and injection costs from such power plants would not in an overall sense vary significantly from country to country The reasons that CCS is expected to cause such power price increases are several Firstly the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing CO2 significantly raises the operating costs of CCSequipped power plants In addition there are added investment and capital costs The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 25 for a coalfired plant and about 15 for a gasfired plant The cost of this extra fuel as well as storage and other system costs are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30–60 depending on the specific circumstances Precommercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology the total additional costs of an early largescale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0511 billion per project over the project lifetime Other applications are possible In the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage Walker Architects published the first CO2 gas CAES application proposing the use of sequestered CO2 for Energy Storage on October 24 2008 To date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined The cost of CCS depends on the cost of capture and storage which varies according to the method used Geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost US050–800 per tonne of CO2 injected plus an additional US010–030 for monitoring costs When storage is combined with enhanced oil recovery to extract extra oil from an oil field however the storage could yield net benefits of US10–16 per tonne of CO2 injected based on 2003 oil prices This would likely negate some of the effect of the carbon capture when the oil was burnt as fuel Even taking this into account as the table above shows the benefits do not outweigh the extra costs of capture Cost of electricity generated by different sources including those incorporating CCS technologies can be found in cost of electricity by source If CO2 capture was part of a fuel cycle then the CO2 would have value rather than be a cost The proposed Solar Fuel or methane cycle proposed by the Fraunhofer Society amongst others is an example This solar fuel cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water The hydrogen is then combined with CO2 to create synthetic natural gas SNG and stored in the gas network See the latest Cost Report on the Cost of CO2 Capture produced by the Zero Emissions Platform Governments around the world have provided a range of different types of funding support to CCS demonstration projects including tax credits allocations and grants The funding is associated with both a desire to accelerate innovation activities for CCS as a lowcarbon technology and the need for economic stimulus activities As of 2011 approximately US235bn has been made available to support largescale CCS demonstration projects around the world Carbon capture and storage and the Kyoto Protocol One way to finance future CCS projects could be through the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol At COP16 in 2010 The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice at its thirtythird session issued a draft document recommending the inclusion of Carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations in Clean Development Mechanism project activities At COP17 in Durban a final agreement was reached enabling CCS projects to receive support through the Clean Development Mechanism Environmental effects The theoretical merit of CCS systems is the reduction of CO2 emissions by up to 90 depending on plant type Generally environmental effects from use of CCS arise during power production CO2 capture transport and storage Issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections Additional energy is required for CO2 capture and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power depending on the plant type For new supercritical pulverized coal PC plants using current technology the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40 while for natural gas combined cycle NGCC plants the range is 11–22 and for coalbased gasification combined cycle IGCC systems it is 14–25 IPCC 2005 Obviously fuel use and environmental problems arising from mining and extraction of coal or gas increase accordingly Plants equipped with fluegas desulfurization FGD systems for sulfur dioxide control require proportionally greater amounts of limestone and systems equipped with selective catalytic reduction systems for nitrogen oxides produced during combustion require proportionally greater amounts of ammonia IPCC has provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs see table below While CO2 is drastically reduced though never completely captured emissions of air pollutants increase significantly generally due to the energy penalty of capture Hence the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology CO2 is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic CO2 at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing CO2 at higher temperatures in a desorber Chilled Ammonia CCS Plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air Functionalized Ammonia emit less ammonia but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx Nevertheless there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine and consecutive nitrosamine emissions Nevertheless all the capture plants amines have in common that practically 100 of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas the same applies to dustash See also
