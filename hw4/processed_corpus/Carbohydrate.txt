 A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon C hydrogen H and oxygen O atoms usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 21 as in water in other words with the empirical formula CmH2On where m could be different from n This formula holds true for monosaccharides Some exceptions exist for example deoxyribose a sugar component of DNA has the empirical formula C5H10O4 Carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones The term is most common in biochemistry where it is a synonym of saccharide a group that includes sugars starch and cellulose The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups monosaccharides disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides Monosaccharides and disaccharides the smallest lower molecular weight carbohydrates are commonly referred to as sugars The word saccharide comes from the Greek word σάκχαρον sákkharon meaning sugar While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix ose For example grape sugar is the monosaccharide glucose cane sugar is the disaccharide sucrose and milk sugar is the disaccharide lactose Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms Polysaccharides serve for the storage of energy eg starch and glycogen and as structural components eg cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods The 5carbon monosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes eg ATP FAD and NAD and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system fertilization preventing pathogenesis blood clotting and development In food science and in many informal contexts the term carbohydrate often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch such as cereals bread and pasta or simple carbohydrates such as sugar found in candy jams and desserts Often in lists of nutritional information such as the USDA National Nutrient Database the term carbohydrate or carbohydrate by difference is used for everything other than water protein fat ash and ethanol This will include chemical compounds such as acetic or lactic acid which are not normally considered carbohydrates It also includes dietary fiber which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute much in the way of food energy calories even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as though it were a sugar Carbohydrates are found in wide variety of foods The important sources are cereals wheat maize rice potatoes sugarcane fruits table sugarsucrose bread milk etc Starch and sugar are the important carbohydrates in our diet Starch is abundant in potatoes maize rice and other cereals Sugar appears in our diet mainly as sucrosetable sugar which is added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam biscuits and cakes Glucose and fructose are found naturally in many fruits and some vegetables Glycogen is carbohydrate found in the liver and muscles as animal source Cellulose in the cell wall of all plant tissue is a carbohydrate It is important in our diet as fibre which helps to maintain a healthy digestive system Structure Formerly the name carbohydrate was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula Cm H2On Following this definition some chemists considered formaldehyde CH2O to be the simplest carbohydrate while others claimed that title for glycolaldehyde Today the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula For example while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this For example carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as Nacetyl eg chitin sulphate eg glycosaminoglycans carboxylic acid eg sialic acid and deoxy modifications eg fucose and sialic acid Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides with general formula CH2On where n is three or more A typical monosaccharide has the structure H–CHOHxCO–CHOHy–H that is an aldehyde or ketone with many hydroxyl groups added usually one on each carbon atom that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone functional group Examples of monosaccharides are glucose fructose and glyceraldehydes However some biological substances commonly called monosaccharides do not conform to this formula eg uronic acids and deoxysugars such as fucose and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides eg formaldehyde CH2O and inositol CH2O6 The openchain form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a closed ring form where the aldehydeketone carbonyl group carbon CO and hydroxyl group –OH react forming a hemiacetal with a new C–O–C bridge Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called polysaccharides or oligosaccharides in a large variety of ways Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed For example deoxyribose a component of DNA is a modified version of ribose chitin is composed of repeating units of Nacetyl glucosamine a nitrogencontaining form of glucose Division Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes ketones alcohols acids their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type They may be classified according to their degree of polymerization and may be divided initially into three principal groups namely sugars oligosaccharides and polysaccharides DP Degree of polymerization Monosaccharides Main article Monosaccharide Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be hydrolyzed to smaller carbohydrates They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups The general chemical formula of an unmodified monosaccharide is C•H2On literally a carbon hydrate Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids The smallest monosaccharides for which n3 are dihydroxyacetone and D and Lglyceraldehydes Classification of monosaccharides Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics the placement of its carbonyl group the number of carbon atoms it contains and its chiral handedness If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde the monosaccharide is an aldose if the carbonyl group is a ketone the monosaccharide is a ketose Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses those with four are called tetroses five are called pentoses six are hexoses and so on These two systems of classification are often combined For example glucose is an aldohexose a sixcarbon aldehyde ribose is an aldopentose a fivecarbon aldehyde and fructose is a ketohexose a sixcarbon ketone Each carbon atom bearing a hydroxyl group OH with the exception of the first and last carbons are asymmetric making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each R or S Because of this asymmetry a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula Using Le Belvant Hoff rule the aldohexose Dglucose for example has the formula C·H2O6 of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic making Dglucose one of 216 possible stereoisomers In the case of glyceraldehydes an aldotriose there is one pair of possible stereoisomers which are enantiomers and epimers 1 3dihydroxyacetone the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar otherwise it is an L sugar The D and L prefixes should not be confused with d or l which indicate the direction that the sugar rotates plane polarized light This usage of d and l is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry Ringstraight chain isomerism The aldehyde or ketone group of a straightchain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and pyranose forms respectively and exist in equilibrium with the straightchain form During the conversion from straightchain form to the cyclic form the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen called the anomeric carbon becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called anomers In the α anomer the OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side trans of the ring from the CH2OH side branch The alternative form in which the CH2OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side cis of the plane of the ring is called the β anomer Use in living organisms Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for metabolism being used both as an energy source glucose being the most important in nature and in biosynthesis When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more spaceefficient forms often polysaccharides In many animals including humans this storage form is glycogen especially in liver and muscle cells In plants starch is used for the same purpose The most abundant carbohydrate cellulose is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae Ribose is a component of RNA Deoxyribose is a component of DNA Lyxose is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart Ribulose and xylulose occur in the pentose phosphate pathway Galactose a component of milk sugar lactose is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues Mannose occurs in human metabolism especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins Fructose or fruit sugar is found in many plants and in humans it is metabolized in the liver absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion and found in semen Trehalose a major sugar of insects is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight Disaccharides Main article Disaccharide Two joined monosaccharides are called a disaccharide and these are the simplest polysaccharides Examples include sucrose and lactose They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a covalent bond known as a glycosidic linkage formed via a dehydration reaction resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group from the other The formula of unmodified disaccharides is C12H22O11 Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable Sucrose pictured to the right is the most abundant disaccharide and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants It is composed of one Dglucose molecule and one Dfructose molecule The systematic name for sucrose OαDglucopyranosyl1→2Dfructofuranoside indicates four things Its monosaccharides glucose and fructose Their ring types glucose is a pyranose and fructose is a furanose How they are linked together the oxygen on carbon number 1 C1 of αDglucose is linked to the C2 of Dfructose The oside suffix indicates that the anomeric carbon of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond Lactose a disaccharide composed of one Dgalactose molecule and one Dglucose molecule occurs naturally in mammalian milk The systematic name for lactose is OβDgalactopyranosyl1→4Dglucopyranose Other notable disaccharides include maltose two Dglucoses linked α14 and cellulobiose two Dglucoses linked β14 Disaccharides can be classified into two types reducing and nonreducing disaccharides If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose Nutrition Carbohydrate consumed in food yields 387 calories of energy per gram for simple sugars and 357 to 412 calories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants including sweets cookies and candy table sugar honey soft drinks breads and crackers jams and fruit products pastas and breakfast cereals Lower amounts of carbohydrate are usually associated with unrefined foods including beans tubers rice and unrefined fruit Animalbased foods generally have the lowest carbohydrate levels although milk does contain a high proportion of lactose Carbohydrates are a common source of energy in living organisms however no carbohydrate is an essential nutrient in humans Humans are able to obtain all of their energy requirement from protein and fats though the potential for some negative health effects of extreme carbohydrate restriction remains as the issue has not been studied extensively yet However in the case of dietary fiber – indigestible carbohydrates which are not a source of energy – inadequate intake can lead to significant increases in mortality Following a diet consisting of very low amounts of daily carbohydrate for several days will usually result in higher levels of blood ketone bodies than an isocaloric diet with similar protein content This relatively high level of ketone bodies is commonly known as ketosis and is very often confused with the potentially fatal condition often seen in type 1 diabetics known as diabetic ketoacidosis Somebody suffering ketoacidosis will have much higher levels of blood ketone bodies along with high blood sugar dehydration and electrolyte imbalance Longchain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier but the liver can break these down to produce ketones However the mediumchain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain which normally relies upon glucose for its energy Gluconeogenesis allows humans to synthesize some glucose from specific amino acids from the glycerol backbone in triglycerides and in some cases from fatty acids Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other monosaccharides and disaccharides but glucose is often metabolized first In Escherichia coli for example the lac operon will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present but if both lactose and glucose are present the lac operon is repressed resulting in the glucose being used first see Diauxie Polysaccharides are also common sources of energy Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose most organisms however cannot metabolize cellulose or other polysaccharides like chitin and arabinoxylans These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists Ruminants and termites for example use microorganisms to process cellulose Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible they represent an important dietary element for humans called dietary fiber Fiber enhances digestion among other benefits Based on the effects on risk of heart disease and obesity the Institute of Medicine recommends that American and Canadian adults get between 45–65 of dietary energy from carbohydrates The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization jointly recommend that national dietary guidelines set a goal of 55–75 of total energy from carbohydrates but only 10 directly from sugars their term for simple carbohydrates Classification Nutritionists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex However the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous The term complex carbohydrate was first used in the US Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs publication Dietary Goals for the United States 1977 where it was intended to distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates which were perceived to be nutritionally superior However the report put fruit vegetables and wholegrains in the complex carbohydrate column despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food where fiber vitamins and minerals are also found as opposed to processed carbohydrates which provide energy but few other nutrients The standard usage however is to classify carbohydrates chemically simple if they are sugars monosaccharides and disaccharides and complex if they are polysaccharides or oligosaccharides In any case the simple vs complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates Some simple carbohydrates eg fructose raise blood glucose slowly while some complex carbohydrates starches especially if processed raise blood sugar rapidly The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate how the food is prepared individual differences in metabolism and the chemistry of the carbohydrate The USDAs Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 call for moderate to highcarbohydrate consumption from a balanced diet that includes six oneounce servings of grain foods each day at least half from whole grain sources and the rest from enriched The glycemic index GI and glycemic load concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion They rank carbohydraterich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on blood glucose levels Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food glucose is absorbed while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods The insulin index is a similar more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on blood insulin levels which are caused by glucose or starch and some amino acids in food Metabolism Main article Carbohydrate metabolism Carbohydrate metabolism denotes the various biochemical processes responsible for the formation breakdown and interconversion of carbohydrates in living organisms The most important carbohydrate is glucose a simple sugar monosaccharide that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms Glucose and other carbohydrates are part of a wide variety of metabolic pathways across species plants synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis storing the absorbed energy internally often in the form of starch or lipids Plant components are consumed by animals and fungi and used as fuel for cellular respiration Oxidation of one gram of carbohydrate yields approximately 4 kcal of energy while the oxidation of one gram of lipids yields about 9 kcal Energy obtained from metabolism eg oxidation of glucose is usually stored temporarily within cells in the form of ATP Organisms capable of aerobic respiration metabolize glucose and oxygen to release energy with carbon dioxide and water as byproducts Catabolism Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to extract energy There are two major metabolic pathways of monosaccharide catabolism glycolysis and the citric acid cycle In glycolysis oligopolysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called glycoside hydrolases The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism In some cases as with humans not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present Carbohydrate chemistry Carbohydrate chemistry is a large and economically important branch of organic chemistry Some of the main organic reactions that involve carbohydrates are Carbohydrate acetalisation Cyanohydrin reaction Lobryde Bruynvan Ekenstein transformation Amadori rearrangement Nef reaction Wohl degradation Koenigs–Knorr reaction
