 In organic chemistry a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon and thus are group 14 hydrides Hydrocarbons from which one hydrogen atom has been removed are functional groups called hydrocarbyls Aromatic hydrocarbons arenes alkanes alkenes cycloalkanes and alkynebased compounds are different types of hydrocarbons The majority of hydrocarbons found on Earth naturally occur in crude oil where decomposed organic matter provides an abundance of carbon and hydrogen which when bonded can catenate to form seemingly limitless chains Types of hydrocarbons The classifications for hydrocarbons defined by IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry are as follows Saturated hydrocarbons are the simplest of the hydrocarbon species They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen The formula for acyclic saturated hydrocarbons ie alkanes is CnH2n2 The most general form of saturated hydrocarbons is CnH2n21r where r is the number of rings Those with exactly one ring are the cycloalkanes Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched species Substitution reaction is their characteristics property like chlorination reaction to form chloroform Hydrocarbons with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae are called structural isomers As given in the example of 3methylhexane and its higher homologues branched hydrocarbons can be chiral Chiral saturated hydrocarbons constitute the side chains of biomolecules such as chlorophyll and tocopherol Unsaturated hydrocarbons have one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms Those with double bond are called alkenes Those with one double bond have the formula CnH2n assuming noncyclic structures Those containing triple bonds are called alkynes with general formula CnH2n−2 Aromatic hydrocarbons also known as arenes are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring Hydrocarbons can be gases eg methane and propane liquids eg hexane and benzene waxes or low melting solids eg paraffin wax and naphthalene or polymers eg polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene General properties Because of differences in molecular structure the empirical formula remains different between hydrocarbons in linear or straightrun alkanes alkenes and alkynes the amount of bonded hydrogen lessens in alkenes and alkynes due to the selfbonding or catenation of carbon preventing entire saturation of the hydrocarbon by the formation of double or triple bonds This inherent ability of hydrocarbons to bond to themselves is known as catenation and allows hydrocarbons to form more complex molecules such as cyclohexane and in rarer cases arenes such as benzene This ability comes from the fact that the bond character between carbon atoms is entirely nonpolar in that the distribution of electrons between the two elements is somewhat even due to the same electronegativity values of the elements 030 and does not result in the formation of an electrophile Generally with catenation comes the loss of the total amount of bonded hydrocarbons and an increase in the amount of energy required for bond cleavage due to strain exerted upon the molecule in molecules such as cyclohexane this is referred to as ring strain and occurs due to the destabilized spatial electron configuration of the atom In simple chemistry as per valence bond theory the carbon atom must follow the 4hydrogen rule which states that the maximum number of atoms available to bond with carbon is equal to the number of electrons that are attracted into the outer shell of carbon In terms of shells carbon consists of an incomplete outer shell which comprises 4 electrons and thus has 4 electrons available for covalent or dative bonding Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic like lipids Some hydrocarbons also are abundant in the solar system Lakes of liquid methane and ethane have been found on Titan Saturns largest moon confirmed by the CassiniHuygens Mission Hydrocarbons are also abundant in nebulae forming polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH compounds Simple hydrocarbons and their variations Usage Hydrocarbons are a primary energy source for current civilizations The predominant use of hydrocarbons is as a combustible fuel source In their solid form hydrocarbons take the form of asphalt bitumen Mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons are now used in preference to the chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant for aerosol sprays due to chlorofluorocarbons impact on the ozone layer Methane CH4 and ethane C2H6 are gaseous at ambient temperatures and cannot be readily liquefied by pressure alone Propane C3H8 is however easily liquefied and exists in propane bottles mostly as a liquid Butane C4H10 is so easily liquefied that it provides a safe volatile fuel for small pocket lighters Pentane C5H12 is a clear liquid at room temperature commonly used in chemistry and industry as a powerful nearly odorless solvent of waxes and high molecular weight organic compounds including greases Hexane C6H14 is also a widely used nonpolar nonaromatic solvent as well as a significant fraction of common gasoline The C through C alkanes alkenes and isomeric cycloalkanes are the top components of gasoline naphtha jet fuel and specialized industrial solvent mixtures With the progressive addition of carbon units the simple nonring structured hydrocarbons have higher viscosities lubricating indices boiling points solidification temperatures and deeper color At the opposite extreme from methane lie the heavy tars that remain as the lowest fraction in a crude oil refining retort They are collected and widely utilized as roofing compounds pavement composition wood preservatives the creosote series and as extremely high viscosity shearresisting liquids Hydrocarbon use is also prevalent in nature Some eusocial arthropods such as the Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana quadripunctata use unique hydrocarbon scents in order to determine kin from nonkin The chemical hydrocarbon composition varies between age sex nest location and hierarchal position Poisoning Hydrocarbon poisoning such as that of benzene and petroleum usually occurs accidentally by inhalation or ingestion of these cytotoxic chemical compounds Intravenous or subcutaneous injection of petroleum compounds with intent of suicide or abuse is an extraordinary event that can result in local damage or systemic toxicity such as tissue necrosis abscess formation respiratory system failure and partial damage to the kidneys the brain and the nervous system Moaddab and Eskandarlou report a case of chest wall necrosis and empyema resulting from attempting suicide by injection of petroleum into the pleural cavity Reactions There are three main types of reactions Substitution reaction Addition reaction Combustion Substitution reactions Substitution reactions only occur in saturated hydrocarbons single carbon–carbon bonds In this reaction an alkane reacts with a chlorine molecule One of the chlorine atoms displaces a hydrogen atom This forms hydrochloric acid as well as the hydrocarbon with one chlorine atom all the way to CCl4 carbon tetrachloride all the way to C2Cl6 hexachloroethane Addition reactions Addition reactions involve alkenes and alkynes In this reaction a halogen molecule breaks the double or triple bond in the hydrocarbon and forms a bond Combustion Main article Combustion Hydrocarbons are currently the main source of the worlds electric energy and heat sources such as home heating because of the energy produced when burnt Often this energy is used directly as heat such as in home heaters which use either petroleum or natural gas The hydrocarbon is burnt and the heat is used to heat water which is then circulated A similar principle is used to create electric energy in power plants Common properties of hydrocarbons are the facts that they produce steam carbon dioxide and heat during combustion and that oxygen is required for combustion to take place The simplest hydrocarbon methane burns as follows In inadequate supply of air carbon monoxide gas and water vapour are formed Another example of this reaction is propane Burning of hydrocarbons is an example of an exothermic chemical reaction Hydrocarbons can also be burned with elemental fluorine resulting in carbon tetrafluoride and hydrogen fluoride products Petroleum Main article Petroleum Extracted hydrocarbons in a liquid form are referred to as petroleum literally rock oil or mineral oil whereas hydrocarbons in a gaseous form are referred to as natural gas Petroleum and natural gas are found in the Earths subsurface with the tools of petroleum geology and are a significant source of fuel and raw materials for the production of organic chemicals The extraction of liquid hydrocarbon fuel from sedimentary basins is integral to modern energy development Hydrocarbons are mined from oil sands and oil shale and potentially extracted from sedimentary methane hydrates These reserves require distillation and upgrading to produce synthetic crude and petroleum Oil reserves in sedimentary rocks are the source of hydrocarbons for the energy transport and petrochemical industries Economically important hydrocarbons include fossil fuels such as coal petroleum and natural gas and its derivatives such as plastics paraffin waxes solvents and oils Hydrocarbons – along with NOx and sunlight – contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone and greenhouse gases Bioremediation Bacteria in the gabbroic layer of the oceans crust can degrade hydrocarbons but the extreme environment makes research difficult Other bacteria such as Lutibacterium anuloederans can also degrade hydrocarbons Mycoremediation or breaking down of hydrocarbon by mycellium and mushroom is possible Safety Many hydrocarbons are highly flammable therefore care should be taken to prevent injury Benzene and many aromatic compounds are possible carcinogens and proper safety equipment must be worn to prevent these harmful compounds from entering the body If hydrocarbons undergo combustion in tight areas toxic carbon monoxide can form Hydrocarbons should be kept away from fluorine compounds due to the high probability of forming toxic hydrofluoric acid Environmental impact Hydrocarbons are introduced into the environment through their extensive use as fuels and chemicals as well as through leaks or accidental spills during exploration production reﬁning or transport Anthropogenic hydrocarbon
