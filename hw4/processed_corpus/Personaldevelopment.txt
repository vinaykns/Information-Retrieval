using standard criteria Personaldevelopment frameworks may include goals or benchmarks that define the endpoints strategies or plans for reaching goals measurement and assessment of progress levels or stages that define milestones along a development path and a feedback system to provide information on changes As an industry Personal development as an industry has several business relationship

selfhelp industry Origins Major religions – such as the Abrahamic and Indian religions – as well as New Age philosophies have used practices such as prayer music dance singing chanting poetry writing sports and martial arts These practices have various functions such as health or aesthetic satisfaction but they may also link to final goals of personal development such as discovering the meaning of life or living the good life compare philosophy Michel Foucault describes in Care of the Self the techniques of epimelia used in ancient Greece and Rome which included dieting exercise sexual abstinence contemplation prayer and confession—some of which also became important practices within different branches of Christianity In yoga a discipline originating in India possibly over 3000 years ago personaldevelopment techniques include meditation rhythmic breathing stretching and postures YiWushu and Tai chi chuan utilise traditional Chinese techniques including breathing and energy exercises meditation martial arts as well as practices linked to traditional Chinese medicine such as dieting massage and acupuncture In Islam which arose almost 1500 years ago in the Middle East personaldevelopment techniques include ritual prayer recitation of the Quran pilgrimage fasting and tazkiyah purification of the soul Two individual ancient philosophers Aristotle and the Western Tradition and Confucius and the Eastern Tradition stand out as major sources of what has become personal development in the 21st century representing a Western tradition and an East Asian tradition Elsewhere anonymous founders of schools of selfdevelopment appear endemic – note the traditions of the Indian subcontinent in this regard South Asian traditions Some ancient Indians aspired to beingness wisdom and happiness Aristotle and the Western tradition The Greek philosopher Aristotle 384 BCE – 322 BCE influenced theories of personal development in the West In his Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle defined personal development as a category of phronesis or practical wisdom where the practice of virtues arête leads to eudaimonia commonly translated as happiness but more accurately understood as human flourishing or living well Aristotle continues to influence the Western concept of personal development to this day particularly in the economics of human development and in positive psychology Confucius and the East Asian tradition In Chinese tradition Confucius around 551 BCE – 479 BCE founded an ongoing philosophy His ideas continue to influence family values education and management in China and East Asia In his Great Learning Confucius wrote The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom first ordered well their own states Wishing to order well their states they first regulated their families Wishing to regulate their families they first cultivated their persons Wishing to cultivate their persons they first rectified their hearts Wishing to rectify their hearts they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts they first extended to the utmost their knowledge Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things Contexts Psychology Psychology became linked to personal development in the early 20th century starting with Alfred Adler 1870–1937 and Carl Jung 1875–1961 Adler refused to limit psychology to analysis making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences He also originated the concepts of lifestyle 1929—he defined lifestyle as an individuals characteristic approach to life in facing problems and of self image a concept that influenced management under the heading of worklife balance Carl Gustav Jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of individuation which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the Self Daniel Levinson 1920–1994 developed Jungs early concept of life stages and included a sociological perspective Levinson proposed that personal development come under the influence—throughout life—of aspirations which he called the Dream Whatever the nature of his Dream a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out It makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the Dream or opposed to it If the Dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose Levinsons model of seven lifestages has been considerably modified due to sociological changes in the lifecycle Research on success in reaching goals as undertaken by Albert Bandura born 1925 suggested that selfefficacy best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results According to Bandura selfconfidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because it makes you expect to succeed it allows you take risks and set challenging goals it helps you keep trying if at first you dont succeed it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough In 1998 Martin Seligman won election to a oneyear term as President of the American Psychological Association and proposed a new focus on healthy individuals rather than on pathology he created the positive psychology current We have discovered that there is a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against mental illness courage optimism interpersonal skill work ethic hope honesty and perseverance Much of the task of prevention will be to create a science of human strength whose mission will be to foster these virtues in young people Higher education Personal development has been at the heart of education in the West in the form of the Greek philosophers and in the East with Confucius Some people emphasize personal development as a part of higher education Wilhelm von Humboldt who founded the University of Berlin since 1949 Humboldt University of Berlin in 1810 made a statement interpretable as referring to personal development … if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual it is precisely education whose object it is to develop the individual During the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on American campuses led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students Arthur Chickering defined seven vectors of personal development for young adults during their undergraduate years developing competence managing emotions achieving autonomy and interdependence developing mature interpersonal relationships establishing identity developing purpose developing integrity In the UK personal development took a central place in university policy in 1997 when the Dearing Report declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal development In 2001 a Quality Assessment Agency for UK universities produced guidelines for universities to enhance personal development as a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning performance and or achievement and to plan for their personal educational and career development objectives related explicitly to student development to improve the capacity of students to understand what and how they are learning and to review plan and take responsibility for their own learning In the 1990s business schools began to set up specific personaldevelopment programs for leadership and career orientation and in 1998 the European Foundation for Management Development set up the EQUIS accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs The first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between Metizo a personaldevelopment consulting firm and the Euromed Management School in Marseilles students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate selfawareness and achievement of personaldevelopment competencies As an academic department personal development has become a specific discipline usually associated with business schools As an area of research personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines education for questions of learning and assessment psychology for motivation and personality sociology for identity and social networks economics for human capital and economic value philosophy for ethics and selfreflection The workplace Abraham Maslow 1908–1970 proposed a hierarchy of needs with self actualization at the top defined as … the desire to become more and more what one is to become everything that one is capable of becoming Since Maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people selfactualize—he estimated one percent—his hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard selfactualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees As organizations and labor markets became more global responsibility for development shifted from the company to the individual In 1999 management thinker Peter Drucker wrote in the Harvard Business Review We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity if youve got ambition and smarts you can rise to the top of your chosen profession regardless of where you started out But with opportunity comes responsibility Companies today arent managing their employees careers knowledge workers must effectively be their own chief executive officers Its up to you to carve out your place to know when to change course and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years Management professors Sumantra Ghoshal of the London Business School and Christopher Bartlett of the Harvard Business School wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract On the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative creativity and skills of all employees On the other hand employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development The 1997 publication of Ghoshals and Bartletts Individualized Corporation corresponded to a change in career development from a system of predefined paths defined by companies to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities Another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that womens careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men The 2007 study of womens careers by Sylvia Ann Hewlett OffRamps and OnRamps had a major impact on the way companies view careers Further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by Herminia Ibarra in her Working Identity on the relationship with career change and identity change indicating that priorities of work and lifestyle continually develop through life Personal development programs in companies fall into two categories the provision of employee benefits and the fostering of development strategies Employee benefits have the purpose of improving satisfaction motivation and loyalty Employee surveys may help organizations find out personaldevelopment needs preferences and problems and they use the results to design benefits programs Typical programs in this category include worklife balance time management stress management health programs counseling Many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work yoga sports martial arts moneymanagement positive psychology NLP etc As an investment personal development programs have the goal of increasing human capital or improving productivity innovation or quality Proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organizations strategic development goals Employees gain access to these investmentoriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee usually defined in a talent management architecture including populations such as new hires perceived highpotential employees perceived key employees sales staff research staff and perceived future leaders Organizations may also offer other noninvestmentoriented programs to many or even all employees Typical programs focus on careerdevelopment personal effectiveness teamwork and competencydevelopment Personal development also forms an element in management tools such as personal development planning assessing ones level of ability using a competency grid or getting feedback from a 360 questionnaire filled in by colleagues at different levels in the organization Criticism Scholars have targeted selfhelp claims as misleading and incorrect In 2005 Steve Salerno portrayed the American selfhelp movement—he uses the acronym SHAM The SelfHelp and Actualization Movement—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful Salerno says that 80 percent of selfhelp and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or not Others similarly point out that with selfhelp books supply increases the demandThe more people read them the more they think they need themmore like an addiction than an alliance Selfhelp writers have been described as working in the area of the ideological the imagined the narrativizedalthough a veneer of scientism permeates their work there is also an underlying armature of moralizing See also Coaching Endofhistory illusion Holland Codes Know thyself Life planning Life skills Selfactualization Selfdiscovery Selfhelp Training
