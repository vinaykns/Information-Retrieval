 The American Council of Engineering Companies ACEC is a trade association founded in 1909 to promote the business interests of engineers in private practice in the United States ACEC is a federation of 51 state and regional councils with national headquarters in Washington DC History ACEC traces its roots to the founding of the American Institute of Consulting Engineers AICE in 1909 In its first years AICE was largely a New York Cityfocused organization with more than half of its members working in the New York City area The organization was active in opposing the use of publicly employed engineers on public projects and advocated for engineers to be hired based on their qualifications rather than price In 1956 representatives from 10 state associations representing consulting engineers met in Tulsa Oklahoma and created the Consulting Engineers Council a nationwide association to promote the business interests of engineers The new organization had an initial membership of 494 individuals and firms In 1959 it joined the International Federation of Consulting Engineers FIDIC By 1960 CEC had 29 statebased member organizations represented more than 1000 firms and had established a group liability insurance program It supported the passage of the AE Selection Procedures Act also known as the Brooks Act in 1972 which requires that the US Federal Government select engineering and architecture firms based upon their competency qualifications and experience rather than by price The Council has been a major supporter of the Acts QualificationsBased Selection QBS rules ever since repeatedly beating back efforts from federal agencies to use price in procuring engineering services In 1973 CEC and AICE merged to form the American Consulting Engineers Council ACEC In 1986 ACEC founded the American Tort Reform Association ATRA to address what it considers unfair liability statutes nationwide In 1998 it supported the inclusion of a provision in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century TEA21 to require state transportation departments to follow QBS guidelines In 2000 the organization changed its name to the American Council of Engineering Companies to reflect its firmbased membership All of the 51 state and regional councils have since followed suit Later that year it backed the Thomas Amendment in the Water Resources and Development Act which limited the ability of the US Army Corps of Engineers to compete with private engineering firms in municipal works such as schools and utilities In 2004 it helped win passage of a 9 percent tax deduction for engineering firms as part of the American Jobs Creation Act In 2012 ACEC along with the American Public Works Association APWA and American Society of Civil Engineers ASCE founded the
