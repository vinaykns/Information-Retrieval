 EPA and Environmental Protection Agency redirect here For other uses see EPA disambiguation The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA or sometimes USEPA is an agency of the Federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon and began operation on December 2 1970 after Nixon signed an executive order The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate The agency is led by its Administrator who is appointed by the president and approved by Congress The current administrator is Scott Pruitt The EPA is not a Cabinet department but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank The EPA has its headquarters in Washington DC regional offices for each of the agencys ten regions and 27 laboratories The agency conducts environmental assessment research and education It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws in consultation with state tribal and local governments It delegates some permitting monitoring and enforcement responsibility to US states and the federally recognized tribes EPA enforcement powers include fines sanctions and other measures The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts In 2016 the agency had 15376 fulltime employees More than half of EPAs employees are engineers scientists and environmental protection specialists other employees include legal public affairs financial and information technologists History Beginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959 was introduced by Senator James E Murray in the 86th Congress In the years following similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congresss potential responses In 1968 a joint HouseSenate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs Senator Henry M Jackson and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics Representative George Miller to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy In the colloquium some Members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 NEPA 42 USC §§ 4321–4347 was modeled on RCA That bill would have established an Council on Environmental Quality in the office of the President declared a national environmental policy and required the preparation of an annual environmental report NEPA was declared and President Nixon signed it into law on January 1 1970 NEPA created a Council on Environmental Quality CEQ in the Executive Office of the President NEPA required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment The detailed statement would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement EIS In 1970 President Richard Nixon proposed an executive reorganization that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency a new Environmental Protection Agency House and Senate reviewed and passed the proposal Staff recall that in the early days there was an enormous sense of purpose and excitement and the expectation that “there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country” leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America’s environment When EPA first began the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad and the agency’s first administrator William Ruckelshaus felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government’s effectiveness that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution The EPA began regulating greenhouse gases GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act CAA for the first time on January 2 2011 Standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to Section 202 of the CAA and GHGs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of Part C of Title I of the Act per Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Under the Clean Air Act In May 2013 Congress renamed the EPA headquarters as the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building after former president Bill Clinton Organization The EPA is led by an Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency As of 2017 Scott Pruitt is the 14th administrator Offices Office of the Administrator OA Office of Administration and Resources Management OARM Office of Air and Radiation OAR Office

for EPA was that air water waste and other programs would be unconnected placed in “silos” a problem that persists more than 50 years later albeit less so than at the start EPA Safer Choice The EPA Safer Choice label previously known as the Design for the Environment DfE label helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients without sacrificing quality or performance When a product has the Safer Choice label it means that every intentionallyadded ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative Through the Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative SDSI EPAs Design for the Environment DfE recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants Safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to nonpolluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water Nonylphenol ethoxylates commonly referred to as NPEs are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant The Design for the Environment which was renamed to EPA Safer Choice in 2015 has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates These safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available CleanGredients is a source of safer surfactants Energy Star In 1992 the EPA launched the Energy Star program a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency As of 2006 more than 40000 Energy Star products were available including major appliances office equipment lighting home electronics and more In addition the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings In 2006 about 12 percent of new housing in the United States was labeled Energy Star The EPA estimates it saved about 14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone The Energy Star program has helped spread the use of LED traffic lights efficient fluorescent lighting power management systems for office equipment and low standby energy use SmartGrowth EPAs Smart Growth Program begaun in 1998 is to help communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want Together with local state and national experts EPA encourage development strategies that protect human health and the environment create economic opportunities and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels Pesticides EPA administers the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA which is much older than the agency and registers all pesticides legally sold in the United States Fuel economy Manufacturers selling automobiles in the United States are required to provide EPA fuel economy test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources The fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicles Clean Air Act certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests The testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rushhour in Los Angeles during that era Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test In 1984 the EPA began adjusting city aka Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or UDDS results downward by 10 and highway aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET results by 22 to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972 and to better correlate the EPA test results with realworld driving In 1996 the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures to add a new higherspeed test US06 and an airconditioneron test SC03 to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with realworld reports In December 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12year review cycle for the test procedures In February 2005 EPA launched a program called Your MPG that allows drivers to add realworld fuel economy statistics into a database on the EPAs fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original EPA test results The EPA conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles Just 18 of the EPAs 17000 employees work in the automobiletesting department in Ann Arbor Michigan examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year or roughly 15 percent of new models As to that other 85 percent the EPA takes automakers at their word—without any testingaccepting submitted results as accurate Twothirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons Although originally created as a reference point for fossilfueled vehicles driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge Air quality The Air Quality Modeling Group AQMG is in the EPAs Office of Air and Radiation OAR and leads in the full range of air quality models atmospheric dispersion modeling and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing the impacts of air pollution sources and control strategies It serves other EPA headquarters staff EPA regional Offices and State and local environmental agencies coordinates with the EPAs Office of Research and Development on the development of new models and techniques and wider issues of atmospheric research and conducts modeling analyses to support policy and regulatory decisions of the EPAs Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards OAQPS It is located in Research Triangle Park North Carolina Controlling air pollution helps diminish the risk of pollutionrelated diseases Oil spill prevention program EPA’s oil spill prevention program includes the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure SPCC and the Facility Response Plan FRP rules The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store handle process gather transfer refine distribute use or consume oil or oil products Oil products includes petroleum and nonpetroleum oils as well as animal fats oils and greases fish and marine mammal oils and vegetable oils It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42000 gallons belowground and which might discharge to navigable waters as defined in the Clean Water Act or adjoining shorelines Secondary spill containment is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites Toxics Release Inventory The Toxics Release Inventory TRI is a resource for learning about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities TRI data support informed decisionmaking by communities government agencies companies and others WaterSense WaterSense is an EPA program launched in June 2006 to encourage water efficiency in the United States through the use of a special label on consumer products Products include highefficiency toilets HETs bathroom sink faucets and accessories and irrigation equipment WaterSense is a voluntary program with EPA developing specifications for waterefficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories Drinking water EPA ensures safe drinking water for the public by setting standards for more than 160000 public water systems nationwide EPA oversees states local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act The program includes regulation of injection wells in order to protect underground sources of drinking water Select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water precipitation and surface water in addition to milk and air are reported on EPAs Rad Net web site in a section entitled Envirofacts Despite mandatory reporting certain readings exceeding EPA MCL levels may be deleted or not included In 2013 an EPA draft revision relaxed regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water stating that current standards are impractical to enforce The EPA recommended that intervention was not necessary until drinking water was contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81000 picocuries per liter the limit for short term exposure set by the International Atomic Energy Agency which was 27000 times the prior EPA limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources which discharge pollutants to US waters Created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act the NPDES permit program is authorized to state governments to perform its many permitting administrative and enforcement aspects Radiation protection EPA has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation Radioactive Waste Management Emergency Preparedness and Response Programs Protective Action Guides And Planning Guidance for Radiological Incidents EPA developed a manual as guideline for local and state governments to protect the public from a nuclear accident the 2017 version being a 15 year update EPA’s Role in Emergency Response Special Teams Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials TENORM Program Radiation Standards for Air and Drinking Water Programs Federal Guidance for Radiation Protection Tools for Schools EPAs Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools Program helps schools to maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants It helps school personnel identify solve and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment Through the use of a multistep management plan and checklists for the entire building schools can lower their students and staffs risk of exposure to asthma triggers Environmental Education The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 requires EPA to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy EPA established the Office of Environmental Education to implement this program Environmental Impact Statement Reviews EPA is responsible for reviewing Environmental Impact Statements of other federal agencies projects under the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA Clean School Bus USA Clean School Bus USA is a national partnership to reduce childrens exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones Its goal is to reduce both childrens exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses Environmental justice The EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice Administrator Christine Todd Whitman was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clintons Executive Order 12898 during 2001 removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order In a March 2004 report the inspector general of the agency concluded that the EPA has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan and has not established values goals expectations and performance measurements for environmental justice in its daily operations Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs policies and activities towards environmental justice Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPAs Superfund program and that this situation was worsening Barriers to enforcing environmental justice Many environmental justice issues are localized and therefore difficult to address by a federal agency such as the EPA Without strong media attention political interest or crisis status local issues are less likely to be addressed at the federal level compared to larger well publicized incidents Conflicting political powers in successive administrations The White House maintains direct control over the EPA and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power Republicans and Democrats differ in their approaches to environmental justice While President Bill Clinton signed the executive order 12898 the Bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices affecting the motivation for environmental enforcement The EPA is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes informing the public of environmental enforcement and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution water pollution hazardous wastes and chemicals It is difficult to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities It is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to The EPA answers to various groups competes for resources and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment All of these present challenges including a lack of resources its selfpolicing policy and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for EPA officers The EPA does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities Research vessel Main article USNS Bold TAGOS12 On March 3 2004 the United States Navy transferred USNS Bold a Stalwart class ocean surveillance ship to the EPA now known as OSV Bold The ship previously used in antisubmarine operations during the Cold War is equipped with sidescan sonar underwater video water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline One of the major missions of the Bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials are dumped from dredging operations in US ports In 2013 the Bold was awarded to Seattle Central Community College SCCC by the General Services Administration SCCC demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose and acquired the ship at a cost of 5000 Advance identification Advance identification or ADID is a planning process used by the EPA to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material The EPA conducts the process in cooperation with the US Army Corps of Engineers and local states or Native American Tribes As of February 1993 38 ADID projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing Freedom of Information Act processing performance In the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests published in 2015 using 2012 and 2013 data the most recent years available the EPA earned a D by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points ie did not earn a satisfactory overall grade Controversies 1983present Fiscal mismanagement 1983 In 1982 Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the 16 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps Superfund and demanded records from EPA director Anne M Gorsuch She refused and became the first agency director in US history to be cited for contempt of Congress The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoened by Congress because they were covered by executive privilege At that point Gorsuch resigned her post citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation Critics charged that the EPA was in a shambles at that time Gorsuch appointed by Ronald Reagan resigned under fire in 1983 Gorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the New Federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states She believed that the EPA was overregulating business and that the agency was too large and not costeffective During her 22 months as agency head she cut the budget of the EPA by 22 reduced the number of cases filed against polluters relaxed Clean Air Act regulations and facilitated the spraying of restricteduse pesticides She cut the total number of agency employees and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating Environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency Political pressure and scientific integrity 2001present In April 2008 the Union of Concerned Scientists said that more than half of the nearly 1600 EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work The survey included chemists toxicologists engineers geologists and experts in other fields of science About 40 of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life EPA research has also been suppressed by career managers Supervisors at EPAs National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peerreviewed journal article about EPAs integrated risk information system which led two coauthors to have their names removed from the publication and the corresponding author ChingHung Hsu to leave EPA because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing EPA subjects employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint even if those papers are written on personal time EPA employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry and governmental pressure and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports In 2015 the Government Accountability Office stated that the EPA violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms The social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the Waters of the United States rule including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule Hillview reservoir cost 2005 In 2005 the EPA issued the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule LT2 which requires covering openair reservoirs containing finished drinking water in order to reduce the incidence of disease caused by microorganisms in drinking water To comply with the rule the EPA ordered that a cap be placed over the Hillview Reservoir where water bound for New York City receives its final disinfection before entering the pipelines serving the city A number of city and state officials complained that the project was too costly and unnecessary Fuel economy 20052010 In July 2005 an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuelefficient cars was delayed The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute In 2007 the state of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars EPA administrator Stephen L Johnson claimed that the EPA was working on its own standards but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level which would then preempt state laws California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger along with governors from 13 other states stated that the EPAs actions ignored federal law and that existing California standards adopted by many states in addition to California were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards It was reported that Stephen Johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision After the federal government had bailed out General Motors and Chrysler in the Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010 the 2010 Chevrolet Equinox was released with an EPA fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors Independent road tests found that the vehicle did not outperform its competitors which had much lower fuel economy ratings Later road tests found better but inconclusive results Mercury emissions 2005 In March 2005 nine states California New York New Jersey New Hampshire Massachusetts Maine Connecticut New Mexico and Vermont sued the EPA The EPAs Inspector General had determined that the EPAs regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by Harvard University which contradicted its position on mercury controls The suit alleged that the EPAs rule exempting coalfired power plants from maximum available control technology was illegal and additionally charged that the EPAs system of capandtrade to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations Illinoiss proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90 by 2009 In 2008—by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit—the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA regulations violated the Clean Air Act In response EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule and did so on March 16 2011 Climate change 20072010 In December 2007 EPA Administrator Stephen L Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory globalwarming regulations Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett emailed the draft to the White House White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnsons finding would be Burnett said They also knew that once they opened the attachment it would become a public record making it controversial and difficult to rescind So they did not open it rather they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft Johnson rescinded the draft in July 2008 he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare Burnett resigned in protest A 3 million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama Administrations and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps Gold King Mine waste water spill 2015 Main article 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill On August 5 2015 while examining the level of pollutants in the Gold King Mine EPA contractors released over three million gallons of toxic waste water including heavy metals such as lead and arsenic into Cement Creek which flowed into the Animas River in Colorado President Trump 2017 Since taking office January 2017 Donald Trump has sought to reduce EPA employees´ amount of public interaction via social media The president has barred EPA employees from awarding new contracts or grants as well Some career environmental regulators who conceded that they remained worried about what President Trump might do on policy matters—said such orders were not much different from those delivered by the Obama administration as it shifted policies from the departing White House of George W Bush The Associated Press quoted employees as saying this was unusual Trump has targeted 30 environmental rules for delayed implementation including updated pollution rulings for several states renewable fuel standards and limits on the amount of formaldehyde that can leach from wood products In February 2017 US Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida sponsored a bill to abolish the EPA by 2018 According to Gaetz The American people are drowning in rules and regulation promulgated by unelected bureaucrats And the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender The bill was cosponsored by Thomas Massie RKy Steven Palazzo
