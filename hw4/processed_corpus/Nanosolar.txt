 Nanosolar was a developer of solar power technology Based in San Jose CA Nanosolar developed and briefly commercialized a lowcost printable solar cell manufacturing process The company started selling thinfilm CIGS panels midDecember 2007 and planned to sell them at 99 cents per watt much below the market at the time However prices for solar panels made of crystalline silicon declined significantly during the following years reducing most of Nanosolars cost advantage By February 2013 Nanosolar had laid off 75 of its work force Nanosolar began auctioning off its equipment in August 2013 CoFounder of Nanosolar Martin Roscheisen stated on his personal blog that nanosolar ultimately failed commercially and that he would not enter this industry again because of slowdevelopment cycle complex production problems and the impact of cheap Chinese solar power production Nanosolar ultimately produced less than 50 MW of solar power capacity despite having raised more than 400 million in investment Financial backers and manufacturing Nanosolar was started in 2002 and is headquartered in San Jose California The company has received financing from a number of technology investors including Benchmark Capital Mohr Davidow Ventures and Larry Page and Sergey Brin the founders of Google Nanosolar received the largest amount in a round of Venture Capital technology funding amongst United States companies during Q2 2006 with 100 million USD of new funding secured It also received the largest amount of financing of any private company in 2008 USD 300 million in Q1 Nanosolar planned to build a large production facility in San Jose and in Germany at Luckenwalde Berlin with an annual capacity of 430 megawatts Several German energy and venture capital companies have heavily invested in this company as a consequence of the favourable economics for solar energy in Germany due to government subsidies On December 12 2007 the company announced that it had started solar cell production in its San Jose factory with its German facility slated to go into operation in the 1st quarter of 2008 The company said in 2006 that the San Jose factory when fully built would have the capacity to produce 430 megawatts of cells each year On December 18 2007 the company began shipping its first solar panels for a onemegawatt municipal power plant in Germany As of 2008 Nanosolar had raised about 500 million USD in total funding by private investors Benchmark Capital Mitsui Ventures Mohr Davidow Ventures OnPoint Capricorn Management Firelake Capital Management GLG Partners Grazia Equity Swiss Re Beck Energy Omidyar Network Lone Pine Capital Energy Capital Partners Riverstone Holdings EDF Ventures The Skoll Foundation EDS HP and The Carlyle Group On February 17 2012 Nanosolar announced they had achieved 115MW capacity 20 Million in additional funding to further expand manufacturing capacity and a NREL ThinFilm Solar Aperture Efficiency of 171 This capacity is just over one quarter of the 430 megawatts predicted five years previously Management On Jan 19 2012 former EVP of Engineering Operations Eugenia Corrales was named CEO following CEO Geoff Tate returning to retirement Tate had been CEO of Nanosolar since March 22 2010 having been hired out of retirement as an interim CEO for his experience in leading a company into volume production as CEO of Rambus Tate replaced cofounder Martin Roscheisen who had been the companys Chairman CEO for the past eight years no reason was given for Roscheisens exit On June 25 2012 nano solar hired 3 new sales marketing executives Stephan Hansen executive vice president of Worldwide Sales Roy Shaw head of North America Sales and Stefan Zschiegner vice president of Worldwide Marketing Prior to joining Nanosolar Hansen led the European sales organization of First Solar for more than seven years Shaw brings over 25 years of sales management experience in the solar industry He most recently was director of USA Sales at Jinko Solar a global PV manufacturer producing crystalline ingots wafers cells and mono and multi crystalline PV panels Prior to Jinko Solar he was head of Western Sales at Suntech Solar Corp a global producer of silicon solar modules Zschiegner most recently was vice president of Global Product Management and Applications at First Solar where he focused on solutions for emerging markets balanceofsystem and module product management On Sep 11 2012 Nanosolar appointed Karl Steigele to the position of President COO Eugenia Corrales left the company to pursue other ventures Before joining Nanosolar Steigele spent more than 30 years in international management and consulting at IBM where he worked with Fortune 500 global manufacturing companies including Intel Hitachi ABB Thomson Siemens Sony and McKesson among others Technology The company used thin film technology to manufacture CIGS solar cells that use a semiconductor material made of copper indium gallium and selenium and achieved an efficiency of up to 199 in laboratory samples at the time The companys technology gained early industry recognition with the presentation of a Small Times Magazine award at a leading nanotech business event in 2005 Technical details of Nanosolars manufacturing techniques have been disclosed in patent applications Some information about their process has become available in a Scientific American article in German These details involve a semiconductor ink that it claims will enable it to produce solar cells with a basic printing process rather than using slow and expensive highvacuum based thinfilm deposition processes The ink is deposited on a flexible substrate the “paper” and then nanocomponents in the ink align themselves properly via molecular selfassembly Nanosolars solar cells have been verified by NREL to be as efficient as 146 in 2006 153 in 2009 and 171 in 2011 Efficiencies for current production panels are said to be 89 with plans to submit panels with 1011 efficiency for IEC certification in the fall of 2010 In September 2009 Nanosolar announced the launch of production at a rate of 640 MW annually however rampup to volume production after the announcement took an additional six months limiting actual production in 2009 to an estimated 4 MW and as of August 2010 the plant was still ramping up toward its announced capacity Since the hiring of new CEO Geoff Tate the company has declined to discuss its actual manufacturing capacity but has said that its target for 2010 is to ship panels for several megawattsize projects and build panels for projects that have been identified that can help build the case for an operating history and bankability in 2011 Nanosolar has developed a suite of inhouse capabilities for creating nanostructured components based on various patented and patentpending techniques It uses nanostructured components as the basis for creating printable semiconductors printable transparent electrodes novel forms of advanced nanocomposite solarcell design and powerful new forms of barrier films According to the company leveraging recent science advances in nanostructured materials Nanosolar has developed a proprietary ink that makes it possible to simply print the semiconductor of a highperformance solar cell This ink is based on Nanosolar developing various proprietary forms of nanoparticles and associated organic dispersion chemistry and processing techniques suitable for delivering a semiconductor of high electronic quality Two advantages over earlier technologies is that a printing process is quick and also makes it easy to deposit a uniform layer of the ink resulting in a layer with the correct ratio of elements everywhere on the substrate Also the ink is printed only where needed so there is less waste of material Last the substrate material on which the ink is printed is much more conductive and less expensive than the stainless steel substrates that are often used in thinfilm solar panels These solar cells successfully blend the needs for efficiency low cost and longevity and will be easy to install due to their flexibility and light weight Estimates by Nanosolar of the cost of these cells fall roughly between 110 and 15 the industry standard per kilowatt However solar module prices have fallen by 60 since that prediction in 2006 The company implies that their solar cells can last more than 25 years by saying they achieve a durability compatible with our 25year warranty They recently commissioned a study by Black and Veatch that finds their 25year warranty to be compatible with their module design See also List of CIGS companies References
