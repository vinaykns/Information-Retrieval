 Child mortality also known as under5 mortality or child death refers to the death of infants and children under the age of five or between the age of one month to four years depending on the definition A childs death is emotionally and physically hard on the parents Many deaths in the majority of the world go unreported since many poor families cannot afford to register their babies in the government registry The same causes and preventative measures that apply to infant mortality ie for children younger than one year old also apply to understanding child mortality Reduction of child mortality is the fourth of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Rapid progress towards the Millennium Development Goals has resulted in a significant decline in preventable child deaths since 1990 with the global under5 mortality rate declining by nearly half over this time period While in 1990 127 million children under age five died in 2013 that number fell to 63 million children However despite advances at the current pace the world will not meet the MDG target until 2026 Globally in 2013 37 million children aged one month to 4 years of age died down from 76 million in 1990 About half of child deaths occur in SubSaharan Africa Reduction of child mortality is the fourth of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals which were replaced in 2015 by the Sustainable Development Goals In 2015 an estimated 59 million children died before their fifth birthday 45 of them during the first 28 days of life Causes Further information Infant mortality The leading causes of death of children under five include Pneumonia Preterm birth Diarrhea Malaria Malnutrition Pneumonia diarrhea and malaria together are the cause of 3 out of every 10 child deaths before the age of 5 and nearly half of underfive deaths globally are attributable to undernutrition Prevention Further information Infant mortality Child survival is a field of public health concerned with reducing child mortality Child survival interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur which include diarrhea pneumonia malaria and neonatal conditions Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone an estimated 92 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes According to an estimate by UNICEF in 2008 one million child deaths could be prevented annually at a cost of US 1 billion per year an average of US 1000 for each child The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth Millennium Development Goal which focused on reducing child mortality by 23 of children under five before the year 2015 Many countries are now devoted to the child survival interventions as a way of reducing the child mortality In ACP countries European commission EC is intervening to with funds and technical capacity to assist the ACP countries reinforce their immunisation services through a project called EUPRIME which was a baby of cotonou agreement The overall aim of the project is to reduce the impact and incidence of vaccines preventable diseases VPDs in countries of intervention Lowcost interventions Twothirds of child deaths are preventable Most of the children who die each year could be saved by lowtech evidencebased costeffective measures such as vaccines antibiotics micronutrient supplementation insecticidetreated bed nets improved family care and breastfeeding practices and oral rehydration therapy Empowering women removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality In developing countries child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent Proven costeffective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year Immunization interventions still do not reach 30 million children despite success in immunizations in reducing polio tetanus and measles Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year Vitamin A supplementation costs only 002 cents for each capsule and given 23 times a year will prevent blindness and death Although vitamin A supplementation saved an estimated 23 million lives between 1999 and 2004 only half of young children in poor countries receive these treatments Between 250000 and 500000 children become blind every year with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months Oral rehydration therapy ORT has helped to reduce diarrhea deaths by half saving an estimated 1 million lives annually yet more than 2 million children still die from diarrhearelated causes each year Essential newborn care including immunizing mothers against tetanus ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth providing necessary warmth and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding immunization and treatment of infections with antibiotics could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually Improved sanitation and access to clean drinking water can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea Over 40 percent of the worlds population does not have access to basic sanitation and more than one billion people use unsafe sources of drinking water Efforts Agencies promoting and implementing child survival activities worldwide include UNICEF and nongovernmental organizations major child survival donors worldwide include the World Bank the British Governments Department for International Development the Canadian International Development Agency and the United States Agency for International Development In the United States most nongovernmental child survival agencies belong to the CORE Group a coalition working through collaborative action to save the lives of young children in the worlds poorest countries Epidemiology The under5 mortality rate is the number of children who die by the age of five per thousand live births per year In 2015 the world average was 43 43 down from 91 91 in 1990 This is equivalent to nearly 6 million children less than five years old dying in 2015 Variation The average was 6 in developed countries and 50 in developing countries including 92 in SubSaharan Africa The highest rate in the world was 167 in Angola Likewise there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries According to a Save the Children paper children from the poorest households in India are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households SubSaharan Africa the region with the highest rate of child mortality lowered its underfive mortality rate by 48 since 1990 All 12 countries with an underfive mortality rate of 100 or more deaths per 1000 live births are in subSaharan Africa and 10 of these are in West and Central Africa On average 1 out of every 11 children born in subSaharan Africa dies before age 5 This is nearly 15 times the average The child survival rate of nations varies with factors such as fertility rate and income distribution the change in distribution shows a strong correlation between child survival and income distribution as well as fertility rate where increasing child survival allows the average income to increase as well as the average fertility rate to decrease See also List of countries by infant mortality rate References External
