 A biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels power heat and valueadded chemicals from biomass The biorefinery concept is analogous to todays petroleum refinery which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum The International Energy Agency Bioenergy Task 42 on Biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of biobased products food feed chemicals materials and bioenergy biofuels power andor heat By producing multiple products a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock Some researcher have considered the exploration of a biorefinery as a practical method of improving the economic performance of standalone biomass to bioenergy system since biochemicals are produced A biorefinery could for example produce one or several lowvolume but highvalue chemical or nutraceutical products and a lowvalue but highvolume liquid transportation fuel such as biodiesel or bioethanol see also alcohol fuel At the same time generating electricity and process heat through combined heat and power CHP technology for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility The highvalue products increase profitability the highvolume fuel helps meet energy needs and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from traditional power plant facilities Although some facilities exist that can be called biorefineries the biorefinery has yet to be fully realized Future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from petroleum Examples The fully operational Blue Marble Energy company has multiple biorefineries located in Odessa WA and Missoula MT Canadas first Integrated Biorefinery developed on anaerobic digestion technology by Himark BioGas is located in Hairy Hill Alberta The Biorefinery utilizes Source Separated Organics from the metro Edmonton region Open Pen Feedlot Manure and Food Processing Waste Several potential biorefinery examples have been proposed starting from feedstocks such as tobacco flax straw and the residues from the production of bioethanol Biorefineries have also been proposed to gather as much materials from trees ie cellulose hemicellulose lignine lipids as possible Chemrecs technology for black liquor gasification and production of secondgeneration biofuels such as biomethanol or BioDME is integrated with a host pulp mill and utilizes a major sulfate or sulfite process waste product as feedstock See also Renewable energy portal Energy portal Biofuels Biomass Bioplastic Carbon neutrality Combined heat and power CHP Gasification Renewable energy commercialization References The first comprehensive and conceptual work on biorefineries should be cited as a reference B Kamm PG Gruber M Kamm Edts Biorefieries industrial processes and products Weinheim  WileyVCH 2006 The work of IEA Bioenergy Task 42 has recently been reviews by E de Jong G Jungmeter Biorefinerie Concepts in Comparison to Petrochemical Refineries InA Pandey R Höfer M Taherzadeh K Madhavan Nampoothiri C Larroche Edts Industrial Biorefineries and White Biotechnology Amsterdam Oxford Waltham  Elsevier 2015 pp 33 External links Tactical Biorefinery Saccharification Biosynergy Biorefinery from biomass AqueousPhase Reforming Wisconsin Biorefining Development Initiative Biorefinery Film Active Biorefinery Facilities
