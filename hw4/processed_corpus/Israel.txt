United Nations General Assembly adopted a Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine This specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and an area of Jerusalem which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948 That day David BenGurion the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel to be known as the State of Israel which would start to function from the termination of the mandate The

formally adopted the name State of Israel Medinat Yisrael after other proposed historical and religious names including Eretz Israel the Land of Israel Zion and Judea were considered and rejected In the early weeks of independence the government chose the term Israeli to denote a citizen of Israel with the formal announcement made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett The names Land of Israel and Children of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively The name Israel Standard Yisraʾel Isrāʾīl Septuagint Greek Ἰσραήλ Israēl ElGod persistsrules though after Hosea 124 often interpreted as struggle with God in these phrases refers to the patriarch Jacob who according to the Hebrew Bible was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord Jacobs twelve sons became the ancestors of the Israelites also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Children of Israel Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations lasting 430 years until Moses a greatgreat grandson of Jacob led the Israelites back into Canaan during the Exodus The earliest known archaeological artifact to mention the word Israel as a collective is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt dated to the late 13th century BCE The area is also known as the Holy Land being holy for all Abrahamic religions including Judaism Christianity Islam and the Baháí Faith From 1920 the whole region was known as Palestine under British Mandate until the Israeli Declaration of Independence of 1948 Through the centuries the territory was known by a variety of other names including Canaan Djahy Samaria Judea Yehud Iudaea CoeleSyria Syria Palaestina and Southern Syria History Main article History of Israel Prehistory Further information Prehistory of the Levant The oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern Israel dating to 15 million years ago was found in Ubeidiya near the Sea of Galilee Other notable Paleolithic sites include caves Tabun Qesem and Manot The oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside Africa are the Skhul and Qafzeh hominids who lived in northern Israel 120000 years ago Around 10th millennium BCE the Natufian culture existed in the area Antiquity Main article History of ancient Israel and Judah Further information Israelites Kingdom of Israel united monarchy Kingdom of Israel Samaria and Kingdom of Judah The notion of the Land of Israel known in Hebrew as Eretz Yisrael has been important and sacred to the Jewish people since Biblical times According to the Torah God promised the land to the three Patriarchs of the Jewish people On the basis of scripture the period of the three Patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millennium BCE The first record of the name Israel as ysrỉꜣr occurs in the Merneptah Stele erected for Egyptian Pharaoh Merneptah c 1209 BCE Israel is laid waste and his seed is not This Israel was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony but an ethnic group rather than an organised state The Merneptah Stele is one of four known contemporary inscriptions from antiquity containing the name of Israel the others being the Tel Dan Stele the Mesha Stele and the Kurkh Monolith The name appears much earlier as a personal name in material from Ebla Modern scholars see Israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of Canaan McNutt says It is probably safe to assume that sometime during Iron Age I a population began to identify itself as Israelite differentiating itself from the Canaanites through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage an emphasis on family history and genealogy and religion Ancestors of the Israelites may have included Semites native to Canaan and the Sea Peoples The archaeological evidence indicates a society of villagelike centres but with more limited resources and a small population Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400 which lived by farming and herding and were largely selfsufficient economic interchange was prevalent Writing was known and available for recording even in small sites The first Kingdom of Israel was established around the 11th century BCE Subsequent Israelite kingdoms and states ruled intermittently over the next four hundred years and are known from various extrabiblical sources Around 930 BCE the kingdom split into a southern Kingdom of Judah and a northern Kingdom of Israel From the middle of the 8th century BCE Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding NeoAssyrian Empire Under TiglathPileser III it first split Israels territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital Samaria 722 BCE An Israelite revolt 724–722 BCE was crushed after the siege and capture of Samaria by the Assyrian king Sargon II Sargons son Sennacherib tried and failed to conquer Judah Assyrian records say he leveled 46 walled cities and besieged Jerusalem leaving after receiving extensive tribute In 586 BCE King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon conquered Judah According to the Hebrew Bible he destroyed Solomons Temple and exiled the Jews to Babylon The defeat was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles In 538 BCE Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon and took over its empire Cyrus issued a proclamation granting subjugated nations including the people of Judah religious freedom for the original text which corroborates the biblical narrative only in very broad terms see the Cyrus Cylinder According to the Hebrew Bible 50000 Judeans led by Zerubbabel returned to Judah and rebuilt the temple A second group of 5000 led by Ezra and Nehemiah returned to Judah in 456 BCE although nonJews wrote to Cyrus to try to prevent their return Classical period Main article Second Temple period Further information Hasmonean dynasty Herodian dynasty and Jewish–Roman wars With successive Persian rule the autonomous province Yehud Medinata was gradually developing back into urban society largely dominated by Judeans The Greek conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest Incorporated into Ptolemaic and finally Seleucid empires the southern Levant was heavily hellenized building the tensions between Judeans and Greeks The conflict erupted in 167 BCE with the Maccabean Revolt which succeeded in establishing an independent Hasmonean Kingdom in Judah which later expanded over much of modern Israel as the Seleucids gradually lost control in the region The Roman Empire invaded the region in 63 BCE first taking control of Syria and then intervening in the Hasmonean Civil War The struggle between proRoman and proParthian factions in Judea eventually led to the installation of Herod the Great and consolidation of the Herodian kingdom as a vassal Judean state of Rome With the decline of the Herodian dynasty Judea transformed into a Roman province became the site of a violent struggle of Jews against GrecoRomans culminating in the Jewish–Roman wars ending in widescale destruction expulsions and genocide Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE Nevertheless there was a continuous small Jewish presence and Galilee became its religious center The Mishnah and part of the Talmud central Jewish texts were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem The region came to be populated predominantly by GrecoRomans on the coast and Samaritans in the hillcountry Christianity was gradually evolving over Roman paganism when the area stood under Byzantine rule Through the 5th and 6th centuries the dramatic events of the repeated Samaritan revolts reshaped the land with massive destruction to Byzantine Christian and Samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population After the Persian conquest and the installation of a shortlived Jewish Commonwealth in 614 CE the Byzantine Empire reconquered the country in 628 Middle Ages and modern history Further information History of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages Muslim history in Palestine and Old Yishuv In 634–641 CE the region including Jerusalem was conquered by the Arabs who had just recently adopted Islam Control of the region transferred between the Rashidun Caliphs Umayyads Abbasids Fatimids Seljuks Crusaders and Ayyubids throughout the next three centuries During the siege of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099 the Jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the Crusaders When the city fell about 60000 people were massacred including 6000 Jews seeking refuge in a synagogue At this time a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state there were Jewish communities all over the country Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem Tiberias Ramleh Ashkelon Caesarea and Gaza According to Albert of Aachen the Jewish residents of Haifa were the main fighting force of the city and mixed with Saracen Fatimid troops they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the Crusader fleet and land army However Joshua Prawer expressed doubt over the story noting that Albert did not attend the Crusades and that such a prominent role for the Jews is not mentioned by any other source In 1165 Maimonides visited Jerusalem and prayed on the Temple Mount in the great holy house In 1141 the SpanishJewish poet Yehuda Halevi issued a call for Jews to migrate to the Land of Israel a journey he undertook himself In 1187 Sultan Saladin founder of the Ayyubid dynasty defeated the Crusaders in the Battle of Hattin and subsequently captured Jerusalem and almost all of Palestine In time Saladin issued a proclamation inviting Jews to return and settle in Jerusalem and according to Judah alHarizi they did From the day the Arabs took Jerusalem the Israelites inhabited it AlHarizi compared Saladins decree allowing Jews to reestablish themselves in Jerusalem to the one issued by the Persian king Cyrus the Great over 1600 years earlier In 1211 the Jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from France and England among them Rabbi Samson ben Abraham of Sens Nachmanides the 13thcentury Spanish rabbi and recognised leader of Jewry greatly praised the land of Israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all Jews He wrote If the gentiles wish to make peace we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms but as for the land we shall not leave it in their hands nor in the hands of any nation not in any generation In 1260 control passed to the Mamluk sultans of Egypt The country was located between the two centres of Mamluk power Cairo and Damascus and only saw some development along the postal road connecting the two cities Jerusalem although left without the protection of any city walls since 1219 also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the AlAqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount In 1266 the Mamluk Sultan Baybars converted the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron into an exclusive Islamic sanctuary and banned Christians and Jews from entering which previously would be able to enter it for a fee The ban remained in place until Israel took control of the building in 1967 In 1470 Isaac b Meir Latif arrived from Italy and counted 150 Jewish families in Jerusalem Thanks to Joseph Saragossi who had arrived in the closing years of the 15th century Safed and its environs had developed into the largest concentration of Jews in Palestine With the help of the Sephardic immigration from Spain the Jewish population had increased to 10000 by the early 16th century In 1516 the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire it remained under Turkish rule until the end of the First World War when Britain defeated the Ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former Ottoman Syria In 1920 the territory was divided between Britain and France under the mandate system and the Britishadministered area which included modern day Israel was named Mandatory Palestine Zionism and British mandate Further information Zionism Yishuv Mandatory Palestine and Balfour Declaration Since the existence of the earliest Jewish diaspora many Jews have aspired to return to Zion and the Land of Israel though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute The hopes and yearnings of Jews living in exile are an important theme of the Jewish belief system After the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 some communities settled in Palestine During the 16th century Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities—Jerusalem Tiberias Hebron and Safed—and in 1697 Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led a group of 1500 Jews to Jerusalem In the second half of the 18th century Eastern European opponents of Hasidism known as the Perushim settled in Palestine Therefore I believe that a wonderous generation of Jews will spring into existence The Maccabaeans will rise again Let me repeat once more my opening words The Jews wish to have a State and they shall have one We shall live at last as free men on our own soil and die peacefully in our own home The world will be freed by our liberty enriched by our wealth magnified by our greatness And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare will react with beneficent force for the good of humanity Theodor Herzl 1896  A Jewish State Wikisource   scan The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottomanruled Palestine known as the First Aliyah began in 1881 as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice AustroHungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel thus offering a solution to the socalled Jewish question of the European states in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time In 1896 Herzl published Der Judenstaat The Jewish State offering his vision of a future Jewish state the following year he presided over the First Zionist Congress The Second Aliyah 1904–14 began after the Kishinev pogrom some 40000 Jews settled in Palestine although nearly half of them left eventually Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews although the Second Aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement During World War I British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent the Balfour Declaration of 1917 to Baron Rothschild Walter Rothschild 2nd Baron Rothschild a leader of the British Jewish community that stated that Britain intended for the creation of a Jewish national home within the Palestinian Mandate In 1918 the Jewish Legion a group primarily of Zionist volunteers assisted in the British conquest of Palestine Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah meaning The Defense in Hebrew from which the Irgun and Lehi or the Stern Gang paramilitary groups later split off In 1922 the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians The population of the area at this time was predominantly Arab and Muslim with Jews accounting for about 11 and Arab Christians at about 95 of the population The Third 1919–23 and Fourth Aliyahs 1924–29 brought an additional 100000 Jews to Palestine The rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936–39 during which the British Mandate authorities alongside the Zionist militias of Haganah and Irgun killed 5032 Arabs and wounded 14760 resulting in over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939 With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine By the end of World War II the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33 of the total population After World War II Further information Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and Israeli Declaration of Independence After World War II Britain found itself in intense conflict with the Jewish community over Jewish immigration limits as well as continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule At the same time hundreds of thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in Europe The Yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to Palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps in Atlit and Cyprus by the British On 22 July 1946 Irgun attacked the British administrative headquarters for Palestine which was housed in the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem A total of 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured The hotel was the site of the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Palestine and Transjordan The attack initially had the approval of the Haganah It was conceived as a response to Operation Agatha a series of widespread raids including one on the Jewish Agency conducted by the British authorities and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era It was characterized as one of the most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century In 1947 the British government announced it would withdraw from Palestine stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews On 15 May 1947 the General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations resolved that the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine be created to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine In the Report of the Committee dated 3 September 1947 to the General Assembly the majority of the Committee in Chapter VI proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with an independent Arab State an independent Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem the last to be under an International Trusteeship System On 29 November 1947 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 II recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the Committee in the report of 3 September The Jewish Agency which was the recognized representative of the Jewish community accepted the plan The Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition On the following day 1 December 1947 the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a threeday strike and Arab gangs began attacking Jewish targets The Jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out but in early April 1948 moved onto the offensive The Arab Palestinian economy collapsed and 250000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled On 14 May 1948 the day before the expiration of the British Mandate David BenGurion the head of the Jewish Agency declared the establishment of a Jewish state in EretzIsrael to be known as the State of Israel The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term EretzIsrael Land of Israel The following day the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt Syria Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been British Mandatory Palestine launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War contingents from Yemen Morocco Saudi Arabia and Sudan joined the war The apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state at inception and some Arab leaders talked about driving the Jews into the sea According to Benny Morris Jews felt that the invading Arab armies aimed to slaughter the Jews The Arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed After a year of fighting a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders known as the Green Line were established Jordan annexed what became known as the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip The United Nations estimated that more than 700000 Palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing Israeli forces during the conflict—what would become known in Arabic as the Nakba catastrophe Early years of the State of Israel Further information Arab–Israeli conflict Israel was admitted as a member of the United Nations by majority vote on 11 May 1949 Both Israel and Jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the British acted as a brake on the Jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging British interests in Egypt In the early years of the state the Labor Zionist movement led by Prime Minister David BenGurion dominated Israeli politics The Kibbutzim or collective farming communities played a pivotal role in establishing the new state Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the nongovernment sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet Institution for Illegal Immigration Both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe where the lives of Jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 1953 The immigration was in accordance with the One Million Plan The immigrants came for differing reasons Some believed in a Zionist ideology or did it for the promise of a better life in Israel while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled An influx of Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700000 to 1400000 By 1958 the population of Israel rose to two million Between 1948 and 1970 approximately 1150000 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel Some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot by 1952 over 200000 people were living in these tent cities Jews of European background were often treated more favorably than Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often redesignated for the former with the result that Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer Tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day During this period food clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period The need to solve the crisis led BenGurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust During the 1950s Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians mainly from the Egyptianoccupied Gaza Strip leading to several Israeli counterraids In 1956 Great Britain and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal which the Egyptians had nationalized The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping together with the growing amount of Fedayeen attacks against Israels southern population and recent Arab grave and threatening statements prompted Israel to attack Egypt Israel joined a secret alliance with Great Britain and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the United Nations in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the Red Sea via the Straits of Tiran and the Canal The war known as the Suez Crisis resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration In the early 1960s Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial The trial had a major impact on public awareness of the Holocaust Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction by an Israeli civilian court Since 1964 Arab countries concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the Jordan River into the coastal plain had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources provoking tensions between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Lebanon on the other Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognize Israel and called for its destruction By 1966 IsraeliArab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces In May 1967 Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel expelled UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957 and blocked Israels access to the Red Sea Other Arab states mobilized their forces Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and on 5 June launched a preemptive strike against Egypt Jordan Syria and Iraq responded and attacked Israel In a SixDay War Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank defeated Egypt and captured the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula and defeated Syria and captured the Golan Heights Jerusalems boundaries were enlarged incorporating East Jerusalem and the 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories Following the 1967 war and the three nos resolution of the Arab League during the 1967–1970 War of Attrition Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories in Israel proper and around the world Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestinian Liberation Organization PLO established in 1964 which initially committed itself to armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland In the late 1960s and early 1970s Palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre a bombing and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon On 6 October 1973 as Jews were observing Yom Kippur the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights that opened the Yom Kippur War The war ended on 25 October with Israel successfully repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but having suffered over 2500 soldiers killed in a war which collectively took 10–35000 lives in about 20 days An internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war but public anger forced Prime Minister Golda Meir to resign In July 1976 an airliner was hijacked during its flight from Israel to France by Palestinian guerrillas and landed at Entebbe Uganda Israeli commandos carried out an operation in which 102 out of 106 Israeli hostages were successfully rescued Further conflict and peace process Further information Israeli–Palestinian peace process The 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begins Likud party took control from the Labor Party Later that year Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state In the two years that followed Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords 1978 and the Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty 1979 In return Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip On 11 March 1978 a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road massacre Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River Most PLO fighters withdrew but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over The PLO soon resumed its policy of attacks against Israel In the next few years the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground Meanwhile Begins government provided incentives for Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area The Basic Law Jerusalem Capital of Israel passed in 1980 was believed by some to reaffirm Israels 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein The position of the majority of UN member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by Israel to settle its citizens in the West Bank and impose its laws and administration on East Jerusalem are illegal and have no validity In 1981 Israel annexed the Golan Heights although annexation was not recognized internationally Israels population diversity expanded in the 1980s and 1990s Several waves of Ethiopian Jews immigrated to Israel since the 1980s while between 1990 and 1994 immigration from the postSoviet states increased Israels population by twelve percent On 7 June 1981 the Israeli air force destroyed Iraqs sole nuclear reactor under construction just outside Baghdad in order to impede Iraqs nuclear weapons program Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel In the first six days of fighting the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians An Israeli government inquiry—the Kahan Commission—would later hold Begin Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre In 1985 Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000 from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah The First Intifada a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule broke out in 1987 with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Over the following six years the Intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation More than a thousand people were killed in the violence During the 1991 Gulf War the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi Scud missile attacks against Israel Despite public outrage Israel heeded American calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war In 1992 Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israels neighbors The following year Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO signed the Oslo Accords which gave the Palestinian National Authority the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip The PLO also recognized Israels right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism In 1994 the Israel–Jordan peace treaty was signed making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and checkpoints and the deterioration of economic conditions Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by Palestinian suicide attacks In November 1995 while leaving a peace rally Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir a farrightwing Jew who opposed the Accords Under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu at the end of the 1990s Israel withdrew from Hebron and signed the Wye River Memorandum giving greater control to the Palestinian National Authority Ehud Barak elected Prime Minister in 1999 began the new millennium by withdrawing forces from Southern Lebanon and conducting negotiations with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and US President Bill Clinton at the 2000 Camp David Summit During the summit Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state The proposed state included the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90 of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks After a controversial visit by Likud leader Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount the Second Intifada began Some commentators contend that the uprising was preplanned by Arafat due to the collapse of peace talks Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 special election During his tenure Sharon carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and also spearheaded the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier ending the Intifada By this time 1100 Israelis had been killed mostly in suicide bombings The Palestinian fatalities from 2000 to 2008 reached 4791 killed by Israeli security forces 44 killed by Israeli civilians and 609 killed by Palestinians In July 2006 a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israels northern border communities and a crossborder abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the monthlong Second Lebanon War On 6 September 2007 the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria At the end of 2008 Israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed The 2008–09 Gaza War lasted three weeks and ended after Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire Hamas announced its own ceasefire with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings Despite neither the rocket launchings nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped the fragile ceasefire remained in order In what Israel described as a response to more than a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities Israel began an operation in Gaza on 14 November 2012 lasting eight days Israel started another operation in Gaza

longitudes 34° and 36° E The sovereign territory of Israel according to the demarcation lines of the 1949 Armistice Agreements and excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 SixDay War is approximately 20770 square kilometers 8019 sq mi in area of which two percent is water However Israel is so narrow that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country The total area under Israeli law including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights is 22072 square kilometers 8522 sq mi and the total area under Israeli control including the militarycontrolled and partially Palestiniangoverned territory of the West Bank is 27799 square kilometers 10733 sq mi Despite its small size Israel is home to a variety of geographic features from the Negev desert in the south to the inland fertile Jezreel Valley mountain ranges of the Galilee Carmel and toward the Golan in the north The Israeli coastal plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to most of the nations population East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley which forms a small part of the 6500kilometer 4039 mi Great Rift Valley The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea the lowest point on the surface of the Earth Further south is the Arabah ending with the Gulf of Eilat part of the Red Sea Unique to Israel and the Sinai Peninsula are makhteshim or erosion cirques The largest makhtesh in the world is Ramon Crater in the Negev which measures 40 by 8 kilometers 25 by 5 mi A report on the environmental status of the Mediterranean Basin states that Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin Tectonics and seismicity Further information List of earthquakes in the Levant The Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform DSF fault system The DSF forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate while the Galilee West Bank Coastal Plain and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 The deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of Mw74 The most catastrophic earthquakes we know of occurred in 31 BCE 363 749 and 1033 CE that is every ca 400 years on average Destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years While stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquakesafe as of 2007 the majority of the buildings in Israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as 50000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were expected to collapse if exposed to a strong quake Given the fragile political situation of the Middle East region and the presence there of major holy sites a quake reaching magnitude 7 on the Richter scale could have dire consequences for world peace Climate Temperatures in Israel vary widely especially during the winter Coastal areas such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and long hot summers The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev has a semiarid climate with hot summers cool winters and fewer rainy days than the Mediterranean climate The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have desert climate with very hot and dry summers and mild winters with few days of rain The highest temperature in the continent of Asia 540 °C or 1292 °F was recorded in 1942 at Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan river valley At the other extreme mountainous regions can be windy cold and areas at elevation of 750 meters or more same elevation as Jerusalem will usually receive at least one snowfall each year

considerable sunlight available for solar energy making Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita practically every house uses solar panels for water heating Four different phytogeographic regions exist in Israel due to the countrys location between the temperate and the tropical zones bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east For this reason the flora and fauna of Israel is extremely diverse There are 2867 known species of plants found in Israel Of these at least 253 species are introduced and nonnative There are 380 Israeli nature reserves Tiberias and the Sea of Galilee Field of Anemone coronaria national flower of Israel Makhtesh Ramon a type of crater unique to Israel and the Sinai Peninsula Snow in Galilee Flowers of Israel

Criticism of the Israeli government Israel operates under a parliamentary system as a democratic republic with universal suffrage A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister—usually this is the chair of the largest party The prime minister is the head of government and head of the cabinet Israel is governed by a 120member parliament known as the Knesset Membership of the Knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties with a 325 electoral threshold which in practice has resulted in coalition governments Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years but unstable coalitions or a noconfidence vote by the Knesset can dissolve a government earlier The Basic Laws of Israel function as an uncodified constitution In 2003 the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws The president of Israel is head of state with limited and largely ceremonial duties Israel has no official religion but the definition of the state as Jewish and democratic creates a strong connection with Judaism as well as a conflict between state law and religious law Interaction between the political parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the British Mandate Legal system Main articles Judiciary of Israel and Israeli law Israel has a threetier court system At the lowest level are magistrate courts situated in most cities across the country Above them are district courts serving as both appellate courts and courts of first instance they are situated in five of Israels six districts The third and highest tier is the Supreme Court located in Jerusalem it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the High Court of Justice In the latter role the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance allowing individuals both citizens and noncitizens to petition against the decisions of state authorities Although Israel supports the goals of the International Criminal Court it has not ratified the Rome Statute citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality Israels legal system combines three legal traditions English common law civil law and Jewish law It is based on the principle of stare decisis precedent and is an adversarial system where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court Court cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries Marriage and divorce are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts Jewish Muslim Druze and Christian The election of judges is carried out by a committee of two Knesset members three Supreme Court justices two Israeli Bar members and two ministers one of which Israels justice minister is the committees chairman The

Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel Districts are further divided into fifteen subdistricts known as nafot נפות singular nafa which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions Israelioccupied territories Main article Israelioccupied territories In 1967 as a result of the SixDay War Israel captured and occupied the West Bank including East Jerusalem the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty Between 1982 and 2000 Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon in what was known as the Security Belt Since Israels capture of these territories Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them except Lebanon Israel has applied civilian law to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship The West Bank outside of the Israeli settlements within the territory has remained under direct military rule and Palestinians in this area cannot become Israeli citizens Israel withdrew its military forces and dismantled the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip as part of its disengagement from Gaza though it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be null and void and continues to view the territories as occupied The International Court of Justice principal judicial organ of the United Nations asserted in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier that the lands captured by Israel in the SixDay War including East Jerusalem are occupied territory The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians as Israel views it as its sovereign territory as well as part of its capital Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 which emphasises the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states a principle known as Land for peace The West Bank was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950 following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO The population are mainly Palestinians including refugees of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War From their occupation in 1967 until 1993 the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration Since the Israel–PLO letters of recognition most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority and only partial Israeli military control although Israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest In response to increasing attacks during the Second Intifada the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier When completed approximately 13 of the barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87 inside the West Bank The Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by Israel after 1967 In 2005 as part of Israels unilateral disengagement plan Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory Israel does not consider the Gaza Strip to be occupied territory and declared it a foreign territory That view has been disputed by numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the United Nations Following the 2007 Battle of Gaza when Hamas assumed power in the Gaza Strip Israel tightened its control of the Gaza crossings along its border as well as by sea and air and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian Gaza has a border with Egypt and an agreement between Israel the European Union and the PA governed how border crossing would take place it was monitored by European observers

former prime minister Tony Blairs efforts for a two state resolution By 2007 Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to the Israeli state and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors Israel is included in the European Unions European Neighbourhood Policy ENP which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer Although Turkey and Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations until 1991 Turkey has cooperated with the Jewish state since its recognition of Israel in 1949 Turkeys ties to the other Muslimmajority nations in the region have at times resulted in pressure from Arab and Muslim states to temper its relationship with Israel Relations between Turkey and Israel took a downturn after the 2008–09 Gaza War and Israels raid of the Gaza flotilla Relations between Greece and Israel have improved since 1995 due to the decline of IsraeliTurkish relations The two countries have a defense cooperation agreement and in 2010 the Israeli Air Force hosted Greeces Hellenic Air
