 Lifelong learning is the ongoing voluntary and selfmotivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons Therefore it not only enhances social inclusion active citizenship and personal development but also selfsustainability as well as competitiveness and employability Evolved from the term lifelong learners created by Leslie Watkins and used by Professor Clint Taylor CSULA and Superintendent for the Temple City Unified School Districts mission statement in 1993 the term recognizes that learning is not confined to childhood or the classroom but takes place throughout life and in a range of situations Allen Tough 1979 Canadian educator and researcher asserts that almost 70 of learning projects are selfplanned During the last fifty years constant scientific and technological innovation and change has had a profound effect on learning needs and styles Learning can no longer be divided into a place and time to acquire knowledge school and a place and time to apply the knowledge acquired the workplace Instead learning can be seen as something that takes place on an ongoing basis from our daily interactions with others and with the world around us It can take the form of formal learning or informal learning or selfdirected learning Learning economy Lifelong learning is being recognized by traditional colleges and universities as valid in addition to degree attainment Some learning is accomplished in segments or interest categories and can still be valuable to the individual and community The economic impact of educational institutions at all levels will continue to be significant into the future as formal courses of study continue and interestbased subjects are pursued The institutions produce educated citizens who buy goods and services in the community and the education facilities and personnel generate economic activity during the operations and institutional activities Similar to health facilities educational institutions are among the top employers in many cities and towns of the world Whether brickandmortar institutions or online schools there is a great economic impact worldwide from learning including lifelong learning for all age groups The lifelong learners including persons with academic or professional credentials tend to find higherpaying occupations leaving monetary cultural and entrepreneurial impressions on communities according to educator Cassandra B Whyte Contexts Although the term is widely used in a variety of contexts its meaning is often unclear A learning approach that can be used to define lifelong learning is heutagogy There are several established contexts for lifelong learning beyond traditional brick and mortar schooling Home schooling involves learning to learn or the development of informal learning patterns Adult education or the acquisition of formal qualifications or work and leisure skills later in life Continuing education which often describes extension or notforcredit courses offered by higher education institutions Knowledge work which includes professional development and onthejob training Personal learning environments or selfdirected learning using a range of sources and tools including online applications Elearning is available at most colleges and universities or to individuals learning independently There are even online courses being offered for free by many institutions One new 2008 and beyond expression of lifelong learning is the massive open online course a MOOC in which a teacher or team offers a syllabus and some direction for the participation of hundreds sometimes thousands of learners Most MOOCs do not offer typical credit for courses taken which is why they are interesting and useful examples of lifelong learning Emerging technologies Lifelong learning is defined as all learning activity undertaken throughout life with the aim of improving knowledge skills and competences within a personal civic social andor employmentrelated perspective It is often considered learning that occurs after the formal education years of childhood where learning is instructordriven – pedagogical and into adulthood where the learning is individuallydriven – andragogical It is sought out naturally through life experiences as the learner seeks to gain knowledge for professional or personal reasonsKnowledge results from the combination of grasping experience and transforming it Kolb 1984 41 The concept of lifelong learning has become of vital importance with the emergence of new technologies that change how we receive and gather information collaborate with others and communicate Assistive technology As technology rapidly changes individuals must adapt and learn to meet everyday demands However throughout life an individuals functional capacities may also change Assistive technologies are also important considerations under the umbrella of emerging technology and lifelong learning Access to informal and formal learning opportunities for individuals with disabilities may be dependent upon low and high tech assistive technology Web 20 The emergence of Web 20 technologies has great potential to support lifelong learning endeavors allowing for informal justintime daytoday learning Constant change is emerging as the new normal In order to survive and thrive organizations and individuals must be able to adjust and enhance their knowledge and skills to meet evolving needs This means the most important thing someone can learn is how to learn An understanding of web 20 tools is critical to keeping up with a changing world and the information explosion Workplace learning The professions in particular are recognizing the importance of developing practitioners to be lifelong learners Nowadays formal training is only a beginning knowledge is accumulating at such a fast rate that one must continue to learn to be effective Williams 2001 Indeed most professions mandate that their members continue learning in order to maintain their license to practice Merriam Caffarella Baumgartner 2007 Having said this what are the characteristics or skills that a lifelong learner will need to develop Reflective learning and critical thinking can help a learner to become more selfreliant through learning how to learn thus making them better able to direct manage and control their own learning process Candy 1990 Sipe 1995 studied experimentally open teachers and found that they valued selfdirected learning collaboration reflection and challenge risk taking in their learning was seen as an opportunity not a threat Dunlap and Grabinger 2003 make the case that in order to prepare students in higher education to be lifelong learners we must develop their capacity for selfdirection metacognition awareness and a disposition toward learning Merriam Caffarella Baumgartner 2007 Metacognition While the study of metacognition originally gave educational psychologists insights into what differentiated successful students from their less successful peers it is increasingly being used to inform teaching that aims to make students more aware of their learning processes and show them how to regulate those processes for more effective learning throughout their lives Educators can employ Cognitive Strategy Instruction CSI as a means to help learners develop their metacognition Again learners who are better equipped to create learning strategies for themselves will have more success in achieving their cognitive goals As lifelong learning is lifelong lifewide voluntary and selfmotivated learning to learn that is learning how to recognize learning strategies and monitor and evaluate learning is a precondition for lifelong learning Metacognition is an essential first step in developing lifelong learning In practice In India and elsewhere the University of the Third Age U3A provides an example of the almost spontaneous emergence of autonomous learning groups accessing the expertise of their own members in the pursuit of knowledge and shared experience No prior qualifications and no subsequent certificates feature in this approach to learning for its own sake and as participants testify engagement in this type of learning in later life can indeed prolong active life In Sweden the successful concept of study circles an idea launched almost a century ago still represents a large portion of the adult education provision The concept has since spread and for instance is a common practice in Finland as well A study circle is one of the most democratic forms of a learning environment that has been created There are no teachers and the group decides on what content will be covered scope will be used as well as a delivery method Sometimes lifelong learning aims to provide educational opportunities outside standard educational systems – which can be costprohibitive if it is available at all On the other hand formal administrative units devoted to this discipline exist in a number of universities For example the Academy of Lifelong Learning is an administrative unit within the Universitywide Professional and Continuing Studies unit at the University of Delaware Another example is the Jagiellonian University Extension Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego which is one of the most comprehensive Polish centers for lifelong learning open learning organizational learning community learning In recent years lifelong learning has been adopted in the UK as an umbrella term for postcompulsory education that falls outside of the UK higher education system – further education community education workbased learning and similar voluntary public sector and commercial settings Most colleges and universities in the United States encourage lifelong learning to nontraditional students Professional licensure and certification courses are also offered at many universities for instance for teachers social services providers and other professionals Some colleges even enable adults to earn credit for the collegelevel learning gained through work volunteer and other experiences Open and distance learning ODLis playing a vital role in lifelong learning Bangladesh Open University BOU is a great example of that BOU has 6 schools and is offering 23 formal and 19 non formal programs and students number is 378382 according to 201011 enrolment number Most of the courses of BOU are for Professional development and most of the students are professional people who are getting scope to study in flexible hours From BOU Profile Bangladesh Open University is the only public institution in the country that imparts education in distance mode In place of campus based teaching this university uses technology including electronic devices to reach people in different corners of the country The learner in this system is not restricted by time space or age A learner can think and learn at his own will at his own place and at any time whenever heshe feels free to learn In Canada the federal governments Lifelong Learning Plan allows Canadian residents to withdraw funds from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan to help pay for lifelong learning but the funds can only be used for formal learning programs at designated educational institutions See also Adult education Autonomous learning Brain fitness Community college Continuing
