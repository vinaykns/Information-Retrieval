 Carbon dioxide removal CDR methods refers to a number of technologies which reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Among such technologies are bioenergy with carbon capture and storage biochar direct air capture ocean fertilization and enhanced weathering CDR is a different approach than removing CO2 from the stack emissions of large fossil fuel point sources such as power stations The latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere As CDR removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere it creates negative emissions offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems airplanes and vehicle exhausts It is regarded by some as a form of climate engineering while other commentators describe it as a form of carbon capture and storage or extreme mitigation Whether CDR would satisfy common definitions of climate engineering or geoengineering usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken The likely need for CDR has been publicly expressed by a range of individuals and organizations involved with climate change issues including IPCC chief Rajendra Pachauri the UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres and the World Watch Institute Institutions with major programs focusing on CDR include the Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy at the Earth Institute Columbia University and the Climate Decision Making Center an international collaboration operated out of CarnegieMellon Universitys Department of Engineering and Public Policy The mitigation effectiveness of air capture is limited by societal investment land use availability of geologic reservoirs and leakage The reservoirs are estimated to be sufficient to for storing at least 545 GtC Storing 771 GtC would cause an 186 ppm atmospheric reduction In order to return the atmospheric CO2 content to 350 ppm we need atmospheric reduction of 50 ppm plus an additional 2 ppm per year of current emissions Methods Bioenergy with carbon capture storage Main article Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or BECCS uses biomass to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and carbon capture and storage technologies to concentrate and permanently store it in deep geological formations BECCS is currently as of October 2012 the only CDR technology deployed at full industrial scale with 550 000 tonnes CO2year in total capacity operating divided between three different facilities as of January 2012 The Imperial College London the UK Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research the Walker Institute for Climate System Research and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change issued a joint report on carbon dioxide removal technologies as part of the AVOID Avoiding dangerous climate change research program stating that Overall of the technologies studied in this report BECCS has the greatest maturity and there are no major practical barriers to its introduction into today’s energy system The presence of a primary product will support early deployment According to the OECD Achieving lower concentration targets 450 ppm depends significantly on the use of BECCS Biochar Main article Biochar Biochar is created by the pyrolysis of biomass and is under investigation as a method of carbon sequestration Biochar is a charcoal that is used for agricultural purposes which also aids in carbon sequestration the capture or hold of carbon It is created using a process called pyrolysis which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels What remains is a material known as char similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process thus the use of biomass Biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms most commonly plants or plant based material The offset of GHG emission if biochar were to be implemented would be a maximum of 12 This equates to about 106 metric tons of CO2 equivalents On a medium conservative level it would be 23 less than that at 82 metric tons A study done by the UK Biochar Research Center has stated that on a conservative level biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year With greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar the benefit would the storage of 59 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils Enhanced weathering Main article Enhanced weathering Enhanced weathering refers to chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques Examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are insitu carbonation of silicates Ultramafic rock for example has the potential to store thousands of years worth of CO2 emissions according to one estimate Ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement such as grinding dispersing and dissolving olivine limestone silicates or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and CO2 sequestration Enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of geoengineering options One example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the CarbFix project in Iceland Direct air capture Carbon dioxide can be removed from ambient air through chemical processes sequestered and stored One proposed method is by socalled artificial trees This concept proposed by climate scientist Wallace S Broecker and science writer Robert Kunzig imagines huge numbers of artificial trees around the world to remove ambient CO2 The technology is now being pioneered by Klaus Lackner a researcher at the Earth Institute Columbia University whose artificial tree technology can suck up to 1000 times more CO2 from the air than real trees can at a rate of about one ton of carbon per day if the artificial tree is approximately the size of an actual tree The CO2 would be captured in a filter and then removed from the filter and stored The chemistry used is a variant of that described below as it is based on sodium hydroxide However in a more recent design proposed by Klaus Lackner the process can be carried out at only 40 °C by using a polymerbased ion exchange resin which takes advantage of changes in humidity to prompt the release of captured CO2 instead of using a kiln This reduces the energy required to operate the process Another substance which can be used are Metalorganic frameworks or MOFs A special MOF has been made specifically for locking CO2 by Joeri Denayer In 2008 the Discovery Channel covered the work of David Keith of University of Calgary who built a tower 4 feet wide and 20 feet tall 12×61 meters with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in which comes out again at the top In the process about half the CO2 is removed from the air This device uses the chemical process described in detail below The system demonstrated on the Discovery Channel was a 190000th scale test system of the capture section the reagents are regenerated in a separate facility The main costs of a full plant will be the cost to build it and the energy input to regenerate the chemicals and produce a pure stream of CO2 To put this into perspective people in the US emit about 20 tonnes of CO2 per person annually In other words each person in the US would require a tower like the one featured by the Discovery Channel to remove this amount of CO2 from the air requiring an annual 2 megawatthours of electricity to operate it By comparison a refrigerator consumes about 12 megawatthours annually 2001 figures But by combining many small systems such as this into one large system the construction costs and energy use can be reduced It has been proposed that the Solar updraft tower to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used at the same time for amine gravity scrubbing of CO2 Some heat would be required to regenerate the amine A similar CO2 scrubber has also been built by Carbon Engineering Besides simply focusing on capturing the CO2 the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the CO2 for example in the production of fuels which would thus be carbonneutral Direct air capture has been proposed as a way of generating carbonneutral organic chemicals by harvesting the atmospheric compounds and then using them in the production and synthesis of polymers and fuels Finally the Swiss based Climeworks is currently building the first industrial scale direct air capturing plant in Hinwil Switzerland Starting in Mai 2017 the plant is going to scrub about 900 metric tons of CO2 per year using heat from a local waste incineration plant The CO2 should be sold to a local vegetable growing company Ocean fertilization Main article Ocean fertilization Ocean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere A number of techniques including fertilization by iron urea and phosphorus have been proposed Example CO2 scrubbing chemistry Main article Carbon dioxide scrubber Calcium oxide Calcium oxide quicklime will absorb CO2 from atmospheric air mixed with steam at 400 °C forming calcium carbonate and release it at 1000 °C This process proposed by A Steinfeld can be performed using renewable energy from thermal concentrated solar power Quicklime is made by heating limestone to release the CO2 within it Quicklime is mixed with sand for brick building as mortar where it hardens by absorption of CO2 Potassium Hydroxide Zeman and Lackner outlined a specific method of air capture using sodium hydroxide Carbon Engineering a Calgary Alberta firm founded in 2009 and partially funded by Bill Gates is developing a process to capture carbon dioxide using a solution of potassium hydroxide mixed with some water at their pilot plant They hope to create and sell synthetic fuels at a cost of 100 a ton Economic issues A crucial issue for CDR methods is their cost which differs substantially among the different technologies some of these are not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments The American Physical Society estimates the costs for direct air capture to be 600tonne with optimistic assumptions The IEA Greenhouse Gas RD Programme and Ecofys provides an estimate that 35 billion tonnes could be removed annually from the atmosphere with BECCS BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage at carbon prices as low as €50 per tonne while a report from Biorecro and the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute estimates costs below €100 per tonne for large scale BECCS deployment Risks problems and criticisms CDR is slow to act and requires a longterm political and engineering program to effect CDR is even slower to take effect on acidified oceans In a Business as usual concentration pathway the deep ocean will remain acidified for centuries and as a consequence many marine species are in danger of extinction See also Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS Climate change mitigation Climate change
