 An address is a collection of information presented in a mostly fixed format used to give the location of a building apartment or other structure or a plot of land generally using political boundaries and street names as references along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers Some addresses also contain special codes such as a postal code to make identification easier and aid in the routing of mail Functions Addresses have several functions providing a means of physically locating a building especially in a city where there are many buildings and streets identifying buildings as the end points of a postal system signalling social status as parameters in statistics collection especially in censustaking and the insurance industry addresses are the most accepted representation of a location Addresses may have drawbacks They are a nonstandardised means of representing a location They do not contain the coordinates of the location they represent History Further information House numbering § History Until the advent of modern postal systems around the 18th19th century most houses and buildings were not numbered Streets may have been named for landmarks such as a city gate or market or for the professions of their inhabitants In many cities in Asia most minor streets were never named This is still the case today in much of Japan A local postman would be familiar with the area and thus able to deliver mail but as postal systems developed it became necessary to number buildings to aid in mail delivery Current addressing schemes House numbering or naming Main article House numbering In most Englishspeaking countries the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in one direction along a street with odd numbers on one side often west or south or the lefthand side leading away from a main road and even numbers on the other side although there is significant variation on this basic pattern Many older towns and cities in the UK have up and down numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road and then sequentially back down the other side Cities in North America particularly those planned on a grid plan often incorporate block numbers quadrants explained below and cardinal directions into their street numbers so that in many such cities addresses roughly follow a Cartesian coordinate system Some other cities around the world have their own schemes Although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world it is also common for houses in the United Kingdom and Ireland to be identified by name rather than number especially in villages In these cases the street name will usually follow the house name Such an address might read Smith Cottage Frog Lane Barchester Barsetshire BZ9 9BA or Dunroamin Emo Co Laois Ireland fictional examples Quadrants In cities with Cartesiancoordinatebased addressing systems the streets that form the northsouth and eastwest dividing lines constitute the x and y axes of a Cartesian coordinate plane and thus divide the city into quadrants The quadrants are typically identified in the street names although the manner of doing so varies from city to city For example in one city all streets in the northeast quadrant may have NE prefixed or suffixed to their street names while in another the intersection of North Calvert Street and East 27th Street can be only in the northeast quadrant Streetnaming conventions Street names may follow a variety of themes In many North American cities such as San Francisco USA and Edmonton Alberta Canada streets are simply numbered sequentially across the street grid Washington DC has its numbered streets running northsouth and lettered or alphabetically named streets running eastwest while diagonal avenues are typically named after states In Salt Lake City and many other Utah cities streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks A similar system is in use in Detroit with the Mile Road System In some housing developments in North America and elsewhere street names may all follow the same theme for example bird species or start with the same letter Streets in Continental Europe the Middle East and Latin America are often named after famous people or significant dates Postal codes Postal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality Postal alternatives to physical addresses For privacy and other purposes postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing ones physical address or even having a fixed physical address Examples are post office boxes service addresses and poste restante general delivery Address format In most of the world addresses are written in order from most specific to general ie finest to coarsest information starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit For example In Englishspeaking countries the postal code usually comes last In much of Europe the code precedes the town name thus 1010 Lausanne Often the country code is still placed in front of the postal code CH1010 Lausanne However this is no longer demanded by postal authorities and has even been forbidden in certain countries If a house number is provided it is written on the same line as the street name a house name is written on the previous line When addresses are written inline line breaks are replaced by commas Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ either before or after the street name Similarly there are differences in the placement of postal codes in the UK they are written on a separate line at the end of the address in Australia Canada and the United States they usually appear immediately after the state or province on the same line in Austria Belgium France Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city on the same line East Asian addressing systems including Chinese Japanese and Korean addressing systems when written in their native scripts use the opposite ordering starting with the provinceprefecture ending with the addressee However both have the same order as western countries when written in the Latin alphabet The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units except the name of the addressee is put into the first line The Universal Postal Convention strongly recommends the following Mailing address format by country Argentina In Argentina an address must be mailed this way The postal code has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format which is shown in the example The new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning which allows it to be identified As the system has been changed recently the four digit format can still be used in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district Australia In common with the rest of the Englishspeaking world addresses in Australia put the street number—which may be a range—before the street name and the placename before the postcode Unlike addresses in most other comparable places the city is not included in the address but rather a much more finegrained locality is used usually referred to in Australia as a suburb or town – although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type the postcode serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address As an example there are around 8000 localities in Victoria cf List of localities in Victoria Australia and List of Melbourne suburbs yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes For certain large volume receivers or post offices the locality may be an institution or street name It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address unless this happens to be the name of the suburb and doing so may delay delivery Australia Post recommends that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters In Australia subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces apartments flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash instead As in the US the stateterritory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different statesterritories it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated In printed matter the postcode follows after two spaces in handwritten matter the postcode should be written in the boxes provided In addition to PO Boxes other delivery types which are typically abbreviated may include Australian Post Addressing Guidelines Austria In Austria the address is generally formatted as follows The

neighbourhoods a main building may have the same number as one or more subsidiary buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building They will be addressed as vul Lenina d 123 123 Lenin St An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building addressed as vul Lenina d 123 bud 2 123 Lenin St unit 2 where bud abbreviation for будынак budynak means a subsidiary building In newer areas with more regular street plans apartment buildings that dont face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number eg 123а 123б etc in Cyrillic alphabetical order In some microraion neighbourhoods with few if any buildings facing named streets the name or more likely number of the microraion planned housing development would be used instead of the street name thus someone may live at 4th microrayon d 123 kv 56 ie 123 4th Microraion apt 56 Source Belposhta Belgium The address starts with the most specific information addressee

the municipality the next four identifying a block or in large and scarcely populated areas a quadrant within the municipal territory The territories of most of the larger cities comprise several adjacent municipalities so it is important to mention it Smaller cities often consist of only one municipality with several unofficial neighbourhoods that are usually mentioned even for official addressing purposes Several large and mostly rural municipalities contain more than one small town in such cases the recipient address must mention either the town the postal code or both China The

house numbering As the first number is used the conscription or evidentional number which corresponds to the chronologic order of cadastral registration of the house as the second number past a slash is used the orientational number orientační číslo č or č o which expresses position on the street Sometimes only one of the two numbers is used or the numbers are used in inversed order and it can be difficult to distinguish which number is which Generally orientation numbers if exists are preferred for mail services Ex Josef Novák Brněnská 225616 123 07 Jitrnice How to correctly label the

by the postal operator Royal Mail is as follows The locality is required only where its absence would cause ambiguity for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets with the same name Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals Until 1996 a postal county or permitted abbreviation was required after the post town unless it was a special post town for example London The post town and postcode should each be on a separate line Historically each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre The postcode identifies from left to right increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system The first half of the postcode known as the outward code contains the postcode area and postcode district The second half known as the inward code contains the postcode sector and postcode unit Further information Postcodes in the United Kingdom United States Notes Traditionally only the United States Postal Service USPS has been permitted to deliver to a PO Box For
