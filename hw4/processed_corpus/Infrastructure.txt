 Infrastructure refers to the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country city or area including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function It typically characterises technical structures such as roads bridges tunnels water supply sewers electrical grids telecommunications and so forth and can be defined as the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable sustain or enhance societal living conditions History Main article History of infrastructure According to the Online Etymology Dictionary the word infrastructure has been used in English since 1887 and in French since 1875 originally meaning The installations that form the basis for any operation or system The word was imported from French where it means subgrade the native material underneath a constructed pavement or railway The word is a combination of the Latin prefix infra meaning below and structure The military use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of NATO in the 1940s and by 1970 was adopted by urban planners in its modern civilian sense The term came to prominence in the United States in the 1980s following the publication of America in Ruins which initiated a publicpolicy discussion of the nations infrastructure crisis purported to be caused by decades of inadequate investment and poor maintenance of public works This crisis discussion contributed to an increase in infrastructure asset management and maintenance planning in the US Publicpolicy discussions have been hampered by lack of a precise definition for infrastructure Definitions A 1987 US National Research Council panel adopted the term public works infrastructure referring to  both specific functional modes – highways streets roads and bridges mass transit airports and airways water supply and water resources wastewater management solidwaste treatment and disposal electric power generation and transmission telecommunications and hazardous waste management – and the combined system these modal elements comprise A comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities but also the operating procedures management practices and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses safe disposal of societys waste products provision of energy where it is needed and transmission of information within and between communities The OECD also classifies communications as a part of infrastructure The American Society of Civil Engineers has not defined the term though issuing a US Infrastructure Report Card every 24 years As of 2017 they grade 16 categories namely Aviation Bridges Dams Drinking Water Energy Hazardous Waste Inland Waterways Levees Parks Recreation Ports Rail Roads Schools Solid Waste Transit and Wastewater Hard infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industrial nation Soft infrastructure may refer to the institutions which are required to maintain an economy like health and cultural and social standards of a country such as the financial system the education system the health care system the system of government and law enforcement as well as emergency services The term critical infrastructure distinguishes those infrastructure elements that if significantly damaged or destroyed would cause serious disruption of a system or organization Storm flood or earthquake damage leading to loss of certain transportation routes in a city for example bridges crossing a river that would make it impossible for people to evacuate and for emergency services to operate would be deemed critical infrastructure Similarly an online booking system might be critical infrastructure for an airline These elements of infrastructure are the focus of recovery efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters Related concepts The term infrastructure may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts Land improvement and land development are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land and are owned and operated by the land owner For example an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements not infrastructure Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements not infrastructure The term public works includes governmentowned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings such as schools and court houses Public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver public services Public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by government Ownership and financing Main article Infrastructure and economics Infrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by private companies such as sole public utility or railway companies Generally most roads major ports and airports water distribution systems and sewage networks are publicly owned whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes tolls or metered user fees whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of longterm bonds Government owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the private sector or in publicprivate partnerships in addition to in the public sector As of 2008 in the United States for example public spending on infrastructure has varied between 23 and 36 of GDP since 1950 Many financial institutions invest in infrastructure In Keynesian economics the word infrastructure was exclusively used to describe public assets that facilitate production but not private assets of the same purpose In postKeynesian times the word has grown in popularity and has been applied with increasing generality to suggest the internal framework discernible in any technology system or business organisation Uses of the term Engineering and construction Engineers generally limit the term infrastructure to describe fixed assets that are in the form of a large network in other words hard infrastructure Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components Civil defense and economic development See also Civil defense by country Civil defense planners and developmental economists generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure including public services such as schools and hospitals emergency services such as police and fire fighting and basic financial services The notion of Infrastructurebased development combining longterm infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with public private partnerships has proven popular among Asian notably Singaporean and Chinese Mainland European and Latin American economists Military Military strategists use the term infrastructure to refer to all building and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces whether they are stationed in bases being deployed or engaged in operations For example barracks headquarters airfields communications facilities stores of military equipment port installations and maintenance stations Urban Urban or municipal infrastructure refers to hard infrastructure systems generally owned and operated by municipalities such as streets water distribution and sewers It may also include some of the facilities associated with soft infrastructure such as parks public pools schools hospitals and libraries Green infrastructure Green infrastructure is a concept that highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about land use planning In particular there is an emphasis on the life support functions provided by a network of natural ecosystems with an emphasis on interconnectivity to support longterm sustainability Examples include clean water and healthy soils as well as the more anthropocentric functions such as recreation and providing shade and shelter in and around towns and cities The concept can be extended to apply to the management of stormwater runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems or engineered systems that mimic natural systems to treat polluted runoff Marxism In Marxism the term infrastructure is sometimes used as a synonym for base in the dialectic synthetic pair base and superstructure However the Marxist notion of base is broader than the nonMarxist use of the term infrastructure and some soft infrastructure such as laws governance regulations and standards would be considered by Marxists to be part of the superstructure not the base Communications The term infrastructure may refer to informal and formal channels of communication political and social networks or beliefs held by members of particular groups as well as information technology software development tools Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves whether it is a city a nation a corporation or a collection of people with common interests Examples include IT infrastructure research infrastructure terrorist infrastructure employment infrastructure and tourism infrastructure In the developing world According to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals MDGs Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive especially in such as areas as landlocked rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africas improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005 and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant with on average thirty to forty percent returns for telecommunications ICT investments over forty percent for electricity generation and eighty percent for roads Regional differences The demand for infrastructure both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested There are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia The infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in AsiaPacific around US48 billion and what is needed US228 billion is around US180 billion every year In Latin America three percent of GDP around US71 billion would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand yet in 2005 for example only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately US24 billion In Africa in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of GDP or around US93 billion a year In fragile states over thirtyseven percent of GDP would be required Sources of funding The source of financing varies significantly across sectors Some sectors are dominated by government spending others by overseas development aid ODA and yet others by private investors In SubSaharan Africa governments spend around US94 billion out of a total of US249 billion In irrigation governments represent almost all spending In transport and energy a majority of investment is government spending In ICT and water supply and sanitation the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure Overall between them aid the private sector and nonOECD financiers exceed government spending The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments External financing increased in the 2000s decade and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US7 billion in 2002 to US27 billion in 2009 China in particular has emerged as an important investor See also Infrastructure portal Airport infrastructure Asset Management Plan Green infrastructure Infrastructure as a service Infrastructure asset
