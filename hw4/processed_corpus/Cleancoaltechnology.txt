 This article is about technological innovations related to coal pollution mitigation For the general concept of mitigation see Coal pollution mitigation Clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation When coal is used as a fuel source the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include sulphur dioxide SO2 nitrogen oxides NOx carbon dioxide CO2 mercury and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health contributing to acid rain lung cancer and cardiovascular disease As a result clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal gasification see also IGCC improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals brown coals to improve the calorific value and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal Historically the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx the most important gases in causation of acid rain and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter Technology Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept Precombustion capture This involves gasification of a feedstock such as coal to form synthesis gas which may be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2rich gas mixture from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated transported and ultimately sequestered This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations Postcombustion capture This refers to capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes Oxyfuel combustion Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen rather than in air which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient lowcost CO2 capture The Kemper County IGCC Project a 582 MW coal gasificationbased power plant will use precombustion capture of CO2 to capture 65 of the CO2 the plant produces which will be utilizedgeologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations The Saskatchewan Governments Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use postcombustion aminebased scrubber technology to capture 90 of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields An early example of a coalbased plant using oxyfuel carboncapture technology is Swedish company Vattenfallâ€™s Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg Germany built by German firm Siemens which went online in September 2008 The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants separates them and compresses the CO2 into a liquid Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical Other examples of oxycombustion carbon capture are in progress Callide Power Station has retrofitted a 30MWth existing PCfired power plant to operate in oxyfuel mode in Ciuden Spain Endesa has a newly built 30MWth oxyfuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion CFBC technology BabcockThermoEnergys Zero Emission Boiler System ZEBS is oxycombustionbased this system features near 100 carboncapture and according to company information virtually no airemissions Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater lowrank coals Lowrank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent The UK governments is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country In August 2010 UKbased company B9 Coal announced a clean coal project with 90 carbon capture to be put forward to DECC This would help the UK raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world This proposed project gasifies coal underground and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide The hydrogen is then used as an emissionsfree fuel to run an alkaline fuel cell whilst the carbon dioxide is captured This UK project could provide a worldleading template for clean coal with CCS globally Demonstration projects in the United States In the late 1980s and early 1990s the US Department of Energy DOE began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use The program called the Clean Coal Technology Clean Coal Power Initiative CCPI has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coalbased electricity generation The National Energy Technology Laboratory has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round Round 1 CCPI Projects Advanced MultiProduct Coal Utilization ByProduct Processing Plant Demonstration of Integrated Optimization Software at the Baldwin Energy Complex Gilberton CoaltoClean Fuels and Power CoProduction Project Increasing Power Plant Efficiency Lignite Fuel Enhancement TOXECON Retrofit for Mercury and MultiPollutant Control on Three 90MW CoalFired Boilers Western Greenbrier CoProduction Demonstration Project Commercial Demonstration of the Airborne Process Integration of Advanced Emission Controls to Produce NextGeneration Circulating Fluid Bed Coal Generating Unit Round 2 CCPI Projects Airborne Process Commercial Scale Demonstration Program Demonstration of a CoalBased Transport Gasifier Mercury Species and MultiPollutant Control Project Mesaba Energy Project Round 3 CCPI Projects American Electric Power Project Antelope Valley Station PostCombustion CO2 Project Hydrogen Energy California Project NRG Energy Project Southern Company Carbon Capture Kemper Project Summit Texas Clean Energy Project These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of costeffective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coalfired power plants This portfolio has positioned the US as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx NOx and mercury and more recently for carbon capture consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coalbased power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands leading to widespread global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program a CCS research and development program According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the US Department of Energy clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers costeffective clean coalbased energy Clean coal and the environment Further information Environmental effects of coal According to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the burning of coal a fossil fuel is a major contributor to global warming See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report As 255 of the worlds electrical generation in 2004 was from coalfired generation see World energy resources and consumption reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol will require modifications to how coal is utilized Coal which is primarily used for the generation of electricity is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the USA The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than 50 billion towards the development and deployment of traditional clean coal technologies over the past 30 years and promising 500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development Some in the coal industryC2ESand the US Department of Energy refer to carbon capture and sequestration CCUS as the latest in clean coal technologies CCS is a means to capture carbon dioxide from any source compress it to a dense liquidlike state and inject and permanently store it underground Currently there are more than 80 carbon capture and sequestration projects underway in the United States All components of CCS technology have been used for decades in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications commercialscale CCS is currently being tested in the US and other countries Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards which could include leakage of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere induced geological instability or contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies Supporters of clean coal use the Great Plains Synfuels plant to support the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery Supporters admit that carbon sequestration is expensive See also Biochar Carbon capture and storage Carbon sequestration Coal phase out Coalwater slurry fuel Energy development Fluidized bed combustion Futuregen Greenwash James E
