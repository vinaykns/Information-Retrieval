 Walney Wind Farm is an offshore wind farm 14 km west of Walney Island off the coast of Cumbria in the Irish Sea England It has a capacity of 367 MW which makes it one of the worlds largest offshore wind farms The wind farm was developed by Walney UK Offshore Windfarms Limited a partnership between DONG Energy and Scottish and Southern Energy The farm is immediately north west of the West of Duddon Sands Wind Farm and also to the west of Ormonde Wind Farm The farm is in water depths ranging from 19m to 23m and covers an area of approximately 73 km Description Both phases have 51 turbines giving a nameplate capacity of 367 MW Until September 2012 it was the worlds largest operational offshore wind farm It is expected to generate about 1300 GW·hyear of electricity with a load factor of 43 Construction In 2004 DONG Energy was awarded a 50year lease from The Crown Estate to develop a wind farm off Walney Island as part of the second UK offshore wind farm tendering process known as Round 2 The farm was constructed sequentially in two phases with overlapping installation activities to reduce the overall construction timeframe The project involved constructing the wind turbines and their foundations building two offshore substations and installing two undersea power cables one for each phase and two short onshore cables to connect to two existing onshore Electrical substations for connection into the UK National Grid A cable was laid by Stemat Spirit Phase 1 connects to a substation at Heysham and Phase 2 connects to substation at Stanah south of Fleetwood Both undersea cables pass close by Barrow Wind Farm All the construction work was expected to take less than 2 years with both phases operational by the end of 2011 On 11 July 2011 Phase 1 became operational comprising 51 turbines with an installed capacity of 1836MW Walney 2 began sending power to the grid on 1 November 2011 In February 2012 DONG Energy claimed to have installed the 51 turbines in Walney 2 in 5 months and 14 days including monopiles and complete turbines about 325 days per turbine Walney 1 took 7 months The improvement is due to commonality of projects and resources The wind farm was officially opened on 9 February 2012 by the new energy secretary Ed Davey MP although the last of the 51 turbines in Walney 2 were only activated in April 2012 Walney Extension In November 2014 DONG Energy was given development consent for an extension to the Walney offshore wind farm The development consent allowed a maximum of 207 turbines to be added to the existing 102 turbines The maximum generating capacity of the extension was said to be 750MW although DONG was reported to be proceeding with a project based around 660MW Construction is expected to begin in 2017 In 2015 DONG chose the 8MW Vestas V164 for Phase 1 and the 7MW Siemens gearless turbine for Phase 2 Involvement in oil spill In 2014 a dive vessel owned by Danish firm Offshore Marine Services was carrying out routine inspection work when an anchor cable broke and the ship slammed into one of 102 turbines installed at the Walney Offshore Wind Farm The UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency surveyed the crash site and reported that a surface sheen stretching 33 feet wide and 07 nautical miles long was trailing the vessel The agency said that unlike heavier crude oil the marine engine oil should evaporate or disperse naturally References External links LORC Knowledge Datasheet for Walney 1 Offshore Wind farm LORC Knowledge Datasheet for Walney 2 Offshore Wind farm
