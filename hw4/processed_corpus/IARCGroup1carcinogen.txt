 Substances mixtures and exposure circumstances in this list have been classified by the IARC as Group 1 The agent mixture is carcinogenic to humans The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are carcinogenic to humans This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans Exceptionally an agent mixture may be placed in this category when evidence of carcinogenicity in humans is less than sufficient but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and strong evidence in exposed humans that the agent mixture acts through a relevant mechanism of carcinogenicity Agents Substances 2Naphthylamine Acetaldehyde associated with consumption of alcoholic beverages 4Aminobiphenyl Aflatoxins Aristolochic acids and plants containing them Arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds Asbestos Azathioprine Benzene Benzidine and dyes metabolized to Benzoapyrene Beryllium and beryllium compounds Chlornapazine

group Evaluated as a group There is also conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium Ethanol is not carcinogenic but is metabolised to acetaldehyde which is carcinogenic Specific radionuclides for which there is sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity to humans are also listed individually as Group 1 agents There is also conclusive evidence that this agent tamoxifen reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer References External links Description of the list of classifications IARC List of classifications latest version List
