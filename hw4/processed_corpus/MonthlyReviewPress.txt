farm in New Hampshire where one of them was living The two men were literary scholar and Christian socialist FO Matty Matthiessen and Marxist economist Paul Sweezy who were former colleagues at Harvard University Matthiessen came into an inheritance after his father died in an automobile accident in California and had no pressing need for the money Matthiessen made the offer to Sweezy to underwrite that magazine Sweezy and Leo Huberman were always talking about committing the sum of 5000 per year for three years Matthiessens funds made the launch of Monthly Review possible although the amount of the seed money was reduced to 4000 per year in the second and third years by the executors of Matthiessens estate following his suicide in 1950 Although Matthiessen was the financial angel of the new publication from the outset the editorial task was handled by Sweezy and his cothinker the left wing popular writer Leo Huberman The author of an array of books and pamphlets during the 1930s and early 1940s the New York Universityeducated Huberman worked fulltime on Monthly Review from its establishment until his death of a heart attack in 1968 Sweezy and Huberman were complementary figures guiding the publication with Sweezys theoretical bent and writing ability put to use for a majority of the editorial content while Huberman took charge of the business and administrative aspects of the enterprise Sweezy remained at home in New Hampshire traveling down to the New York City once a month to read manuscripts where Huberman conducted the daytoday operations of the magazine along with his wife Gerty Huberman and family friend Sybil Huntington May Briefly joining Sweezy and Huberman as a third founding editor of Monthly Review — although not listed as such on the publications masthead — was German émigré Otto Nathan 18931987 Although his time of editorial association with MR was short Nathan was instrumental in obtaining what would become a seminal essay for the magazine a lead piece for the debut May 1949 issue by physicist Albert Einstein entitled Why Socialism Another key contributor during the first 15 years of MR was economist Paul Baran frequently considered as the third member of an editorial troika including Sweezy and Huberman A tenured professor at Stanford University Baran was one of a very few selfidentified Marxists to teach economics at American universities during the Cold War period Baran worked closely with Sweezy on a book regarded as a landmark in Marxist theory entitled Monopoly Capital although he died of a heart attack prior to the works first publication in 1966 Monthly Review launched in 1949 with a circulation of just 450 copies most of whom were personal acquaintances of either Huberman or Sweezy The magazines ideology and readership closely paralleled that of the independent Marxist weekly newspaper The National Guardian established in 1948 Despite a conservative political climate in the United States the magazine quickly reached a critical mass of subscribers with its paid circulation rising to 2500 in 1950 and to 6000 in 1954 McCarthy period During the McCarthyism of the early 1950s editors Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman were targeted for subversive activities Sweezys case tried by New Hampshire Attorney General went all the way to the Supreme Court and became a seminal case on freedom of speech when the Court ruled in his favor In 1953 the magazine added veteran radical Scott Nearing to the magazines ranks From that date and for nearly 20 years Nearing authored a monthly column descriptively entitled World Events During the Truman and Eisenhower years a number of left wing intellectuals found a space for their work in MR including a number that would gain in stature in the ensuing liberalized decade such as pacifist activist Staughton Lynd 1952 historian William Appleman Williams 1952 and sociologist C Wright Mills 1958 New Left era and after From the middle years of the 1960s radical political theory saw a resurgence in association with the emergence of a New Left in Europe and North America Monthly Review grew in stature in tandem with this resurgence While remaining an intellectual journal not oriented towards acquiring a mass readership circulation of the publication nonetheless grew throughout this era approaching 9100 in 1970 before peaking at 11500 in 1977 While MR remained essentially a publication with roots in the socalled Old Left it was not unfriendly to the young radical movement which grew in conjunction with the Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to conscription and the Vietnam War Among those associated with the 1960s New Left published by the Monthly Review were C Wright Mills Herbert Marcuse Todd Gitlin Carl Oglesby David Horowitz and Noam Chomsky The Monthly Review editorial staff was joined in May 1969 by radical economist Harry Magdoff replacing Leo Huberman who had died in 1968 Magdoff a reader of the publication from its first issue in 1949 bolstered the already welldeveloped ThirdWorldist orientation of the publication based upon revolutionary events in Cuba China and Vietnam Certain Maoist influence made itself felt in the content of the publication in this period Monthly Review became steadily more critical of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s with editor Paul Sweezy objecting to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the suppression of the Polish trade union Solidarity through martial law in 1981 In the latter case Sweezy declared the incident had proved beyond doubt that the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc have become the expression and the guardians of a new rigidified hierarchical structure which has nothing in common with the kind of socialist society Marxists have always regarded as the goal of modern working class movements Despite an apparent decline of the American Left in the 1980s MRs circulation hovered in the 8000 range throughout the decade Publication today Since 2006 John Bellamy Foster has been the sole editor together with Michael D Yates as associate editor two assistant editors and an editorial committee Political orientation From its first issue Monthly Review attacked the premise that capitalism was capable of infinite growth through Keynesian macroeconomic finetuning Instead the magazines editors and leading writers have remained true to the traditional Marxist perspective that capitalist economies contain internal contradictions which will ultimately lead to their collapse and reconstitution on a new socialist basis Topics of editorial concern have included poverty unequal distribution of incomes and wealth racism imperialism in relations between economically developed and less developed nations and inefficiencies in production and distribution seen as endemic to the capitalist system Although not averse to discussion of esoteric matters of socialist theory MR was generally characterized by an aversion to doctrinaire citations of Marxist canon in favor of the analysis of realworld economic and historical trends Readability was emphasized and the use of academic jargon discouraged Editors Huberman and Sweezy argued as early as 1952 that massive and expanding military spending was an integral part of the process of capitalist stabilization driving corporate profits bolstering levels of employment and absorbing surplus production The illusion of an external military threat was required to sustain this system of priorities in government spending they argued consequently effort was made by the editors to challenge the dominant Cold War paradigm of Democracy versus Communism in the material published in the magazine In its editorial line Monthly Review offered critical support of the Soviet Union during its early years although over time the magazine became increasingly critical of Soviet dedication to Socialism in One Country and peaceful coexistence seeing that country as playing a more or less conservative role in a world marked by national revolutionary movements After the SinoSoviet split of the 1960s Sweezy and Huberman soon came to see the Peoples Republic of China as the actual center of the world revolutionary movement Monthly Review remained true to an independent orientation throughout its history and never aligned with any specific revolutionary movement or political organization Many of its articles have been written by academics journalists and freelance public intellectuals including Tariq Ali Isabel Allende Samir Amin Julian Bond Marilyn Buck G D H Cole Bernardine Dohrn W E B Du Bois Barbara Ehrenreich Andre Gunder Frank Eduardo Galeano Che Guevara Lorraine Hansberry Edward Herman Eric Hobsbawm Michael Klare Saul Landau Michael Parenti Robert W McChesney Ralph Miliband Marge Piercy Frances Fox Piven Adrienne Rich JeanPaul Sartre Daniel Singer E P Thompson Immanuel Wallerstein and Raymond Williams In 2004 Monthly Review

Press Monthly Review Press an allied endeavor was launched in 1951 in response to the inability of the maverick leftwing journalist I F Stone to otherwise find a publisher for his book The Hidden
