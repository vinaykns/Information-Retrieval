western Pacific Ocean coast of the US California is bordered by the other US states of Oregon Nevada and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California The state capital is Sacramento Los Angeles is Californias most populous city and the countrys second largest after New York City The state also has the nations most populous county Los Angeles County and its largest county by area San Bernardino County Californias diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east and from the redwood–Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast The Central Valley a major agricultural area dominates the states center Though California is wellknown for its warm Mediterranean climate the large size of the state means it can vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior as well as snowy alpine in the mountains What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War The western portion of Alta California then was organized as the State of California and admitted as the 31st state on September 9 1850 The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes with largescale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom If it were a country California would be the 6th largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous It is also regarded as a global trendsetter in both popular culture and politics and is the origin of the film industry the hippie counterculture the Internet and the personal computer among others Fiftyeight percent of the states economy is centered on finance government real estate services technology and professional scientific and technical business services The San Francisco Bay Area has the nations highest median household income by metropolitan area and is the headquarters of three of the worlds largest 20 firms by revenue Chevron Apple and McKesson Although it accounts for only 15 percent of the states economy Californias agriculture industry has the highest output of any US state Etymology Main article Etymology of California The word California originally referred to the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current United States states of California Nevada and Utah and parts of Arizona New Mexico Texas and Wyoming The name California is surmised by some writers to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia who fought alongside Muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader the Caliph fictionally implying that California was the Caliphate The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandián written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo The kingdom of Queen Calafia according to Montalvo was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts and rich in gold Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them and they lived in the manner of Amazons They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks — Chapter CLVII of The Adventures of Esplandián When Spanish explorer Francisco de Ulloa was exploring the western coast of North America his initial surveys of the Baja California Peninsula led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent so he dubbed the island after the mythical island in Montalvos writing This conventional wisdom that California was an island with maps drawn to reflect this belief lasted as late as the 1700s Shortened forms of the states name include CA Cal Calif and USCA History Main article History of California Precontact Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10000 years California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in preColumbian North America Various estimates of the native population range from 100000 to 300000 The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resourcerich coasts large chiefdoms such as the Chumash Pomo and Salinan Trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups 16th 17th and 18th centuries The first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was a Spanish sailing expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542 Some 37 years later English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579 Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565 The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587 when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain Despite the ontheground explorations of California in the 16th century Rodríguezs idea of California as an island persisted That depiction appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century After the Portolà expedition of 1769–70 Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 California Missions on or near the coast of Alta Upper California beginning in San Diego During the same period Spanish military forces built several forts presidios and three small towns pueblos Two of the pueblos grew into the cities of Los Angeles and San Jose The Spanish colonization brought the genocide of the indigenous Californian peoples 19th century Imperial Russia explored the California coast and established a trading post at Fort Ross Its early 19thcentury coastal settlements north of San Francisco Bay constituted the southernmost Russian colony in North America and were spread over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay In 1821 the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico including California independence from Spain for the next 25 years Alta California remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico Cattle ranches or ranchos emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California After Mexican independence from Spain the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were secularized by 1834 The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios Spanishspeaking Californians who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants From the 1820s trappers and settlers from the United States and the future Canada arrived in Northern California These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail California Trail Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California Between 1831 and 1836 California experienced a series of revolts against Mexico this culminated in the 1836 California revolt led by Juan Bautista Alvarado which ended after Mexico appointed him governor of the department The revolt which had momentarily declared California an independent state was successful with the assistance of American and British residents of California including Isaac Graham after 1840 100 of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the Graham affair in 1840 One of the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts he determined that California should become part of the United States Marsh conducted a letterwriting campaign espousing the California climate soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as Marshs route His letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to California He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled and assisted in their obtaining passports After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California Marsh helped end the rule of the last Mexican governor of California thereby paving the way to Californias ultimate acquisition by the United States In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt Afterwards rebels raised the Bear Flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words California Republic at Sonoma The Republics only president was William B Ide who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt The California Republic was short lived the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican–American War 1846–48 When Commodore John D Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the United States forces After a series of defensive battles in Southern California the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13 1847 securing American control in California Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war the western territory of Alta California became the United States state of California and Arizona Nevada Colorado and Utah became United States Territories The lightly populated lower region of California the Baja Peninsula remained in the possession of Mexico In 1846 the nonnative population of California was estimated to be no more than 8000 plus about 100000 Native Americans down from about 300000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769 After gold was discovered in 1848 the population burgeoned with United States citizens Europeans Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush By 1854 over 300000 settlers had come Between 1847 and 1870 the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150000 On September 9 1850 as part of the Compromise of 1850 California was admitted to the United States undivided as a free state denying the expansion of slavery to the Pacific Coast Californias native population precipitously declined above all from Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity As in other states the native inhabitants were forcibly removed from their lands by incoming miners ranchers and farmers And although California entered the union as a free state the loitering or orphaned Indians were de facto enslaved by Mexican and AngloAmerican masters under the 1853 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians There were massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed Between 1850 and 1860 California paid around 15 million dollars some 250000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations In later decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them As a result the rise of California was a calamity for the native inhabitants Several scholars and Native American activists including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo have described the actions of the California government as a genocide The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule was located at Monterey from 1777 until 1845 Pio Pico last Mexican governor of Alta California moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845 The United States consulate was also located in Monterey under consul Thomas O Larkin In 1849 the Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey Among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital The first legislative sessions were held in San Jose 1850–1851 Subsequent locations included Vallejo 1852–1853 and nearby Benicia 1853–1854 these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854 with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento Initially travel between California and the rest of the continental United States was time consuming and dangerous A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains Once completed hundreds of thousands of United States citizens came west where new Californians were discovering that land in the state if irrigated during the dry summer months was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general Vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown including oranges in Southern California and the foundation was laid for the states prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere 20th century Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66 In the period from 1900 to 1965 the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union In 1940 the Census Bureau reported Californias population as 60 Hispanic 24 Asian and 895 nonHispanic white To meet the populations needs major engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts the Oroville and Shasta Dams and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built across the state The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education Meanwhile attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate cheap land and the states wide variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s California manufactured 87 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II ranking third behind New York and Michigan among the 48 states After World War II Californias economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state and develop a hightech region in the area now known as Silicon Valley As a result of these efforts California is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the United States center of agricultural production Just before the Dot Com Bust California had the 5th largest economy in the world among nations Yet since 1991 and starting in the late 1980s in Southern California California has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years This is often referred to by the media as the California exodus However during the 20th century two great disasters happened in California The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in US history Geography Main article Geography of California California is the 3rd largest state in the United States in area after Alaska and Texas California is often geographically bisected into two regions Southern California comprising the 10 southernmost counties and Northern California comprising the 48 northernmost counties In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the south The Central Valley is Californias productive agricultural heartland Divided in two by the SacramentoSan Joaquin River Delta the northern portion the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River while the southern portion the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them With dredging the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports The SacramentoSan Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost twothirds of the states population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley The Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast The Sierra Nevada Spanish for snowy range includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states Mount Whitney at 14505 feet 4421 m The range embraces Yosemite Valley famous for its glacially carved domes and Sequoia National Park home to the giant sequoia trees the largest living organisms on Earth and the deep freshwater lake Lake Tahoe the largest lake in the state by volume To the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake an essential migratory bird habitat In the western part of the state is Clear Lake the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California Though Lake Tahoe is larger it is divided by the CaliforniaNevada border The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers including Palisade Glacier the southernmost glacier in the United States About 45 percent of the states total surface area is covered by forests and Californias diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world an individual bristlecone pine is over 5000 years old In the south is a large inland salt lake the Salton Sea The southcentral desert is called the Mojave to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America the Badwater Basin at −279 feet −85 m The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles 140 km Indeed almost all of southeastern California is arid hot desert with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water California contains both the highest point Mount Whitney and the lowest point Death Valley in the contiguous United States A majority of Californias cities are located in either the San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California or the Los Angeles area the RiversideSan BernardinoInland Empire or the San Diego metropolitan area in Southern California The Los Angeles Area the Bay Area and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast As part of the Ring of Fire California is subject to tsunamis floods droughts Santa Ana winds wildfires landslides on steep terrain and has several volcanoes It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state in particular the San Andreas Fault About 37000 earthquakes are recorded each year but most are too small to be felt Climate Main article Climate of California Although most of the state has a Mediterranean climate due to the states large size the climate ranges from subarctic to subtropical The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast Farther inland there are colder winters and hotter summers The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States Just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south Californias mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are westfacing mountain slopes Northwestern California has a temperate climate and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast The high mountains including the Sierra Nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer Californias mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts The higher elevation deserts of eastern California have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters Death Valley a desert with large expanses below sea level is considered the hottest location in the world the highest temperature in the world 134 °F 567 °C was recorded there on July 10 1913 The lowest temperature in California was −45 °F −43 °C in 1937 in Boca The table below lists average temperatures for August and December in a selection of places throughout the state some highly populated and some not This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt Bay region around Eureka the extreme heat of Death Valley and the mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevadas Ecology Main article Ecology of California See also Environment of California California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities California is part of the Nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions Californias large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere such as the Catalina ironwood Lyonothamnus floribundus Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac Ceanothus Many California endemics have become endangered as urbanization logging overgrazing and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat Flora and fauna Main articles Fauna of California and California Floristic Province See also List of California native plants California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora the largest trees the tallest trees and the oldest trees Californias native grasses are perennial plants After European contact these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses and in modern times Californias hills turn a characteristic goldenbrown in summer Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran desert upper Sonoran foothill regions and some coastal lands transition coastal areas and moist northeastern counties and the Canadian Hudsonian and Arctic Zones comprising the states highest elevations Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus mesquite and paloverde The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt characterized by forests of small shrubs stunted trees and herbaceous plants Nemophila mint Phacelia Viola and the California poppy Eschscholzia californica – the state flower – also flourish in this zone along with the lupine more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world The transition zone includes most of Californias forests with the redwood Sequoia sempervirens and the big tree or giant sequoia Sequoiadendron giganteum among the oldest living things on earth some are said to have lived at least 4000 years Tanbark oak California laurel sugar pine madrona broadleaved maple and Douglasfir also grow here Forest floors are covered with swordfern alumnroot barrenwort and trillium and there are thickets of huckleberry azalea elder and wild currant Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa tulip and tiger and leopard lilies The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine red fir and lodgepole pine to thrive Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus the unique Sierra puffball is also found here Right below the timberline in the Hudsonian zone the whitebark foxtail and silver pines grow At about 10500 feet 3200 m begins the Arctic zone a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers including Sierra primrose yellow columbine alpine buttercup and alpine shooting star Common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus acacia pepper tree geranium and Scotch broom The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower Antioch Dunes evening primrose Solano grass San Clemente Island larkspur salt marsh birds beak McDonalds rockcress and Santa Barbara Island liveforever As of December 1997 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone the mammals include the jackrabbit kangaroo rat squirrel and opossum Common birds include the owl roadrunner cactus wren and various species of hawk The areas reptilian life include the sidewinder viper desert tortoise and horned toad The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope brownfooted woodrat and ringtailed cat Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher bushtit and California condor In the transition zone there are Colombian blacktailed deer black bears gray foxes cougars bobcats and Roosevelt elk Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone In addition amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too Birds such as the kingfisher chickadee towhee and hummingbird thrive here as well The Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel snowshoe hare and several species of chipmunks Conspicuous birds include the bluefronted jay Sierra chickadee Sierra hermit thrush water ouzel and Townsends solitaire As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone birds become scarcer While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region other bird species such as the hummingbird and Clarks nutcracker Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney whitetailed jackrabbit and the bighorn sheep As of April 2003 the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer coyote mountain lion northern flicker and several species of hawk and sparrow Aquatic life in California thrives from the states mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline Numerous trout species are found among them rainbow golden and cutthroat Migratory species of salmon are common as well Deepsea life forms include sea bass yellowfin tuna barracuda and several types of whale Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals sea lions and many types of shorebirds including migratory species As of April 2003 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox Point Arena mountain beaver Pacific pocket mouse salt marsh harvest mouse Morro Bay kangaroo rat and five other species of kangaroo rat Amargosa vole California least tern California condor loggerhead shrike San Clemente sage sparrow San Francisco garter snake five species of salamander three species of chub and two species of pupfish Eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher Paiute cutthroat trout southern sea otter and northern spotted owl California has a total of 290821 acres 117691 km of National Wildlife Refuges As of September 2010 123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list provided by the US Fish Wildlife Service Also as of the same year 178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list Rivers Main article List of rivers of California The vast majority of rivers in California are dammed as part of two massive water projects the Central Valley Project providing water to the agricultural central valley the California State Water Project diverting water from northern to southern California The states coasts rivers and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission The two most prominent rivers within California are the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin including the Pit River the Tuolumne River and the Feather River The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast north and south of San Francisco Bay respectively and the Eel River is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural undammed state The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California Some other important rivers are the Klamath River and the Trinity River in the far north coast and the Colorado River on the southeast border with Arizona Regions Further information List of regions of California and List of places in California Demographics Main article Demographics of California Population The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of California was 39144818 on July 1 2015 a 508 increase since the 2010 United States Census Between 2000 and 2009 there was a natural increase of 3090016 5058440 births minus 2179958 deaths During this time period international migration produced a net increase of 1816633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1509708 resulting in a net inmigration of 306925 people The state of Californias own statistics show a population of 38292687 for January 1 2009 However according to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research since 1990 almost 34 million Californians have moved to other states with most leaving to Texas Nevada and Arizona California is the 2ndmost populous subnational entity in the Western Hemisphere and the Americas with a population second to that of the state of São Paulo in Brazil Californias population is greater than that of all but 34 countries of the world The Greater Los Angeles Area is the 2ndlargest metropolitan area in the United States after the New York metropolitan area while Los Angeles with nearly half the population of New York is the 2ndlargest city in the United States Also Los Angeles County has held the title of most populous United States county for decades and it alone is more populous than 42 United States states Including Los Angeles four of the top 15 most populous cities in the US are in California Los Angeles 2nd San Diego 8th San Jose 10th and San Francisco 13th The center of

second incorporated city each receiving incorporation on March 27 1850 Jurupa Valley became the states most recent and 482nd incorporated municipality on July 1 2011 The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area the San Francisco Bay Area the RiversideSan Bernardino Area the San Diego metropolitan area and the Sacramento metropolitan area Migration Starting in the year 2010 for the first time since the California Gold Rush Californiaborn residents make up the majority of the states population Along with the rest of the United States Californias immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000searly 2010s Immigration from Latin American countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from Asia In total for 2011 there were 277304 immigrants 57 came from Asian countries vs 22 from Latin American countries Net immigration from Mexico previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants has dropped to zeroless than zero since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating As a result it is estimated that Hispanic citizens will constitute 49 of the population by 2060 instead of the previously projected 2050 due primarily to domestic births The states population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lowerskilled workers The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest plunged from a high of 11 million in 2005 to just 367000 in 2011 Despite these recent trends illegal aliens constituted an estimated 73 percent of the states population the third highest percentage of any state in the country totaling nearly 26 million In particular illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in Los Angeles Monterey San Benito Imperial and Napa Counties – the latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor More than half of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico LGBT Main articles LGBT rights in California and LGBT history in California California is considered generally liberal in its policies regarding the LGBT community and the rights of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people have received greater recognition since 1960 at both the state and municipal level California is home to a number of gay villages such as the Castro District in San Francisco Hillcrest in San Diego and West Hollywood Through the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999 California became the first state in the United States to recognize samesex relationships in any legal capacity In 2000 voters passed Proposition 22 which restricted state recognition of marriage to oppositesex couples This was struck down by the California Supreme Court in May 2008 effectively legalizing samesex marriage however this was overruled later that same year when California voters passed Proposition 8 After further judicial cases in 2013 the US Supreme Court rendered the law void allowing samesex marriages in California to resume National origins According to the United States Census Bureau in 2015 the population selfidentifies as alone or in combination 729 White 147 Asian 65 Black or African American 38 Two or More Races 17 Native American and Alaska Native 05 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander By ethnicity in 2015 the population was 612 nonHispanic of any race and 388 Hispanic or Latino of any race As of 2011 751 of Californias population younger than age 1 were minorities meaning that they had at least one parent who was not nonHispanic white white Hispanics are counted as minorities In terms of total numbers California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States an estimated 22200000 residents The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States an estimated 2250000 residents Californias Asian American population is estimated at 44 million constituting a third of the nations total Californias Native American population of 285000 is the most of any state According to estimates from 2011 California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers making up 60 of the state population Over the past 25 years the population of nonHispanic whites has declined while Hispanic and Asian populations have grown Between 1970 and 2011 nonHispanic whites declined from 80 of the States population to 40 while Hispanics grew from 32 in 2000 to 38 in 2011 It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49 of the population by 2060 primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration With the decline of immigration from Latin America Asian Americans now constitute the fastest growing racialethnic group in California this growth primarily driven by immigration from China India and the Philippines respectively Languages English serves as Californias de jure and de facto official language In 2010 the Modern Language Association of America estimated that 5702 19429309 of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home while 4298 spoke another primary language at home According to the 2007 American Community Survey 73 of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English well or very well with 98 not speaking English at all Like most US states 32 out of 50 California law enshrines English as its official language and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters Various government agencies do and are often required to furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences In total 16 languages other than English were spoken as primary languages at home by more than 100000 persons more than any other state in the nation New York State in second place had 9 languages other than English spoken by more than 100000 persons The most common language spoken besides English was Spanish spoken by 2846 9696638 of the population With Asia contributing most of Californias new immigrants California had the highest concentration nationwide of Vietnamese and Chinese speakers the second highest concentration of Korean and the third highest concentration of Tagalog speakers California has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages of Mexico that are spoken among California farmworkers All of Californias indigenous languages are endangered although there are now efforts toward language revitalization As a

Infrastructure Energy Main article Energy use in California Because it is the most populous United States state California is one of the countrys largest users of energy However because of its high energy rates conservation mandates mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any United States state Due to the high electricity demand California imports more electricity than any other state primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest via Path 15 and Path 66 and coal and natural gasfired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46 As a result of the states strong environmental movement California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020 Currently several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert Californias wind farms include Altamont Pass San Gorgonio Pass and Tehachapi Pass Several dams across the state provide hydroelectric power It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100 renewable energy including heating cooling and mobility by 2050 The states crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast including the large MidwaySunset Oil Field Natural gasfired power plants typically account for more than onehalf of state electricity generation California is also home to two major nuclear power plants Diablo Canyon and San Onofre the latter having been shut down in 2013 Also voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal In addition several cities such as Oakland Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as nuclearfree zones Transportation Main article Transportation in California Californias vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlledaccess highways freeways limitedaccess roads expressways and highways California is known for its car culture giving Californias cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation nicknamed Caltrans The

article Water in California Californias interconnected water system is the worlds largest managing over 40000000 acre feet 49 km of water per year centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors especially in the arid southern portion of the state The states widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists The California Water Wars a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights is one of the most wellknown examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said Weve been in crisis for quite some time because were now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s So it developed into a battle between

Incorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or generallaw municipalities Generallaw municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities All ten of the states most populous cities are charter cities Most small cities have a councilmanager form of government where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city Some larger cities have a directlyelected mayor who oversees the city government In many councilmanager cities the city council selects one of its members as a mayor sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial The Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated citycounty in California where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction The San Francisco Board of Supervisors also acts as the city council and the Mayor of San Francisco also serves as the county administrative officer School districts and special

idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter In sociocultural mores and national politics Californians are perceived as more liberal than other Americans especially those who live in the inland states Among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting California was the second state to recall their state governor the second state to legalize abortion and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by voters including Proposition 8 in 2008 Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the states primary election process California has also experienced disputes over water rights and a tax revolt culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 limiting state property taxes The states trend towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party can be seen in state elections From 1899 to 1939 California had Republican governors Since 1990 California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal state and local offices including current Governor Jerry Brown however the state has elected Republican Governors

both houses of the state legislature There are 56 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the Assembly and 26 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the Senate The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections Republicans have not won Californias electoral votes since 1988 In the United States House the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the CA delegation of the 110th United States
