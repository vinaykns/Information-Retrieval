 Seawater or salt water is water from a sea or ocean On average seawater in the worlds oceans has a salinity of about 35 35 gL or 0600 M This means that every kilogram roughly one litre by volume of seawater has approximately 35 grams 12 oz of dissolved salts predominantly sodium Na and chloride Cl− ions Average density at the surface is 1025 kgl Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water density 10 kgl at 4 °C 39 °F because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases At typical salinity it freezes at about −2 °C 28 °F The coldest seawater ever recorded in a liquid state was in 2010 in a stream under an Antarctic glacier and measured −26 °C 273 °F Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 75 and 84 However there is no universally accepted reference pHscale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 014 units Geochemistry Salinity Further information Salinity § Seawater Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 31 gkg and 38 gkg seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths near melting glaciers or vast amounts precipitation eg Monsoon seawater can be substantially less saline The most saline open sea is the Red Sea where high rates of evaporation low precipitation and low river runoff and confined circulation result in unusually salty water The salinity in isolated bodies of water for example the Dead Sea can be considerably greater still Historically several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater A popular scale was the Practical Salinity Scale where salinity was measured in practical salinity units psu The current standard for salinity is the Reference Salinity scale with the salinity expressed in units of gkg Thermophysical properties of Seawater The density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kgm depending on the temperature and salinity At a temperature of 25 °C salinity of 35 gkg and 1 atm pressure the density of seawater is 10236  kgm Deep in the ocean under high pressure seawater can reach a density of 1050 kgm or higher The density of seawater also changes with salinity Brines generated by seawater desalination plants can have salinities up to 120 gkg The density of typical seawater brine of 120 gkg salinity at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure is 1088 kgm Seawater pH is limited to the range 75 to 84 The speed of sound in seawater is about 1500 ms whereas speed of sound is usually around 330 ms in air at roughly 1000hPa pressure 1 atmosphere and varies with water temperature salinity and pressure The thermal conductivity of seawater is 06 WmK at 25 °C and a salinity of 35 gkg The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature Compositional differences from freshwater Seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater However the ratios of solutes differ dramatically For instance although seawater contains about 28 times more bicarbonate than river water based on molarity the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water Bicarbonate ions also constitute 48 of river water solutes but only 014 of all seawater ions Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes sodium and chlorine have very long residence times while calcium vital for carbonate formation tends to precipitate much more quickly The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium chloride magnesium sulfate and calcium Its osmolarity is about 1000 mOsml Small amounts of other substances are found including amino acids at concentrations up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter which are thought to have played a key role in the origin of life Microbial components Research in 1957 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography sampled water in both pelagic and neritic locations in the Pacific Ocean Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates selective effects of the culture media and the presence of inactive cells A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline but not by direct microscopic observation Large numbers of spirillilike forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields In the 1990s improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of DNA enabled researchers taking part in the Census of Marine Life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20000 species Dr Mitchell Sogin from the Marine Biological Laboratory feels that the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million Bacteria are found at all depths in the water column as well as in the sediments some being aerobic others anaerobic Most are freeswimming but some exist as symbionts within other organisms – examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria Cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes enabling the development of stromatolites and oxygen in the atmosphere Some bacteria interact with diatoms and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean One anaerobic species Thiomargarita namibiensis plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulphide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the Benguela Current upwelling zone eventually falling to the seafloor Bacterialike Archaea surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments such as the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor Alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Vibrio spp survive in a pH range of 73 to 106 while some species will grow only at pH 10 to 106 Archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the oceans biomass clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes In 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of Archaea that breaks down methane an important greenhouse gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming Some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor influencing seawater chemistry Oil spills and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life The protist dinoflagellates may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or red tides often after humancaused pollution The process may produce metabolites known as biotoxins which move along the ocean food chain tainting higherorder animal consumers Pandoravirus salinus a species of very large virus with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species was discovered in 2013 Like the other very large viruses Mimivirus and Megavirus Pandoravirus infects amoebas but its genome containing 19 to 25 megabases of DNA is twice as large as that of Megavirus and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure In 2013 researchers from Aberdeen University announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches hoping to find the next generation of antibiotics anticipating an antibiotic apocalypse with a dearth of new infectionfighting drugs The EUfunded research will start in the Atacama Trench and then move on to search trenches off New Zealand and Antarctica The ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material While this may be true on a small scale the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems and rendered them lifethreatening Pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters such as Escherichia coli Vibrio cholerae the cause of cholera hepatitis A hepatitis E and polio along with protozoans causing giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis These pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged Origin Scientific theories behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir Edmond Halley in 1715 who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground Upon reaching the ocean these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time see Hydrologic cycle Halley noted that most lakes that dont have ocean outlets such as the Dead Sea and the Caspian Sea see endorheic basin have high salt content Halley termed this process continental weathering Halleys theory was partly correct In addition sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed The presence of salts other dominant ion chloride results from outgassing of chloride as hydrochloric acid with other gases from Earths interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years most likely as a consequence of a chemicaltectonic system which removes as much salt as is deposited for instance sodium and chloride sinks include evaporite deposits porewater burial and reactions with seafloor basalts Human impacts Climate change rising atmospheric carbon dioxide excess nutrients and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record Major trends include an increasing acidity reduced subsurface oxygen in both nearshore and pelagic waters rising coastal nitrogen levels and widespread increases in mercury and persistent organic pollutants Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion fertilizer and industrial activity Concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources One of the most striking features of this is ocean acidification resulting from increased CO2 uptake of the oceans related to higher atmospheric concentration of CO2 and higher temperatures because it severely affects coral reefs and crustaceans see coral bleaching Human consumption Main article Sea water poisoning See also Desalination Accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water However drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt via urine than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself The renal system actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 gL 09 by weight In most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 35 far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process A point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations 2 is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations so that there is no benefit in drinking such water Drinking seawater temporarily increases bloods NaCl concentration This signals the kidney to excrete sodium but seawaters sodium concentration is above the kidneys maximum concentrating ability Eventually the bloods sodium concentration rises to toxic levels removing water from cells and interfering with nerve conduction ultimately producing fatal seizure and cardiac arrhythmia Survival manuals consistently advise against drinking seawater A summary of 163 life raft voyages estimated the risk of death at 39 for those who drank seawater compared to 3 for those who did not The effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated The temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking This frustration was described famously by a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridges The Rime of the Ancient Mariner Although humans cannot survive on seawater some people claim that up to two cups a day mixed with fresh water in a 23 ratio produces no ill effect The French physician Alain Bombard survived an ocean crossing in a small Zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat which contains about 40 percent water like most living tissues as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean His findings were challenged but an alternative explanation was not given In his 1948 book KonTiki Thor Heyerdahl reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 23 ratio during the 1947 expedition A few years later another adventurer William Willis claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply During the 18th century Richard Russell advocated the practices medical use in the UK and René Quinton expanded the advocation of the practice other countries notably France in the 20th century Currently the practice is widely used in Nicaragua and other countries supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries Most oceangoing vessels desalinate potable water from seawater using processes such as vacuum distillation or multistage flash distillation in an evaporator or more recently by reverse osmosis These energyintensive processes were not usually available during the Age of Sail Larger sailing warships with large crews such as Nelsons HMS Victory were fitted with distilling apparatuses in their galleys Animals such as fish whales sea turtles and seabirds such as penguins and albatrosses can adapt to a high saline habitat For example the kidney of the desert rat can concentrate sodium far more efficiently than the human kidney Standard ASTM International has an international standard for artificial seawater ASTM D114198 Original Standard ASTM D114152 It is used in many research testing labs as a reproducible solution for seawater such as tests on corrosion oil contamination and detergency evaluation See also Listen to this article infodl
