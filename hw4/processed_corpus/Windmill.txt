 For other uses see Windmill disambiguation A windmill is a mill that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades Centuries ago windmills usually were used to mill grain pump water or both Thus they often were gristmills windpumps or both The majority of modern windmills take the form of wind turbines used to generate electricity or windpumps used to pump water either for land drainage or to extract groundwater Windmills in antiquity The windwheel of the Greek engineer Heron of Alexandria in the first century is the earliest known instance of using a winddriven wheel to power a machine Another early example of a winddriven wheel was the prayer wheel which has been used in Tibet and China since the fourth century It has been claimed that the Babylonian emperor Hammurabi planned to use wind power for his ambitious irrigation project in the seventeenth century BCE Horizontal windmills The first practical windmills had sails that rotated in a horizontal plane around a vertical axis According to Ahmad Y alHassan these panemone windmills were invented in eastern Persia as recorded by the Persian geographer Estakhri in the ninth century The authenticity of an earlier anecdote of a windmill involving the second caliph Umar AD 634–644 is questioned on the grounds that it appears in a tenthcentury document Made of six to 12 sails covered in reed matting or cloth material these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water and were quite different from the later European vertical windmills Windmills were in widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia and later spread to China and India from there A similar type of horizontal windmill with rectangular blades used for irrigation can also be found in thirteenthcentury China during the Jurchen Jin dynasty in the north introduced by the travels of Yelü Chucai to Turkestan in 1219 Horizontal windmills were built in small numbers in Europe during the 18th and nineteenth centuries for example Fowlers Mill at Battersea in London and Hoopers Mill at Margate in Kent These early modern examples seem not to have been directly influenced by the horizontal windmills of the Middle and Far East but to have been independent inventions by engineers influenced by the Industrial Revolution Vertical windmills Due to a lack of evidence debate occurs among historians as to whether or not Middle Eastern horizontal windmills triggered the original development of European windmills In northwestern Europe the horizontalaxis or vertical windmill so called due to the plane of the movement of its sails is believed to date from the last quarter of the twelfth century in the triangle of northern France eastern England and Flanders The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Europe assumed to have been of the vertical type dates from 1185 in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the Wold overlooking the Humber estuary A number of earlier but less certainly dated twelfthcentury European sources referring to windmills have also been found These earliest mills were used to grind cereals Post mill Main article Post mill The evidence at present is that the earliest type of European windmill was the post mill so named because of the large upright post on which the mills main structure the body or buck is balanced By mounting the body this way the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in northwestern Europe where wind directions are variable The body contains all the milling machinery The first post mills were of the sunken type where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it Later a wooden support was developed called the trestle This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the nineteenth century when more powerful tower and smock mills replaced them Hollowpost mill In a hollowpost mill the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out to accommodate the drive shaft This makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind Hollowpost mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the fourteenth century onwards Tower mill Main article Tower mill By the end of the thirteenth century the masonry tower mill on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill had been introduced The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power though they were more expensive to build In contrast to the post mill only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind so the main structure can be made much taller allowing the sails to be made longer which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a fantail a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails at the rear of the windmill These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and Englishspeaking countries of the former British Empire Denmark and Germany but rare in other places Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea tower mills with fixed caps were built because the winds direction varied little most of the time Smock mill Main article Smock mill The smock mill is a later development of the tower mill where the tower is replaced by a wooden framework called the smock The smock is commonly of octagonal plan though examples with more or fewer sides exist The smock is thatched boarded or covered by other materials such as slate sheet metal or tar paper The lighter construction in comparison to tower mills make smock mills practical as drainage mills as these often had to be built in areas with unstable subsoil Having originated as a drainage mill smock mills are also used for a variety of purposes When used in a builtup area it is often placed on a masonry base to raise it above the surrounding buildings Mechanics Sails Main article Windmill sail Common sails consist of a lattice framework on which a sailcloth is spread The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the amount of wind available and power needed In medieval mills the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder type arrangement of sails Postmedieval mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread while in colder climates the cloth was replaced by wooden slats which were easier to handle in freezing conditions The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar In all cases the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene culminating in patent sails invented by William Cubitt in 1807 In these sails the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters In France PierreThéophile Berton invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning In the twentieth century increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights The majority of windmills have four sails Multiplesailed mills with five six or eight sails were built in Great Britain especially in and around the counties of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Germany and less commonly elsewhere Earlier multiplesailed mills are found in Spain Portugal Greece parts of Romania Bulgaria and Russia A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail and the one opposite removed without resulting in an unbalanced mill In the Netherlands the stationary position of the sails ie when the mill is not working has long been used to give signals A slight tilt of the sails before the main building signals joy while a tilt after the building signals mourning Across the Netherlands windmills were placed in mourning position in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown Machinery Main article Mill machinery Gears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft Windshafts can be wholly made of wood or wood with a cast iron poll end where the sails are mounted or entirely of cast iron The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearing It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft In grist mills the great spur wheel lower down the upright shaft drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone Post mills sometimes have a head andor tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly instead of the spur gear arrangement Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery The machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain A drainage mill uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes screw Sawmills use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes including papermills threshing mills and to process oil seeds wool paints and stone products

land drainage 1813 technical drawing Spread and decline In the 14th century windmills became popular in Europe the total number of windpowered mills is estimated to have been around 200000 at its peak in 1850 which is modest compared to some 500000 waterwheels Windmills were applied in regions where there was too little water where rivers freeze in winter and in flat lands where the flow of the river was too slow to provide the required power With the coming of the industrial revolution the importance of wind and water as primary industrial energy sources declined and were eventually replaced by steam in steam mills and internal combustion engines although windmills continued to be built in large numbers until late in the nineteenth century More recently windmills have been preserved for their historic value in some cases as static exhibits when the antique machinery is too fragile to put in motion and in other cases as fully working mills Of the 10000 windmills in use in the Netherlands around 1850 about 1000 are still standing Most of these are being run by volunteers though some grist mills are still operating commercially Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as backup to the modern pumping stations The Zaan district has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating windpowered industries by the end of the eighteenth century Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills so only very few are left Construction of mills spread to the Cape Colony in the seventeenth century The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the Cape Peninsula so in 1717 the Heeren XVII sent carpenters masons and materials to construct a durable mill The mill completed in 1718 became known as the Oude Molen and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River Long since demolished its name lives on as that of a Technical school in Pinelands By 1863 Cape Town could boast 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to Mowbray Wind turbines Main articles Wind power and Highaltitude wind power A wind turbine is a windmilllike structure specifically developed to generate electricity They can be seen as the next step in the development of the windmill The first wind turbines were built by the end of the nineteenth century by Prof James Blyth in Scotland 1887 Charles F Brush in Cleveland Ohio 1887–1888 and Poul la Cour in Denmark 1890s La Cours mill from 1896 later became the local powerplant of the village Askov By 1908 there were 72 winddriven electric generators in Denmark ranging from 5 to 25 kW By the 1930s windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed built by companies such as Jacobs Wind Wincharger Miller Airlite Universal Aeroelectric ParisDunn Airline and Winpower The Dunlite Corporation produced turbines for similar locations in Australia Forerunners of modern horizontalaxis utilityscale wind generators were the WIME3D in service in Balaklava USSR from 1931 until 1942 a 100kW generator on a 30m 100ft tower the SmithPutnam wind turbine built in 1941 on the mountain known as Grandpas Knob in Castleton Vermont United States of 125 MW and the NASA wind turbines developed from 1974 through the mid1980s The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the wind turbine design technologies in use today including steel tube towers variablespeed generators composite blade materials and partialspan pitch control as well as aerodynamic structural and acoustic engineering design capabilities The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant Vestas Nordtank and Bonus These early turbines were small by todays standards with capacities of 20–30 kW each Since then commercial turbines have increased greatly in size with the Enercon E126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries As the 21st century began rising concerns over energy security global warming and eventual fossil fuel depletion led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of renewable energy Worldwide many thousands of wind turbines are now operating with a total nameplate capacity of 194400 MW Europe accounted for 48 of the total in 2009 Windpumps Main article Windpump Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now Afghanistan Iran and Pakistan The use of wind pumps became widespread across the Muslim world and later spread to China and India Windmills were later used extensively in Europe particularly in the Netherlands and the East Anglia area of Great Britain from the late Middle Ages onwards to drain land for agricultural or building purposes The American windmill or wind engine was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells Larger versions were also used for tasks such as sawing wood chopping hay and shelling and grinding grain In early California and some other states the windmill was part of a selfcontained domestic water system which included a handdug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction At their peak in 1930 an estimated 600000 units were in use Firms such as US Wind Engine and Pump Company Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company Appleton Manufacturing Company Star Eclipse FairbanksMorse Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States Canada Southern Africa and Australia They feature a large number of blades so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are selfregulating in high winds A towertop gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills saw mills and agricultural machinery In Australia the Griffiths Brothers at Toowoomba manufactured windmills of the American pattern from 1876 with the trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903 These became an icon of the Australian rural sector by utilizing the water of the Great Artesian Basin Another wellknown maker
