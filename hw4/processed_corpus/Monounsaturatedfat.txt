 For a discussion on how dietary fats affect cardiovascular health see Diet and heart disease In biochemistry and nutrition monounsaturated fatty acids abbreviated MUFAs or more plainly monounsaturated fats are fatty acids that have one double bond in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder carbon atoms being singlebonded By contrast polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs have more than one double bond Fatty acids are longchained molecules having an alkyl group at one end and a carboxylic acid group at the other end Fatty acid viscosity thickness and melting temperature increases with decreasing number of double bonds therefore monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids more double bonds and a lower melting point than saturated fatty acids no double bonds Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated Molecular description of monounsaturated fatty acids Common monounsaturated fatty acids are palmitoleic acid 161 n−7 cisvaccenic acid 181 n−7 and oleic acid 181 n−9 Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end It can be lengthened to the 18carbon cisvaccenic acid Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a spacefilling model Relation to health Polyunsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more membrane fluidity than monounsaturated fats but they are more vulnerable to lipid peroxidation rancidity The large scale KANWU study found that increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low However some monounsaturated fatty acids in the same way as saturated fats may promote insulin resistance whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective against insulin resistance Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure More physical activity was associated with a higheroleic acid diet than one of a palmitic acid diet From the study it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability Foods containing monounsaturated fats reduce lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol while possibly increasing highdensity lipoprotein HDL cholesterol However their true ability to raise HDL is still in debate Levels of oleic along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with breast cancer risk The saturation index SI of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme delta9 desaturase Δ9d In children consumption of monounsaturated oils is associated with healthier serum lipid profiles The Mediterranean Diet is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats People in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries but most of the fat is in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega3 fatty acids from fish vegetables and certain meats like lamb while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison The diet in Crete is fairly high in total fat 40 of total calories almost exclusively provided by olive oil yet affords a remarkable protection from coronary heart disease and probably colon cancer but unlikely from breast cancer due to a very high oleic acid content Natural sources Monounsaturated fats are found in natural foods such as red meat whole milk products nuts and high fat fruits such as olives and avocados Olive oil is about 75 monounsaturated fat The high oleic variety sunflower oil contains as much as 85 monounsaturated fat Canola oil and Cashews are both about 58 monounsaturated fat Tallow beef fat is about 50 monounsaturated fat and lard is about 40 monounsaturated fat Other sources include avocado oil macadamia nut oil grapeseed oil groundnut oil peanut oil sesame oil corn oil popcorn whole grain wheat cereal oatmeal safflower oil almond oil sunflower oil hemp oil and teaoil Camellia Fat composition in different foods click at right to hide or show  view talk edit See also High density lipoprotein Saturated fat Unsaturated fat Polyunsaturated fat Fatty acid synthesis References External links Fats Mayo Clinic The Chemistry of Unsaturated Fats
