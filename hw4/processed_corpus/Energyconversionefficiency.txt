 Energy conversion efficiency η is the ratio between the useful output of an energy conversion machine and the input in energy terms The input as well as the useful output may be electric power mechanical work light radiation or heat Overview Energy conversion efficiency is not defined uniquely but instead depends on the usefulness of the output All or part of the heat produced from burning a fuel may become rejected waste heat if for example work is the desired output from a thermodynamic cycle Energy converter is an example of an energy transformation For example a light bulb falls into the categories energy converter η P o u t P i n displaystyle eta frac Pmathrm out Pmathrm in Even though the definition includes the notion of usefulness efficiency is considered a technical or physical term Goal or mission oriented terms include effectiveness and efficacy Generally energy conversion efficiency is a dimensionless number between 0 and 10 or 0 to 100 Efficiencies may not exceed 100 eg for a perpetual motion machine However other effectiveness measures that can exceed 10 are used for heat pumps and other devices that move heat rather than convert it When talking about the efficiency of heat engines and power stations the convention should be stated ie HHV aka Gross Heating Value etc or LCV aka Net Heating value and whether gross output at the generator terminals or net output at the power station fence are being considered The two are separate but both must be stated Failure to do so causes endless confusion Related more specific terms include Electrical efficiency useful power output per electrical power consumed Mechanical efficiency where one form of mechanical energy eg potential energy of water is converted to mechanical energy work Thermal efficiency or Fuel efficiency useful heat andor work output per input energy such as the fuel consumed Total efficiency eg for cogeneration useful electric power and heat output per fuel energy consumed Same as the thermal efficiency Luminous efficiency that portion of the emitted electromagnetic radiation is usable for human vision Fuel heating values and efficiency In Europe the usable energy content of fuel is typically calculated using the lower heating value LHV of that fuel the definition of which assumes that the water vapor produced during fuel combustion oxidation remains gaseous and is not condensed to liquid water so the latent heat of vaporization of that water is not usable Using the LHV a condensing boiler can achieve a heating efficiency in excess of 100 this does not violate the first law of thermodynamics as long as the LHV convention is understood but does cause confusion This is because the apparatus recovers part of the heat of vaporization which is not included in the definition of the lower heating value of fuel In the US and elsewhere the higher heating value HHV is used which includes the latent heat for condensing the water vapor and thus the thermodynamic maximum of 100 efficiency cannot be exceeded with HHVs use Example of energy conversion efficiency See also Cost of electricity by source Energy efficiency disambiguation EROEI Exergy efficiency Figure of merit Heat of combustion International Electrotechnical Commission Perpetual motion Sensitivity electronics Solar cell efficiency Coefficient of performance References External links The Intelligent Energy Europe programme the EUs tool for funding action towards a more energy intelligent Europe Does it make sense to switch to LED
