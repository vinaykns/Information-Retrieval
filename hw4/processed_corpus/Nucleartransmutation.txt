 Nuclear transmutation is the conversion of one chemical element or an isotope into another Because any element or isotope of one is defined by its number of protons and neutrons in its atoms ie in the atomic nucleus nuclear transmutation occurs in any process where the number of protons or neutrons in the nucleus is changed A transmutation can be achieved either by nuclear reactions in which an outside particle reacts with a nucleus or by radioactive decay where no outside cause is needed Natural transmutation by stellar nucleosynthesis in the past created most of the heavier chemical elements in the universe One type of natural transmutation observable in the present occurs when certain radioactive elements present in nature spontaneously decay by a process that causes transmutation such as alpha or beta decay An example is the natural decay of potassium40 to argon40 which forms most of the argon in the air Also on Earth natural transmutations from the different mechanisms of natural nuclear reactions occur due to cosmic ray bombardment of elements for example to form carbon14 and also occasionally from natural neutron bombardment for example see natural nuclear fission reactor Artificial transmutation may occur in machinery that has enough energy to cause changes in the nuclear structure of the elements Such machines include particle accelerators and tokamak reactors Conventional fission power reactors also cause artificial transmutation not from the power of the machine but by exposing elements to neutrons produced by fission from an artificially produced nuclear chain reaction For instance when a uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons fission takes place This releases on average 3 neutrons and a large amount of energy The released neutrons then cause fission of other uranium atoms until all of the available uranium is exhausted This is called a chain reaction Artificial nuclear transmutation has been considered as a possible mechanism for reducing the volume and hazard of radioactive waste History Alchemy The term transmutation dates back to alchemy Alchemists pursued the philosophers stone capable of chrysopoeia – the transformation of base metals into gold While alchemists often understood chrysopoeia as a metaphor for a mystical or religious process some practitioners adopted a literal interpretation and tried to make gold through physical experiment The impossibility of the metallic transmutation had been debated amongst alchemists philosophers and scientists since the Middle Ages Pseudoalchemical transmutation was outlawed and publicly mocked beginning in the fourteenth century Alchemists like Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath wrote tracts exposing fraudulent claims of gold making By the 1720s there were no longer any respectable figures pursuing the physical transmutation of substances into gold Antoine Lavoisier in the 18th century replaced the alchemical theory of elements with the modern theory of chemical elements and John Dalton further developed the notion of atoms from the alchemical theory of corpuscles to explain various chemical processes The disintegration of atoms is a distinct process involving much greater energies than could be achieved by alchemists Modern physics It was first consciously applied to modern physics by Frederick Soddy when he along with Ernest Rutherford discovered that radioactive thorium was converting itself into radium in 1901 At the moment of realization Soddy later recalled he shouted out Rutherford this is transmutation Rutherford snapped back For Christs sake Soddy dont call it transmutation Theyll have our heads off as alchemists Rutherford and Soddy were observing natural transmutation as a part of radioactive decay of the alpha decay type However in 1919 Rutherford was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen using alpha particles directed at nitrogen N α → O p  This was the first observation of a nuclear reaction that is a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus Eventually in 1932 a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherfords colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium7 to split the nucleus into two alpha particles The feat was popularly known as splitting the atom although it was not the modern nuclear fission reaction discovered in 1938 by Otto Hahn Lise Meitner and their assistant Fritz Strassmann in heavy elements Later in the twentieth century the transmutation of elements within stars was elaborated accounting for the relative abundance of heavier elements in the universe Save for the first five elements which were produced in the Big Bang and other cosmic ray processes stellar nucleosynthesis accounted for the abundance of all elements heavier than boron In their 1957 paper Synthesis of the Elements in Stars William Alfred Fowler Margaret Burbidge Geoffrey Burbidge and Fred Hoyle explained how the abundances of essentially all but the lightest chemical elements could be explained by the process of nucleosynthesis in stars It transpired that under true nuclear transmutation it is far easier to turn gold into lead than the reverse reaction which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued Nuclear experiments have successfully transmuted lead into gold but the expense far exceeds any gain It would be easier to convert gold into lead via neutron capture and beta decay by leaving gold in a nuclear reactor for a long period of time Glenn Seaborg produced several thousand atoms of gold from bismuth but at a net loss More information on gold synthesis see Synthesis of precious metals Au n → Au halflife 27 days → Hg n → Hg n → Hg n → Hg n → Hg n → Hg halflife 47 days → Tl n → Tl halflife 38 years → Pb Transmutation in the universe Main article nucleosynthesis The Big Bang is thought to be the origin of the hydrogen including all deuterium and helium in the universe Hydrogen and helium together account for 98 of the mass of ordinary matter in the universe while the other two makes up everything else The Big Bang also produced small amounts of lithium beryllium and perhaps boron More lithium beryllium and boron were produced later in a natural nuclear reaction cosmic ray spallation Stellar nucleosynthesis is responsible for all of the other elements occurring naturally in the universe as stable isotopes and primordial nuclide from carbon to plutonium These occurred after the Big Bang during star formation Some lighter elements from carbon to iron were formed in stars and released into space by asymptotic giant branch AGB stars These are a type of red giant that puffs off its outer atmosphere containing some elements from carbon to nickel and iron All elements with atomic weight greater than 64 atomic mass units are produced in supernova stars by means of nuclear reaction of lighter nuclei called neutron capture which subdivides into two processes rprocess and sprocess The Solar System is thought to have condensed approximately 46 billion years before the present from a cloud of hydrogen and helium containing heavier elements in dust grains formed previously by a large number of such stars These grains contained the heavier elements formed by transmutation earlier in the history of the universe All of these natural processes of transmutation in stars are continuing today in our own galaxy and in others Stars fuse hydrogen and helium into heavier and heavier elements in order to produce energy For example the observed light curves of supernova stars such as SN 1987A show them blasting large amounts comparable to the mass of Earth of radioactive nickel and cobalt into space However little of this material reaches Earth Most natural transmutation on the Earth today is mediated by cosmic rays such as production of carbon14 and by the radioactive decay of radioactive primordial nuclides left over from the initial formation of the solar system such as potassium40 uranium and thorium plus the radioactive decay of products of these nucleides radium radon polonium etc See decay chain Artificial transmutation of nuclear waste Overview Transmutation of transuranium elements TRUs ie actinides minus actinium to uranium such as the isotopes of plutonium about 1wt in the Light Water Reactors used nuclear fuel UNF or the minor actinides MAs ie neptunium americium and curium about 01wt each in LWRs UNF has the potential to help solve some problems posed by the management of radioactive waste by reducing the proportion of longlived isotopes it contains This does not ruleout the need for a Deep Geological Repository DGR for High radioactive Level Waste HLW When irradiated with fast neutrons in a nuclear reactor these isotopes can undergo nuclear fission destroying the original actinide isotope and producing a spectrum of radioactive and nonradioactive fission products Ceramic targets containing actinides can be bombarded with neutrons to induce transmutation reactions to remove the most difficult longlived species These can consist of actinidecontaining solid solutions such as AmZrN AmYN ZrCmO2 ZrCmAmO2 ZrAmYO2 or just actinide phases such as AmO2 NpO2 NpN AmN mixed with some inert phases such as MgO MgAl2O4 ZrYO2 TiN and ZrN The role of nonradioactive inert phases is mainly to provide stable mechanical behaviour to the target under neutron irradiation Reactor types For instance plutonium can be reprocessed into MOX fuels and transmuted in standard reactors The heavier elements could be transmuted in fast reactors but probably more effectively in a subcritical reactor which is sometimes known as an energy amplifier and which was devised by Carlo Rubbia Fusion neutron sources have also been proposed as well suited Fuel types There are several fuels that can incorporate plutonium in their initial composition at beginning of cycle BOC and have a smaller amount of this element at the end of cycle EOC During the cycle plutonium can be burnt in a power reactor generating electricity This process is not only interesting from a power generation standpoint but also due to its capability of consuming the surplus weapons grade plutonium from the weapons program and plutonium resulting of reprocessing UNF Mixed oxide fuel MOX is one of these Its blend of oxides of plutonium and uranium constitutes an alternative to the low enriched uranium LEU fuel predominantly used in LWRs Since uranium is present in MOX although plutonium will be burnt second generation plutonium will be produced through the radiative capture of U238 and the two subsequent beta minus decays Fuels with plutonium and thorium are also an option In these the neutrons released in the fission of plutonium are captured by Th232 After this radiative capture Th232 becomes Th233 which undergoes two beta minus decays resulting in the production of the fissile isotope U233 The radiative capture cross section for Th232 is more than three times that of U238 yielding a higher conversion to fissile fuel than that from U238 Due to the absence of uranium in the fuel there is no second generation plutonium produced and the amount of plutonium burnt will be higher than in MOX fuels However U233 which is fissile will be present in the UNF Weaponsgrade and reactorgrade plutonium can be used in plutoniumthorium fuels with weaponsgrade plutonium being the one that shows a bigger reduction in the amount of Pu239 Reasoning behind transmutation Isotopes of plutonium and other actinides tend to be longlived with halflives of many thousands of years whereas radioactive fission products tend to be shorterlived most with halflives of 30 years or less From a waste management viewpoint transmutation or burning or incineration of actinides eliminates a very longterm radioactive hazard and replaces it with a much shorterterm one It is important to understand that the threat posed by a radioisotope is influenced by many factors including the physical eg heat infrared photon radiation which is an advantage for the storage or disposal af radioactive waste chemical and biological properties of the element For instance caesium has a relatively short biological halflife 1 to 4 months while strontium and radium both have very long biological halflives As a result strontium90 and radium are much more able to cause harm than caesium137 when a given activity is ingested Insert a brief calculation of doses Many of the actinides are very radiotoxic because they have long biological halflives and are alpha emitters In transmutation the intention is to convert the actinides into fission products The fission products are very radioactive but the majority of the activity will decay away within a short time The most worrying shortlived fission products are those that accumulate in the body such as iodine131 which accumulates in the thyroid gland but it is hoped that by good design of the nuclear fuel and transmutation plant that such fission products can be isolated from humans and their environment and allowed to decay In the medium term the fission products of highest concern are strontium90 and caesium137 both have a halflife of about 30 years The caesium137 is responsible for the majority of the external gamma dose experienced by workers in nuclear reprocessing plants and in 2005 to workers at the Chernobyl site When these mediumlived isotopes have decayed almost completely usually after 10 halflives the remaining isotopes will pose a much smaller threat Longlived fission products LLFP Some radioactive fission products can be converted into shorterlived radioisotopes by transmutation Transmutation of all fission products with halflife greater than one year is studied in Grenoble with varying results Sr90 and Cs137 with halflives of about 30 years are the largest radiation including heat emitters in used nuclear fuel on a scale of decades to 305 years Sn121m is insignificant because of the low yield and are not easily transmuted because they have low neutron absorption cross sections Instead they should simply be stored until they decay Given that this length of storage is necessary the fission products with shorter halflives can also be stored until they decay The next longerlived fission product is Sm151 which has a halflife of 90 years and is such a good neutron absorber that most of it is transmuted while the nuclear fuel is still being used however effectively transmuting the remaining Sm151 in nuclear waste would require separation from other isotopes of samarium Given the smaller quantities and its lowenergy radioactivity Sm151 is less dangerous than Sr90 and Cs137 and can also be left to decay for 970 years Finally there are 7 longlived fission products They have much longer halflives in the range 211000 years to 157 million years Two of them Tc99 and I129 are mobile enough in the environment to be potential dangers are free or mostly free of mixture with stable isotopes of the same element and have neutron cross sections that are small but adequate to support transmutation Also Tc99 can substitute for U238 in supplying Doppler broadening for negative feedback for reactor stability Most studies of proposed transmutation schemes have assumed Tc I and TRUs as the targets for transmutation with other fission products activation products and possibly reprocessed uranium remaining as waste Of the remaining 5 longlived fission products Se79 Sn126 and Pd107 are produced only in small quantities at least in todays thermal neutron U235burning light water reactors and the last two should be relatively inert The other two Zr93 and Cs135 are produced in larger quantities but also not highly mobile in the environment They are also mixed with larger quantities of other isotopes of the same element See also
