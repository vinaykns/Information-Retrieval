Cuba help·info is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean meet It is south of both the US state of Florida and the Bahamas west of Haiti and north of Jamaica Havana is the largest city and capital other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean with an area of 109884 square kilometres 42426 sq mi and the secondmost populous after Hispaniola with over 11 million inhabitants Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century Cuba was inhabited by Amerindian tribes It remained a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898 which led to nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 As a fragile republic Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952 Further unrest and instability led to Batistas ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement which afterwards established a government under the leadership of Fidel Castro Since 1965 the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba A point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 Culturally Cuba is considered part of Latin America It is a multiethnic country whose people culture and customs derive from diverse origins including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples the long period of Spanish colonialism the introduction of African slaves and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War Cuba is a Marxist–Leninist oneparty republic where the role of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution Independent observers have accused the Cuban government of numerous human rights abuses including arbitrary imprisonment It is one of the worlds last planned economies and its economy is dominated by the exports of sugar tobacco coffee and skilled labor According to the Human Development Index Cuba is described as a country with high human development and is ranked the eighth highest in North America It also ranks highly in some metrics of national performance including health care and education Etymology The name Cuba comes from the Taíno language The exact meaning of the name is unclear but it may be translated either as where fertile land is abundant cubao or great place coabana Authors who believe that Christopher Columbus was Portuguese state that Cuba was named by Columbus for the town of Cuba in the district of Beja in Portugal History Main articles History of Cuba and Timeline of Cuban history Prehistory Before the arrival of the Spanish Cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of indigenous peoples of the Americas The Taíno an Arawak people the Guanajatabey and the Ciboney people The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland of South America with the earliest sites dated to 5000 BP The Taíno arrived from Hispanola sometime in the 3rd century AD When Columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in Cuba having an estimated population of 150000 The name Cuba comes from the native Taíno language It is derived from either coabana meaning great place or from cubao meaning where fertile land is abundant The Taíno were farmers while the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and huntergatherers Spanish colonization and rule 1492–1898 Main article Captaincy General of Cuba After first landing on an island then called Guanahani Bahamas on October 12 1492 Christopher Columbus commanded his three ships La Pinta La Niña and the Santa María to land on Cubas northeastern coast on October 28 1492 This was near what is now Bariay Holguín Province Columbus claimed the island for the new Kingdom of Spain and named it Isla Juana after Juan Prince of Asturias In 1511 the first Spanish settlement was founded by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar at Baracoa Other towns soon followed including San Cristobal de la Habana founded in 1515 which later became the capital The native Taíno were forced to work under the encomienda system which resembled a feudal system in Medieval Europe Within a century the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to multiple factors primarily Eurasian infectious diseases to which they had no natural resistance immunity aggravated by harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation In 1529 a measles outbreak in Cuba killed twothirds of those few natives who had previously survived smallpox On May 18 1539 Conquistador Hernando de Soto departed from Havana Cuba at the head of some 600 followers into a vast expedition through the Southeastern United States starting at La Florida in search of gold treasure fame and power On September 1 1548 Dr Gonzalo Perez de Angulo was appointed governor of Cuba He arrived in Santiago Cuba on November 4 1549 and immediately declared the liberty of all natives He became Cubas first permanent governor to reside in Havana instead of Santiago and he built Havanas first church made of masonry After the French took Havana in 1555 the governors son Francisco de Angulo went to Mexico Cuba developed slowly and unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean had a diversified agriculture But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire By the mid18th century its colonists held 50000 slaves compared to 60000 in Barbados 300000 in Virginia both British colonies and 450000 in French SaintDomingue which had largescale sugar cane plantations The Seven Years War which erupted in 1754 across three continents eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean Spains alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British and in 1762 a British expedition of five warships and 4000 troops set out from Portsmouth to capture Cuba The British arrived on June 6 and by August had Havana under siege When Havana surrendered the admiral of the British fleet George Keppel the 3rd Earl of Albemarle entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society They imported food horses and other goods into the city as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the under developed sugar plantations Though Havana which had become the thirdlargest city in the Americas was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period the British occupation of the city proved shortlived Pressure from London sugar merchants fearing a decline in sugar prices forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories Less than a year after Britain seized Havana it signed the Peace of Paris together with France and Spain ending the Seven Years War The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for Cuba The French had recommended this to Spain advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British Many in Britain were disappointed believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and Britains other gains in the war The real engine for the growth of Cubas commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the Haitian Revolution When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbeans richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt Cuban planters perceived the regions changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba too and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety The planters saw opportunity however because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugarproducing pearl of the Antilles that Haiti had been before the revolution As the historian Ada Ferrer has written At a basic level liberation in SaintDomingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba As slavery and colonialism collapsed in the French colony the Spanish island underwent transformations that were almost the mirror image of Haitis Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820 some 325000 Africans were imported to Cuba as slaves which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790 Although a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved at times slaves arose in revolt In 1812 the Aponte Slave Rebellion took place but it was suppressed The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630980 of which 291021 were white 115691 free people of color mixedrace and 224268 black slaves This was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in Virginia for instance or the other Caribbean islands Historians such as Swedish Magnus Mõrner who studied slavery in Latin America found that manumissions increased when slave economies were in decline as in 18thcentury Cuba and early 19thcentury Maryland of the United States In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings by the 19th century there had developed the practice of coartacion or buying oneself out of slavery a uniquely Cuban development according to historian Herbert S Klein Due to a shortage of white labor blacks dominated urban industries to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century they were unable to displace Negro workers A system of diversified agriculture with small farms and fewer slaves served to supply the cities with produce and other goods In the 1820s when the rest of Spains empire in Latin America rebelled and formed independent states Cuba remained loyal Its economy was based on serving the empire By 1860 Cuba had 213167 free people of color 39 of its nonWhite population of 550000 By contrast Virginia with about the same number of blacks had only 58042 or 11 who were free the rest were enslaved In the antebellum years Virginia discouraged manumissions after the Nat Turners Slave Rebellion of 1831 and strengthened restrictions against free blacks as did other southern states In addition there was a high demand for slaves and Virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade to be shipped or taken overland to the Deep South which had greatly expanded its cotton production Independence movements See also Cuban War of Independence Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter Carlos Manuel de Céspedes De Céspedes a sugar planter freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba On December 27 1868 he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years War Two thousand Cuban Chinese joined the rebels Chinese had been imported as indentured laborers A monument in Havana honours the Cuban Chinese who fell in the war The United States declined to recognize the new Cuban government although many European and Latin American nations did so In 1878 the Pact of Zanjón ended the conflict with Spain promising greater autonomy to Cuba In 1879–1880 Cuban patriot Calixto García attempted to start another war known as the Little War but did not receive enough support Slavery in Cuba was abolished in 1875 but the process was completed only in 1886 An exiled dissident named José Martí founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York in 1892 The aim of the party was to achieve Cuban independence from Spain In January 1895 Martí traveled to Montecristi and Santo Domingo to join the efforts of Máximo Gómez Martí recorded his political views in the Manifesto of Montecristi Fighting against the Spanish army began in Cuba on February 24 1895 but Martí was unable to reach Cuba until April 11 1895 Martí was killed in the battle of Dos Rios on May 19 1895 His death immortalized him as Cubas national hero Around 200000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army which relied mostly on guerrilla and sabotage tactics The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression General Valeriano Weyler military governor of Cuba herded the rural population into what he called reconcentrados described by international observers as fortified towns These are often considered the prototype for 20thcentury concentration camps Between 200000 and 400000 Cuban civilians died from starvation and disease in the camps numbers verified by the Red Cross and United States Senator Redfield Proctor a former Secretary of War American and European protests against Spanish conduct on the island followed The US battleship Maine was sent to protect US interests but soon after arrival it exploded in Havana harbor and sank quickly killing nearly three quarters of the crew The cause and responsibility for the sinking of the ship remained unclear after a board of inquiry Popular opinion in the US fueled by an active press concluded that the Spanish were to blame and demanded action Spain and the United States declared war on each other in late April 1898 Over the decades five US presidents—Polk Pierce Buchanan Grant and McKinley—had tried to buy the island of Cuba from Spain Independence 1902–59 Main article History of Cuba 1902–59 After the Spanish–American War Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris 1898 by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico the Philippines and Guam to the United States for the sum of US20 million Cuba gained formal independence from the US on May 20 1902 as the Republic of Cuba Under Cubas new constitution the US retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations Under the Platt Amendment the US leased the Guantánamo Bay naval base from Cuba Following disputed elections in 1906 the first president Tomás Estrada Palma faced an armed revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government forces The US intervened by occupying Cuba and named Charles Edward Magoon as Governor for three years Cuban historians have characterized Magoons governorship as having introduced political and social corruption In 1908 selfgovernment was restored when José Miguel Gómez was elected President but the US continued intervening in Cuban affairs In 1912 the Partido Independiente de Color attempted to establish a separate black republic in Oriente Province but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed In 1924 Gerardo Machado was elected president During his administration tourism increased markedly and Americanowned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a collapse in the price of sugar political unrest and repression Protesting students known as the Generation of 1930 turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular Machado A general strike in which the Communist Party sided with Machado uprisings among sugar workers and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933 He was replaced by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada In September 1933 the Sergeants Revolt led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista overthrew Cespedes A fivemember executive committee the Pentarchy of 1933 was chosen to head a provisional government Ramón Grau San Martín was then appointed as provisional president Grau resigned in 1934 leaving the way clear for Batista who dominated Cuban politics for the next 25 years at first through a series of puppetpresidents The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of virtually unremitting social and political warfare A new constitution was adopted in 1940 which engineered radical progressive ideas including the right to labour and health care Batista was elected president in the same year holding the post until 1944 He is so far the only nonwhite Cuban to win the nations highest political office His government carried out major social reforms Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War II although president Batista suggested a joint USLatin American assault on Francoist Spain in order to overthrow its authoritarian regime Batista adhered to the 1940 constitutions strictures preventing his reelection Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election in 1944 Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system in particular by undermining the deeply flawed though not entirely ineffectual Congress and Supreme Court Carlos Prío Socarrás a protégé of Grau became president in 1948 The two terms of the Auténtico Party saw an influx of investment which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas After running unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952 Batista staged a coup He outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952 After the coup Cuba had Latin Americas highest per capita consumption rates of meat vegetables cereals automobiles telephones and radios though about one third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption In 1958 Cuba was a relatively welladvanced country by Latin American standards and in some cases by world standards On the other hand Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America including bans on dismissals and mechanization They were obtained in large measure at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants leading to disparities Between 1933 and 1958 Cuba extended economic regulations enormously causing economic problems Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs The middle class which was comparable to that of the United States became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution The labor unions supported Batista until the very end Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958 Revolution and Communist party rule 1959–present Main article Cuban Revolution In the 1950s various organizations including some advocating armed uprising competed for public support in bringing about political change In 1956 Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government It was not until 1958 that Castros July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group By late 1958 the rebels had broken out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general popular insurrection After Castros fighters captured Santa Clara Batista fled with his family to the Dominican Republic on January 1 1959 Later he went into exile on the Portuguese island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril near Lisbon Fidel Castros forces entered the capital on January 8 1959 The liberal Manuel Urrutia Lleó became the provisional president From 1959 to 1966 Cuban insurgents fought a sixyear rebellion in the Escambray Mountains against the Castro government The governments vastly superior numbers eventually crushed the insurgency The rebellion lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the Cuban Revolution The US State Department has estimated that 3200 people were executed from 1959 to 1962 According to Amnesty International death sentences from 1959–87 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were actually carried out Other estimates for the total number of political executions range from 4000 to 33000 The vast majority of those executed following the 1959 revolution were policemen politicians and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the Cuban population The United States government initially reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America Castros legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries The promulgation of the Agrarian Reform Law expropriating thousands of acres of farmland including from large US landholders further worsened relations In response between 1960 and 1964 the US imposed a range of sanctions eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all Cubanowned assets in the US In February 1960 Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet VicePremier Anastas Mikoyan In March 1960 Eisenhower gave his approval to a CIA plan to arm and train a group of Cuban refugees to overthrow the Castro regime The invasion known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion took place on April 14 1961 About 1400 Cuban exiles disembarked at the Bay of Pigs but failed in their attempt to overthrow Castro In January 1962 Cuba was suspended from the Organization of American States OAS and later the same year the OAS started to impose sanctions against Cuba of similar nature to the US sanctions The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred in October 1962 By 1963 Cuba was moving towards a fullfledged Communist system modeled on the USSR During the 1970s Fidel Castro dispatched tens of thousands of troops in support of Sovietsupported wars in Africa He supported the MPLA in Angola and Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia The standard of living in the 1970s was extremely spartan and discontent was rife Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech In 1975 the OAS lifted its sanctions against Cuba with the approval of 16 member states including the US The US however maintained its own sanctions Castros rule was severely tested in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse in 1991 known in Cuba as the Special Period The country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies worth 4 billion to 6 billion annually resulting in effects such as food and fuel shortages The government did not accept American donations of food medicines and cash until 1993 On August 5 1994 state security dispersed protesters in a spontaneous protest in Havana Cuba has since found a new source of aid and support in the Peoples Republic of China In addition Hugo Chávez former President of Venezuela and Evo Morales President of Bolivia became allies and both countries are major oil and gas exporters In 2003 the government arrested and imprisoned a large number of civil activists a period known as the Black Spring In February 2008 Fidel Castro announced his resignation as President of Cuba On February 24 his brother Raúl Castro was declared the new President In his inauguration speech Raúl promised that some of the restrictions on freedom in Cuba would be removed In March 2009 Raúl Castro removed some of his brothers appointees On June 3 2009 the Organization of American States adopted a resolution to end the 47year ban on Cuban membership of the group The resolution stated however that full membership would be delayed until Cuba was in conformity with the practices purposes and principles of the OAS Fidel Castro restated his position that he was not interested in joining after the OAS resolution had been announced Effective January 14 2013 Cuba ended the requirement established in 1961 that any citizens who wish to travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution it approved exit visas only on rare occasions Requirements were simplified Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave and they are allowed to take their young children with them for the first time However a passport costs on average five months salary Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad are most likely to be able to take advantage of the new policy In the first year of the program over 180000 left Cuba and returned As of December 2014 talks with Cuban officials and American officials including President Barack Obama have resulted in the exchange of releasing Alan Gross fiftytwo political prisoners and an unnamed noncitizen agent of the United States in return for the release of three Cuban agents currently imprisoned in the United States Additionally while the embargo between the United States and Cuba will not be immediately lifted it will be relaxed to allow import export and certain commerce within a limit between the two Government and politics Main article Politics of Cuba The Republic of Cuba is one of the worlds last remaining socialist countries following the Marxist–Leninist ideology The Constitution of 1976 which defined Cuba as a socialist

release of all political prisoners The United States continues an embargo against Cuba so long as it continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights though the UN General Assembly has since 1992 passed a resolution every year condemning the ongoing impact of the embargo and claiming it to be in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law Cuba considers the embargo itself to be in violation of human rights On December 17 2014 United States President Barack Obama announced the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba

fourth highest in Latin America Cuba also ranked 11th in the world in the number of doctors per capita Several private clinics and hospitals provided services for the poor Cubas income distribution compared favorably with that of other Latin American societies However income inequality was a profound issue between city and countryside especially between whites and blacks Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside A thriving middle class according to PBS held the promise of prosperity and social mobility According to Cuba historian Louis Perez of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Havana was then what Las Vegas has become After the Cuban revolution and before the collapse of the Soviet Union Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its exports The removal of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid depression known in Cuba as the Special Period Cuba took limited free marketoriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food consumer goods and services These steps included allowing some selfemployment in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors the legalization of the use of the US dollar in business and the encouragement of tourism Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system the organopónicos to compensate for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union Its widely viewed that the US embargo which initiated as a result of discontent with nationalization of UScitizenheld property and later perceived human rights violations hurt the Cuban economy In 2009 the Cuban Government estimated they lost

Castro they will be able to improve their houses with this new permission but the government will not endorse these new houses or improvements There is virtually no homelessness in Cuba and 85 of Cubans own their own homes and pay no property taxes or interest on their mortgages Mortgage payments can’t exceed 10 of the combined household income On August 2 2011 The New York Times reported Cuba as reaffirming their intent to legalize buying and selling of private property before the years end According to experts the private sale of property could transform Cuba more than any of the economic reforms announced by President Raúl Castros government It will cut more than one million state jobs including party bureaucrats who resist the changes The new economic reforms effectively created a new economic system referred by some as the New Cuban Economy In October 2013 Raúl said he intends to merge the two currencies As of August 2016 the dual currency system remains in force In August 2012 a specialist of the Cubaenergia Company announced the opening of Cubas first Solar Power Plant As a member of the Cubasolar Group there was also a mention of 10 additional plants in 2013 Resources Cubas natural resources include sugar tobacco fish citrus fruits coffee beans rice potatoes and livestock The output of Cubas nickel mines that year was 71000 tons approaching 4 of world production As of 2013 its reserves were estimated at 55 million tons over 7 of the world total Sherritt International of Canada operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa Cuba is also a major producer of refined cobalt a byproduct of nickel mining operations Oil exploration in 2005 by the US Geological Survey revealed that the North Cuba Basin could produce about 46 billion barrels 730000000 m to 93 billion barrels 148×10 m of oil In 2006 Cuba started to testdrill these locations for possible exploitation Tourism Main article Tourism in Cuba Tourism was initially restricted to enclave resorts where tourists would be segregated from Cuban society referred to as enclave tourism and tourism apartheid Contacts between foreign visitors and ordinary Cubans were de facto illegal between 1992 and 1997 The rapid growth of tourism during the Special Period had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba and led to speculation about the emergence of a twotier economy Cuba has tripled its market share of Caribbean tourism in the last decade as a result of significant investment in tourism infrastructure this growth rate is predicted to continue 19 million tourists visited Cuba in 2003 predominantly from Canada and the European Union generating revenue of US21 billion Cuba recorded 2688000 international tourists in 2011 the thirdhighest figure in the Caribbean behind the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico The medical tourism sector caters to thousands of European Latin American Canadian and American consumers every year Allegations of widespread sex tourism are downplayed by the Cuban Justice minister According to a Government of Canada travel advice website Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism and a number of tourists including Canadians have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years Geography Main article Geography of Cuba Cuba is an archipelago of islands located in the northern Caribbean Sea at the confluence with the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean It lies between latitudes 19° and 24°N and longitudes 74° and 85°W The United States lies 150 kilometers 93 miles across the Straits of Florida to the north and northwest to the closest tip of Key West Florida and the Bahamas 21 km 13 mi to the north Mexico lies 210 kilometers 130 miles across the Yucatán Channel to the west to the closest tip of Cabo Catoche in the State of Quintana Roo Haiti is 77 km 48 mi to the east Jamaica 140 km87 mi and the Cayman Islands to the south Cuba is the principal island surrounded by four smaller groups of islands the Colorados Archipelago on the northwestern coast the SabanaCamagüey Archipelago on the northcentral Atlantic coast the Jardines de la Reina on the southcentral coast and the Canarreos Archipelago on the southwestern coast The main island named Cuba is 1250 km 780 mi long constituting most of the nations land area 104556 km 40369 sq mi and is the largest island in the Caribbean and 17thlargest island in the world by land area The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the Sierra Maestra mountains in the southeast whose highest point is Pico Turquino 1974 m 6476 ft The secondlargest island is Isla de la Juventud Isle of Youth in the Canarreos archipelago with an area of 2200 km 849 sq mi Cuba has an official area land area of 109884 km 42426 sq mi Its area is 110860 km 42803 sq mi including coastal and territorial waters Climate Main article Climate of Cuba With the entire island south of the Tropic of Cancer the local climate is tropical moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow yearround The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current which brings in warm water from the equator This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of Hong Kong which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate In general with local variations there is a drier season from November to April and a rainier season from May to October The average temperature is 21 °C 698 °F in January and 27 °C 806 °F in July The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes These are most common in September and October Biodiversity Cuba signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on June 12 1992 and became a party to the convention on March 8 1994 It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan with one revision which was received by the convention on January 24 2008 The revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery There is however virtually no information in that document about biodiversity itself The countrys fourth national report to the CBD however contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba the main groups being animals 17801 species bacteria 270 species chromista 707 species fungi including lichenforming species 5844 species plants 9107 species and protozoa 1440 species As elsewhere in the world vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented The numbers recorded from Cuba for those groups are therefore likely to be close to the numbers which actually occur in Cuba For most if not all of the other groups however the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed often considerably the numbers of those recorded so far Demographics Main articles Cuban people and Demographics of Cuba According to the official census of 2010 Cubas population was 11241161 comprising 5628996 men and 5612165 women Its birth rate 988 births per thousand population in 2006 is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere Although the country has grown by around 4 million people since 1961 the rate of increase had simultaneously began to fall during that period and the population began to decline in 2006 with a fertility rate of 143 children per woman Indeed this drop in fertility is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion Cubas abortion rate was 586 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996 compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean 27 in Latin America overall and 48 in Europe Similarly the use of contraceptives is also widespread estimated at 79 of the female population in the upper third of countries in the Western Hemisphere Ethnoracial groups Cubas population is multiethnic reflecting its complex colonial origins Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the countrys racial composition whereas the Institute for Cuban and CubanAmerican Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62 of Cubans are black the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population 6505 was white In fact the Minority Rights Group International determined that An objective assessment of the situation of AfroCubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre and postrevolution Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously ranging from 34 to 62 A study from 2014 found the autosomal genetic ancestry in Cuba to be 72 European 20 African and 8 Native American 35 of maternal lineages derived from Cuban Native Americans compared to 39 from Africa and 26 from Europe but male lineages were European 82 and African 18 indicating the historical bias towards mating between foreign men and native women rather than the inverse Ancestral contributions in Cubans as inferred from autosomal AIMs Ancestral contributions in Cubans as inferred from Ychromosome markers Ancestral contributions in Cubans as inferred from mtDNA markers Asians make up about 1 of the population and are largely of Chinese ancestry followed by Filipinos Japanese and Vietnamese Many are descendants of farm laborers brought to the island by Spanish and American contractors during the 19th and early 20th century The currently recorded number of Cubans with Chinese ancestry is 114240 AfroCubans are descended primarily from the Yoruba people as well as several thousand North African refugees most notably the Sahrawi Arabs of Western Sahara Immigration and emigration Main article Spanish immigration to Cuba Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cubas demographic profile Between the 18th and early 20th century large waves of Canarian Catalan Andalusian Galician and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba Between 1899–1930 alone close to a million Spaniards entered the country though many would eventually return to Spain Other prominent immigrant groups included French Portuguese Italian Russian Dutch Greek British and Irish as well as small number of descendants of US citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Postrevolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration which has led to a large and influential diaspora community During the three decades after January 1959 more than one million Cubans of all social classes — constituting 10 of the total population — emigrated to the United States a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the US from the Caribbean as a whole during that period Other common destinations include Spain the United Kingdom Canada Mexico and Sweden among others Those who left the country typically did so by sea in small boats and fragile rafts On September 9 1994 the US and Cuban governments agreed that the US would grant at least 20000 visas annually in exchange for Cubas pledge to prevent further unlawful departures on boats Religion Main article Religion in Cuba In 2010 the religious affiliation of the country was estimated by the Pew Forum to be 65 Christian 60 Roman Catholic or about 69 million in 2016 5 Protestant or about 575000 in 2016 23 unaffiliated 17

constitution in 1992 to drop the states characterization as atheistic Roman Catholicism is the largest religion with its origins in Spanish colonization Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics in 2006 it nonetheless remains the dominant faith Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 1998 and 2011 respectively and Pope Francis visited Cuba in September 2015 Prior to each papal visit the Cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture The governments relaxation of restrictions on house churches in the 1990s led to an explosion of Pentecostalism with some groups claiming as many as 100000 members However Evangelical Protestant sects organized into the umbrella Cuban Council of Churches remain much more powerful The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by syncretisms of various kinds Christianity is often practiced in tandem with Santería a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths which include a number of cults La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre the Virgin of Cobre is the Catholic patroness of Cuba and a symbol of Cuban culture In Santería she has been syncretized with the goddess Oshun Cuba also hosts small communities of Jews 500 in 2012 Muslims and members of the Baháí Faith Several wellknown Cuban religious figures have operated outside the island including the humanitarian and author Jorge Armando Pérez Languages The official language of Cuba is Spanish and the vast majority of Cubans speak it Spanish as spoken in Cuba is known as Cuban Spanish and is a form of Caribbean Spanish

Cuba has universal health care and although shortages of medical supplies persist there is no shortage of medical personnel Primary care is available throughout the island and infant and maternal mortality rates compare favorably with those in developed nations PostRevolution Cuba initially experienced an overall worsening in terms of disease and infant mortality rates in the 1960s when half its 6000 doctors left the country Recovery occurred by the 1980s and the countrys healthcare has been widely praised The Communist government asserted that universal health care was to become a
