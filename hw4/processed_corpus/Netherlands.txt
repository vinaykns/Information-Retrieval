the region of Holland or the Low Countries de Nederlanden The Netherlands ˈnɛðərləndz Dutch Nederland ˈneːdərˌlɑnt  listen Frisian Nederlân is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east Belgium to the south and the North Sea to the northwest sharing maritime borders with Belgium the United Kingdom and Germany The three largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam Rotterdam and The Hague Amsterdam is the countrys capital while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of parliament and government The port of Rotterdam is the worlds largest port outside EastAsia and by far the largest port in Europe The name Holland is used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands Netherlands literally means lower countries influenced by its low land and flat geography with only about 50 of its land exceeding one metre above sea level Most of the areas below sea level are manmade Since the late 16th century large areas polders have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes amounting to nearly 17 of the countrys current land mass With a population density of 412 people per km – 507 January 2017 if water is excluded – the Netherlands is classified as a very densely populated country Only Bangladesh South Korea and Taiwan have both a larger population and higher population density Nevertheless the Netherlands is the worlds secondlargest exporter of food and agricultural products after the United States This is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate The Netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy organised as a unitary state The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country having legalised abortion prostitution and euthanasia while maintaining a progressive drugs policy In 2001 it became the worlds first country to legalise samesex marriage The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU Eurozone G10 NATO OECD and WTO as well as being a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts the Permanent Court of Arbitration the International Court of Justice the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon The first four are situated in The Hague as is the EUs criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial cooperation agency Eurojust This has led to the city being dubbed the worlds legal capital The country also ranks second highest in the worlds 2016 Press Freedom Index as published by Reporters Without Borders The Netherlands has a marketbased mixed economy ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom It had the thirteenthhighest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund In 2013 the United Nations World Happiness Report ranked the Netherlands as the seventhhappiest country in the world reflecting its high quality of life The Netherlands also ranks second highest in the Inequalityadjusted Human Development Index Etymology See also Netherlands terminology The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation Holland meaning holt land or wood land though this refers only to North and South Holland two of the nations twelve provinces formerly a single province and earlier the County of Holland This originally Frankish county emerged from the dissolved Frisian Kingdom and was – after the decline of Duchy of Brabant and County of Flanders – economically and politically the most important county in the Low Countries region Because of this importance and the emphasis on Holland during the formation of the Dutch Republic the Eighty Years War and later the AngloDutch Wars in the 16th 17th and 18th century Holland served as a pars pro toto for the entire country and is nowadays considered either incorrect informal or on occasion opprobrious depending on the context but is widely used when referring to the national football team The region called Low Countries comprising Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg and the country of the Netherlands have the same toponymy Place names with Neder or lage Nieder Nether or low and Nedre in Germanic languages and Bas or Inferior in Romance languages are in use in places all over Europe They are sometimes used in a deictic relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as Upper Boven Oben Superior or Haut In the case of the Low Countries the Netherlands the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea The geographical location of the upper region however changed over time tremendously The Romans made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream Germania Inferior nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands and upstream Germania Superior nowadays part of Germany The designation Low to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of Lower Lorraine that covered much of the Low Countries But this time the corresponding Upper region is Upper Lorraine in nowadays Northern France The Dukes of Burgundy who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century used the term les pays de par deçà the lands over here for the Low Countries as opposed to les pays de par delà the lands over there for their original homeland Burgundy in presentday eastcentral France Under Habsburg rule Les pays de par deçà developed in pays dembas lands downhere a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions in Europe This was translated as Nederlanden in contemporary Dutch official documents From a regional point of view Niderlant was also the area between the Meuse and the lower Rhine in the late Middle Ages The area known as Oberland High country was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located Cologne From the midsixteenth century on the Low Countries and the Netherlands lost their original deictic meaning and were – besides Flanders – probably the most commonly used names The Eighty Years War 1568–1648 divided the Low Countries into an independent northern Dutch Republic or Latinised Belgica Foederata Federated Netherlands the precursor state of the Netherlands and a Spanish controlled Southern Netherlands Latinised Belgica Regia Royal Netherlands the precursor state of Belgium The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries the Netherlands Belgium and Luxembourg although in most Romance languages the term Low Countries is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term Benelux History Main article History of the Netherlands Prehistory before 500 BC The prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the lowlying geography The oldest human Neanderthal traces in the Netherlands were found in higher soils near Maastricht from what is believed to be about 250000 years ago After the end of the Ice Age various Paleolithic groups inhabited the area and around 8000 BC Mesolithic tribes resided in Friesland and Drenthe where the oldest canoe in the world was recovered Autochthonous huntergatherers from the Swifterbant culture are attested from around 5600 BC onwards They are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern Scandinavian Ertebølle culture 5300–4000 BC To the west the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game People made the switch to animal husbandry sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC Agricultural transformation took place very gradually between 4300 BC and 4000 BC The farming Funnelbeaker culture extended from Denmark through northern Germany into the northern Netherlands and erected the dolmens large stone grave monuments found in Drenthe built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC To the southwest the Vlaardingen culture around 2600 BC an apparently more primitive culture of huntergatherers survived well into the Neolithic period Around 2950 BC there was a quick and smooth transition from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the panEuropean Corded Ware pastoralist culture The Bell Beaker culture also present in the Netherlands apparently rose out of the Corded Ware culture Discoveries of copper artifacts imply trade with other parts of Europe as the metal is not normally found in Dutch soil The Bronze Age probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects suggest that it was a trading centre in the Bronze Age The Bell Beaker cultures 2700–2100 BC locally developed into the Bronze Age BarbedWire Beaker culture 2100–1800 BC In the second millennium BC the region was the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons roughly divided by the course of the Rhine In the north the Elp culture c 1800 BC to 800 BC was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker The initial phase was characterised by tumuli 1800–1200 BC that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia and were apparently related to the Tumulus culture 1600–1200 BC in central Europe This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring Urnfield cremation burial customs 1200–800 BC The southern region became dominated by the Hilversum culture 1800–800 BC which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous BarbedWire Beaker culture The Iron Age brought a measure of prosperity Iron ore was available throughout the country including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north the natural ironbearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant Smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron fabricating tools on demand including axes knives pins arrowheads and swords Some evidence even suggests the making of Damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel The Kings grave of Oss dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral Germanic groups and Romans 500 BC – 410 AD Main articles Celts Germanic peoples and Romans in the Netherlands The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC that further deteriorated around 650 BC might have triggered migration of Germanic tribes from the North By the time this migration was complete around 250 BC a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged The North Sea Germanic Ingvaeones inhabited the northern part of the Low Countries They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons A second grouping the WeserRhine Germanic or Istvaeones extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the Salian Franks Also the Celtic La Tène culture c 450 BC up to the Roman conquest had expanded over a wide range including the southern area of the Low Countries Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language neither Germanic nor Celtic survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period the Iron Age Nordwestblock culture that eventually was being absorbed by the Celts to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east During the Gallic Wars the area south of the Oude Rijn and west of the Rhine was conquered by Roman forces under Julius Caesar from 57 BC to 53 BC Caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands the Menapii and the Eburones The Rhine became fixed as Romes northern frontier around 12 AD Notable towns would arise along the Limes Germanicus Nijmegen and Voorburg At first part of Gallia Belgica the area south of the Limes became part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior The area to the north of the Rhine inhabited by the Frisii remained outside Roman rule but not its presence and control while the border tribes Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry The Batavi rose against the Romans in the Batavian rebellion of 69AD but were eventually defeated The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies The Salian Franks were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century From their new base in West Flanders and the Southwest Netherlands they were raiding the English Channel Roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the Franks who continued to be feared at least until the time of Julian the Apostate 358 when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as foederati in Toxandria After deteriorating climate conditions and the Romans withdrawal the Frisii disappeared from the northern Netherlands probably forced to resettle within Roman territory as laeti in c 296 Coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries Early Middle Ages 411–1000 Main articles Frankish Kingdom and Frisian Kingdom After Roman government in the area collapsed the Franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms By the 490s Clovis I had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one Frankish kingdom and from there continued his conquests into Gaul During this expansion Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north ie southern Netherlands and Flanders who kept on speaking Old Frankish which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch A DutchFrench language boundary came into existence To the north of the Franks climatic conditions on the coast improved and during the Migration Period the abandoned land was resettled again mostly by Saxons but also by the closely related Angles Jutes and ancient Frisii Many moved on to England and came to be known as AngloSaxons but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians and their language as Frisian named after the land that was once inhabited by Frisii Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast and it is still the language most closely related to English among the living languages of continental Europe By the seventh century a Frisian Kingdom 650–734 under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Utrecht as its centre of power while Dorestad was a flourishing trading place Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks In 734 at the Battle of the Boarn the Frisians were defeated after a series of wars With the approval of the Franks the AngloSaxon missionary Willibrord converted the Frisian people to Christianity He established the Archdiocese of Utrecht and became bishop of the Frisians However his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum in 754 The Frankish Carolingian empire modeled itself after the Roman Empire and controlled much of Western Europe However as of 843 it was divided into three parts—East Middle and West Francia Most of presentday Netherlands became part of Middle Francia which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours It comprises territories from Frisia in the north to the Kingdom of Italy in the south When the middle kingdom was partitioned the lands north of the Alps passed to Lothair II and consecutively were named Lotharingia After he died in 869 Lotharingia was partitioned into Upper and Lower Lotharingia the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of East Francia in 870 although it was effectively under the control of Vikings who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers Around 850 Lothair I acknowledged the Viking Rorik of Dorestad as ruler of most of Frisia Around 879 another Viking raided the Frisian lands Godfrid Duke of Frisia The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak Resistance to the Vikings if any came from local nobles who gained in stature as a result and that lay the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semiindependent states One of these local nobles was Gerolf of Holland who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid and Viking rule came to an end High Middle Ages 1000–1384 Main article History of urban centers in the Low Countries The Holy Roman Empire the successor state of East Francia ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity Powerful local nobles turned their cities counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor Holland Hainaut Flanders Gelre Brabant and the Utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant the area quickly became Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch The rest of Frisia in the north now Friesland and Groningen continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions collectively called the Frisian freedom and resented the imposition of the feudal system Around 1000 AD due to several agricultural developments the economy started to develop at a fast pace and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen Towns grew around monasteries and castles and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas especially in Flanders and later also Brabant Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign In practice this meant that Brugge and Antwerp became quasiindependent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe Around 1100 AD farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands and made the emergence of the County of Holland as center of power possible The title of Count of Holland were fought over in the Hook and Cod Wars Dutch Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten between 1350 and 1490 The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen These noblemen invited the Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy – who was also Count of Flanders – to conquer Holland Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands 1384–1581 Main articles Burgundian Netherlands and Habsburg Netherlands Most of the Imperial and French fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a personal union by Philip the Good duke of Burgundy in 1433 The House of ValoisBurgundy and their Habsburg heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581 Before the Burgundian union the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests which then developed rapidly The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium Northern France and England This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained Under Habsburg Charles V ruler of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the Seventeen Provinces which also included most of presentday Belgium Luxembourg and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany In 1568 the Eighty Years War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began In 1579 the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the Union of Utrecht in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands In 1581 the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II of Spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces The Protestant Queen Elizabeth I of England sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish and sent an army of 7600 soldiers to aid the Dutch in their war with the Catholic Spanish The English army under command of Robert Dudley 1st Earl of Leicester was of no real benefit to the Dutch rebellion Philip II the son of Charles V was not prepared to let them go easily and war continued until 1648 when Spain under King Philip IV finally recognised the independence of the seven northwestern provinces in the Peace of Münster Parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republicanmercantile empire Dutch Republic 1581–1795 Main articles Dutch Republic and Evolution of the Dutch Empire After declaring their independence the provinces of Holland Zeeland Groningen Friesland Utrecht Overijssel and Gelderland formed a confederation All these duchies lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government the StatesProvincial The States General the confederal government were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic too although it was not considered one of the provinces Moreover the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years War a number of socalled Generality Lands in Flanders Brabant and Limburg Their population was mainly Roman Catholic and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanishcontrolled Southern Netherlands In the Dutch Golden Age spanning much of the 17th century the Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers Science military and art especially painting were among the most acclaimed in the world By 1650 the Dutch owned 16000 merchant ships The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company established colonies and trading posts all over the world including ruling the northern parts of Taiwan between 1624–1662 and 1664–1667 The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614 In South Africa the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652 Dutch colonies in South America were established along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains among them Colony of Surinam now Suriname In Asia the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies now Indonesia and the only western trading post in Japan Dejima Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world In early modern Europe it had the wealthiest trading city Amsterdam and the first fulltime stock exchange The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boombust cycle the worlds first assetinflation bubble the tulip mania of 1636–1637 and the worlds first bear raider Isaac le Maire who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount In 1672 – known in Dutch history as the Rampjaar Disaster Year – the Dutch Republic was in war with France England and three German Bishoprics simultaneously At sea it could successfully prevent the English and French navy entering the western shores On land however it was almost taken over interlay by the advancing French and German armies coming from the east It could however turn the tide by inundating parts of Holland but could never recover to its former glory again and went into a state of general decline in the 18th century with economic competition from England and longstanding rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society the republican Staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the Prinsgezinden as main political factions Batavian Republic and kingdom 1795–1890 Main articles Batavian Republic Kingdom of Holland United Kingdom of the Netherlands and Kingdom of the Netherlands With the armed support of revolutionary France Dutch republicans proclaimed the Batavian Republic modelled after the French Republic and rendering the Netherlands a unitary state on 19 January 1795 The stadtholder William V of Orange had fled to England But from 1806 to 1810 the Kingdom of Holland was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother Louis Bonaparte to control the Netherlands more effectively However King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brothers and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810 The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813 when Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Leipzig William Frederick son of the last stadtholder returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands Two years later the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France William Frederick raised this United Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself King William I In addition William became hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg in exchange for his German possessions However the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581 and rebelled The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium while the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890 when William III died with no surviving male heirs Ascendancy laws prevented his daughter Queen Wilhelmina from becoming the next Grand Duchess The Belgian Revolution at home and the Java War in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy However the Cultivation System was introduced in 1830 in the Dutch East Indies 20 of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony selfsufficient On the other hand the colonies in the West Indies Dutch Guiana and Curaçao and Dependencies relied heavily on African slaves in which the Dutch part is estimated at 5–7 percent or more than half a million Africans The Netherlands abolished slavery in 1863 Furthermore slaves in Suriname would be fully free only in 1873 since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10year transition The Dutch were also one of the last European countries to industrialise in the second half of the 19th century World wars and beyond 1890–present Main articles History of the Netherlands 1900–present The Netherlands in World War I and Netherlands in World War II The Netherlands were able to remain neutral during World War I in part because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival until the blockade by the British Royal Navy in 1916 That changed in World War II when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 The Rotterdam Blitz forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender four days later During the occupation over 100000 Dutch Jews were rounded up and transported to Nazi extermination camps of whom only a few survived Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers and the countryside was plundered for food Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans over 20000 Dutch fascists joined the Waffen SS fighting on the Eastern Front Political collaborators were members of the fascist NSB the only legal political party in the occupied Netherlands On 8 December 1941 the Dutch governmentinexile in London declared war on Japan but could not prevent the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies Indonesia In 1944–45 the First Canadian Army which included Canadian British and Polish troops was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands But soon after VE day the Dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of Indonesia In 1954 the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands reformed the political structure of the Netherlands which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation The Dutch colonies of Surinam and Curaçao and Dependencies and the European country all became countries within the Kingdom on a basis of equality Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945 recognised in 1949 and thus was never part of the reformed Kingdom Suriname followed in 1975 After the war the Netherlands left behind also an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the Benelux the NATO Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community which would evolve into the EEC Common Market and later the European Union Governmentencouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500000 Dutch people to leave the country after the war The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change such as rapid ontzuiling literally depillarisation a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines Youths and students in particular rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as womens rights sexuality disarmament and environmental issues On 10 October 2010 the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved Referendums were held on each island to determine their future status As a result the islands of Bonaire Sint Eustatius and Saba the BES islands were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands Geography Main article Geography of the Netherlands The European area of the Netherlands lies between latitudes 50° and 54° N and longitudes 3° and 8° E The Netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country with about 26 of its area and 21 of its population located below sea level and only about 50 of its land exceeding one metre above sea level The country is for the most part flat with the exception of foothills in the far southeast up to a height of no more than 321 metres and some low hill ranges in the central parts Most of the areas below sea level are manmade caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation Since the late 16th century large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes canals and pumping stations Nearly 17 of the countrys land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes Much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large European rivers the Rhine Rijn the Meuse Maas and the Scheldt Schelde as well as their tributaries The southwestern part of the Netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers the RhineMeuseScheldt delta The Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine the Waal its main tributary branch and the Meuse In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their Great Rivers de Grote Rivieren Another significant branch of the Rhine the IJssel river discharges into Lake IJssel the former Zuiderzee southern sea Just like the previous this river forms a linguistic divide people to the northeast of this river speak Dutch Low Saxon dialects except for the province of Friesland which has its own language Floods Main articles Flood control in the Netherlands Floods in the Netherlands North Sea flood of 1953 and Storm tides of the North Sea Over the centuries the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention Most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134 which created the archipelago of Zeeland in the southwest On 14 December 1287 St Lucias flood affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history The St Elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder replacing it with the 72squarekilometre 28 sq mi Biesbosch tidal floodplains in the southcentre The huge North Sea flood of early February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest of the Netherlands more than 1800 people drowned in the flood The Dutch government subsequently instituted a largescale programme the Delta Works to protect the country against future flooding which was completed over a period of more than thirty years The impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity Relatively highlying swampland was drained to be used as farmland The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level causing the underlying peat to contract further Additionally until the 19th century peat was mined dried and used for fuel further exacerbating the problem Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres Even in flooded areas peat extraction continued through turf dredging Because of the flooding farming was difficult which encouraged foreign trade the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th15th century To guard against floods a series of defences against the water were contrived In the first millennium AD villages and farmhouses were built on manmade hills called terps Later these terps were connected by dikes In the 12th century local government agencies called waterschappen water boards or hoogheemraadschappen high home councils started to appear whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods these agencies continue to exist As the ground level dropped the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level The windmills were later used to drain lakes creating the famous polders In 1932 the Afsluitdijk Closure Dike was completed blocking the former Zuiderzee Southern Sea from the North Sea and thus creating the IJsselmeer IJssel Lake It became part of the larger Zuiderzee Works in which four polders totalling 2500 square kilometres 965 sq mi were reclaimed from the sea The Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change Not only is the rising sea a problem but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow Delta works Main article Delta Works After the 1953 disaster the Delta Works were constructed a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering New projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the Delta Works A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10000 years compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country This was achieved by raising 3000 kilometres 1864 mi of outer seadykes and 10000 kilometres 6214 mi of inner canal and river dikes and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world It is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise see Flood control in the Netherlands A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of 110 metres 36 ft and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 centimetres 39 in The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like dikes and dunes with 130 metres 43 ft of additional flood protection Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side but could also alter rain fall patterns and river runoff To protect the country from river flooding another program is already being executed The Room for the River plan grants more flow space to rivers protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands The few residents who lived in these socalled overflow areas have been moved to higher ground with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels Climate The predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is southwest which causes a moderate maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters and typically high humidity This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline where the difference in temperature between summer and winter as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country The following tables are based on mean measurements by the KNMI weather station in De Bilt between 1981 and 2010 Ice days maximum temperature below 0 °C 32 °F usually occur from December until February with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period Freezing days minimum temperature below 0 °C 32 °F occur much more often usually ranging from midNovember to late March but not rarely measured as early as midOctober and as late as midMay If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10 cm 4 in above ground instead of 150 cm 59 in one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer On average snow can occur from November to April but sometimes occurs in May or October too Warm days maximum temperature above 20 °C 68 °F in De Bilt are usually found in April to October but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March or even sometimes in November or February usually not in De Bilt however Summer days maximum temperature above 25 °C 77 °F are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September tropical days maximum temperature above 30 °C 86 °F are rare and usually occur only in June to August Precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days this is especially the case in summer when lightning is also much more frequent The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June Nature Further information List of national parks of the Netherlands and List of extinct animals of the

other forms of Protestantism such as Baptists and Lutherans and Judaism were tolerated but discriminated against In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs prostitution LGBT rights euthanasia and abortion which are among the most liberal in the world Political parties Main articles Political parties of the Netherlands and Politics of the Netherlands Because of the multiparty system no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century and coalition cabinets had to be formed Since suffrage became universal in 1919 the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties the strongest of which were the Christian democrats currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal CDA second were the social democrats represented by the Labour Party PvdA and third were the liberals of which the right wing Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy VVD is the main representative These parties cooperated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian democrats had always been a partner so either a centreleft coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centreright coalition of Christian democrats and liberals In the 1970s the party system became more volatile the Christian democratic parties lost seats while new parties became successful such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66 In the 1994 election the CDA lost its dominant position A purple cabinet was formed by VVD D66 and PvdA In the 2002 elections this cabinet lost its majority because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right LPF a new political party around Pim Fortuyn who was assassinated a week before the elections A shortlived cabinet was formed by CDA VVD and LPF which was led by the CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende After the 2003 elections in which the LPF lost most of its seats a cabinet was formed by CDA VVD and D66 The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state the healthcare system and immigration policy In June 2006 the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the Minister of Immigration and Integration Rita Verdonk who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of Ayaan Hirsi Ali a VVD MP A caretaker cabinet was formed by CDA and VVD and general elections were held on 22 November 2006 In these elections the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains The formation of a new cabinet took three months resulting in a coalition of CDA PvdA and ChristianUnion On 20 February 2010 the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan Afghanistan Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010 with devastating results for the previously largest party the CDA which lost about half of its seats resulting in 21 seats The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats The big winner of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders whose right wing PVV the ideological successor to the LPF more than doubled its number of seats Negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government led by VVD a first in coalition with CDA which was sworn in on 14 October 2010 This unprecedented minority government was supported by PVV but proved ultimately to be unstable when on 21 April 2012 Wilders leader of PVV unexpectedly torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks on new austerity measures paving the way for early elections VVD and PvdA were the big winners of the elections Since 5 November 2012 they have formed the second Rutte cabinet Government Main article Government of the Netherlands Administrative

other sectors of the economy leading to the theory of Dutch disease Apart from coal and gas the country has no mining resources The last coal mine was closed in 1974 The Groningen gas field one of the largest natural gas fields in the world is situated near Slochteren Exploitation of this field has resulted in €159 billion in revenue since the mid1970s The field is operated by governmentowned

Australia Canada Germany and New Zealand Ever since a major reform of the health care system in 2006 the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year According to the HCP Health Consumer Powerhouse the Netherlands has a chaos system meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance to where they get their healthcare service But the difference

over the age of 18 years regardless of age or state of health – its illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions In contrast to many other European systems the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands but not in charge of its management Healthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways three echelons in somatic and mental health care and in cure short term and care long term Home doctors huisartsen comparable to General Practitioners form the largest part of the first echelon Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most costeffective Healthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006 Longterm treatments especially those that involve semipermanent hospitalization and also disability costs such as wheelchairs are covered by a statecontrolled mandatory insurance This is laid down in the Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs which first came into effect in 1968 In 2009 this insurance covered 27 of all health care expenses For all regular shortterm medical treatment there is a system of obligatory health insurance with

sources of health care payment are taxes 14 out of pocket payments 9 additional optional health insurance packages 4 and a range of other sources 4 Affordability is guaranteed through a system of incomerelated allowances and individual and employerpaid incomerelated premiums A key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through risk equalization and a common risk pool Funding for all shortterm health care is 50 from employers 45 from the insured person and 5 by the government Children under 18 are covered for free Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance Premiums paid by the insured are about 100 € per month about US127 in Aug 2010 and in 2012 €150 or US196 with variation of about 5 between the various competing insurers and deductible a year €220 US288

Cuisine Main article Dutch cuisine Originally the countrys cuisine was shaped by the practices of fishing and farming including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward and contains many dairy products Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings with cereal for breakfast as an alternative Traditionally dinner consists of potatoes a portion of meat and seasonal vegetables The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country Without many refinements it is best described as rustic though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities Modern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands roughly the provinces of Groningen Friesland Drenthe Overijssel and Gelderland north of the great rivers are the least populated area of the Netherlands The late 18th century introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the IJsselmeer also include a large amount of fish The various dried sausages belonging to the metworstfamily of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste Also smoked sausages are common of which Gelderse rookworst is the most renowned The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy Larger sausages are often eaten alongside stamppot hutspot or zuurkool sauerkraut whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a street food The provinces are also home to hard textured rye bread pastries and cookies the latter heavily spiced with ginger or succade or contain small bits of meat Various kinds of Kruidkoek such as Groninger koek Fryske dúmkes and spekdikken small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron are considered typical Notable characteristics of Fries roggebrood Frisian rye bread is its long baking time up to 20 hours resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour In terms of alcoholic beverages the region is renowned for its many bitters such as Beerenburg and other highproof liquors rather than beer which is apart from Jenever typical for the rest of the country As a coastal region Friesland is home to lowlying grasslands and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine Friese Nagelkaas Friesian Clove is a notable example The provinces of North Holland South Holland Zeeland Utrecht and the Gelderlandic region of Betuwe are the parts of the Netherlands which make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found Because of the abundance of water and flat grass lands that are found here the area is known for its many dairy products which includes prominent cheeses such as Gouda Leyden spiced cheese with cumin Edam traditionally in small spheres as well as Leerdammer and Beemster while the adjacent Zaanstreek in North Holland is since the 16th century known for its mayonnaise typical wholegrain mustards and chocolate industry Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter which contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other European butter varieties A byproduct of the buttermaking process karnemelk buttermilk is also considered typical for this region Seafood such as soused herring mussels called Zeeuwse Mossels since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeelands Oosterschelde eels oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region Kibbeling once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish has become a national fast food just as lekkerbek Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy and often contain large amounts of sugar either caramelised powdered or crystallised The oliebol in its modern form and Zeeuwse bolus are good examples Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar like stroopwafel as well as a filling of some kind mostly almond like gevulde koek The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer strong pale lager and Jenever a high proof juniperflavored spirit that came to be known in England as gin A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape Advocaat a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs sugar and brandy is also native to this region The Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium It is renowned for its many rich pastries soups stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages renowned for its splendor and great feasts It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine Pastries are abundant often with rich fillings of cream custard or fruits Cakes such as the Vlaai from Limburg and the Moorkop and Bossche Bol from Brabant are typical pastries Savoury pastries also occur with the worstenbroodje a roll with a sausage of ground beef literally translates into sausage bread being the most popular The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer There are many local brands ranging from Trappist to Kriek 5 of the 10 International Trappist Association recognised breweries in the world are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area Beer like wine in French cuisine is also used in cooking often in stews In early 2014 Oxfam ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious plentiful and healthy food in a comparison of 125 countries Colonial heritage Main article Dutch Empire Further information Dutch East Indies and Indos in the Dutch East Indies From the exploitations of the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century to the colonisations in the 19th century Dutch imperial possessions continued to expand reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century The Dutch East Indies which later formed modernday Indonesia was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands In the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century the Netherlands urbanised considerably mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies Social status was based on merchants income which reduced feudalism and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society When the Dutch Royal Family was established in 1815 much of its wealth came from Colonial trade Universities such as the Royal Leiden University founded in the 16th century have developed into leading knowledge centres for Southeast Asian and Indonesian studies Leiden University has produced leading academics such as Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures Leiden University and in particular KITLV are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam Tropenmuseum an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art culture ethnography and anthropology The traditions of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army KNIL are maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz of the modern Royal Netherlands Army A dedicated Bronbeek Museum a former home for retired KNIL soldiers exists in Arnhem to this day A specific segment of Dutch literature called Dutch Indies literature still exists and includes established authors such as Louis Couperus the writer of The Hidden Force taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration One of the great masterpieces of Dutch literature is the book Max Havelaar written by Multatuli in 1860 The majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are Indo Eurasian native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community In Dutch they are referred to as Indische Nederlanders or as Indo short for IndoEuropean Including their second generation descendants Indos are currently the largest foreignborn group in the Netherlands In 2008 the Dutch Census Bureau for Statistics CBS registered 387000 first and secondgeneration Indos living in the Netherlands Although considered fully assimilated into Dutch society as the main ethnic minority in the Netherlands these repatriants have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of Indonesian culture into Dutch mainstream culture Practically every town in the Netherlands has a Toko Dutch Indonesian Shop or an Indonesian restaurant and many Pasar Malam Night market in MalayIndonesian fairs are organised throughout the year Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands Rijsttafel a colonial culinary concept and dishes such as Nasi goreng and satay are very popular in
