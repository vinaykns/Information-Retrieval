 Main article Decoupling plus In public utility regulation decoupling refers to the disassociation of a utilitys profits from its sales of the energy commodity Instead a rate of return is aligned with meeting revenue targets and rates are adjusted up or down to meet the target at the end of the adjustment period This makes the utility indifferent to selling less product and improves the ability of energy efficiency and distributed generation to operate within the utility environment Ideally utilities should be rewarded based on how well they meet their customers energy service needs However most current rate designs place the focus on commodity sales instead tying a distribution companys recovery of fixed costs directly to its commodity sales In order to motivate utilities to consider all the options when planning and making resource decisions on how to meet their customers needs the salesrevenue link in current rate design must be broken Breaking that link between the utilitys commodity sales and revenues removes both the incentive to increase electricity sales and the disincentive to run effective energy efficiency programs or invest in other activities that may reduce load Decisionmaking then refocuses on making leastcost investments to deliver reliable energy services to customers even when such investments reduce throughput The result is a better alignment of shareholder and customer interests to provide for more economically and environmentally efficient resource decisions As an added benefit breaking the salesrevenue link streamlines the regulatory process for rate adjustments Contention over sales forecasts consumes extensive time in every rate case If the salesrevenue link is broken these forecasts carry no economic weight so the incentive to game forecasts of electricity sales is removed and rate cases become less adversarial For an indepth discussion on decoupling see Revenue Regulation and Decoupling Lazar et al The Regulatory Assistance Project 2011 While many environmentalists and conservation advocates support decoupling many consumer advocates representing utility ratepayers have opposed decoupling as it attempts to guarantee revenue levels to utility companies Decoupling mechanisms reduce a utility companys financial risk from reducing sales due to conservation weather and economic conditions As a result many consumer advocates have requested and state and federal regulators have required that utility companies profit levels measured through a return on equity allowance be reduced to reflect lower risk References
