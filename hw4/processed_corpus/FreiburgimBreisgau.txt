independence 1805 Became part of Baden 19401944 Heavily damaged during WWII Freiburg was founded by Konrad and Duke Berthold III of Zähringen in 1120 as a free market town hence its name which translates to free or independent town Frei means free and Burg like the modern English word borough was used in those days for an incorporated city or town usually one with some degree of autonomy The German word Burg also means a fortified town as in Hamburg Thus it is likely that the name of this place means a fortified town of free citizens This town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea regions and the Rhine and Danube rivers In 1200 Freiburgs population numbered approximately 6000 people At about that time under the rule of Bertold V the last duke of Zähringen the city began construction of its Freiburg Münster cathedral on the site of an older parish church Begun in the Romanesque style it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a Gothic edifice In 1218 when Bertold V died then Egino V von Urach the count of Urach assumed the title of Freiburgs count as Egino I von Freiburg The city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document At the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of Freiburg and their lord Count Egino II of Freiburg Egino II raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens freedom after which the Freiburgers used catapults to destroy the counts castle atop the Schloßberg a hill that overlooks the city center The furious count called on his brotherinlaw the Bishop of Strasbourg Konradius von Lichtenberg for help The bishop responded by marching with his army to Freiburg According to an old Freiburg legend a butcher named Hauri stabbed the Bishop of Strasbourg to death on 29 July 1299 It was a Pyrrhic victory since henceforth the citizens of Freiburg had to pay an annual expiation of 300 marks in silver to the count of Freiburg until 1368 In 1366 the counts of Freiburg made another failed attempt to occupy the city during a night raid Eventually the citizens were fed up with their lords and in 1368 Freiburg purchased its independence from them The city turned itself over to the protection of the Habsburgs who allowed the city to retain a large measure of freedom Most of the nobles of the city died in the battle of Sempach 1386 The patrician family Schnewlin took control of the city until the guildsmen revolted The guilds became more powerful than the patricians by 1389 The silver mines in Mount Schauinsland provided an important source of capital for Freiburg This silver made Freiburg one of the richest cities in Europe and in 1327 Freiburg minted its own coin the Rappenpfennig In 1377 the cities of Freiburg Basel Colmar and Breisach entered into an alliance known as the Genossenschaft des Rappenpfennigs Rappenpfennig Collective This alliance facilitated commerce among the cities and lasted until the end of the sixteenth century There were 80009000 people living in Freiburg between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and 30 churches and monasteries At the end of the fourteenth century the veins of silver were dwindling and by 1460 only approximately 6000 people still lived within Freiburgs city walls A university city Freiburg evolved from its focus on mining to become a cultural centre for the arts and sciences It was also a commercial center The end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance was a time of both advances and tragedy for Freiburg In 1457 Albrecht VI Regent of Further Austria established AlbertLudwigsUniversität one of Germanys oldest universities In 1498 Emperor Maximilian I held a Reichstag in Freiburg In 1520 the city ratified a set of legal reforms widely considered the most progressive of the time The aim was to find a balance between city traditions and old Roman Law The reforms were well received especially the sections dealing with civil process law punishment and the citys constitution In 1520 Freiburg decided not to take part in the Reformation and became an important centre for Catholicism on the Upper Rhine In 1536 a strong and persistent belief in witchcraft led to the citys first witchhunt The need to find a scapegoat for calamities such as the Black Plague which claimed 2000 area residents 25 of the city population in 1564 led to an escalation in witchhunting that reached its peak in 1599 A plaque on the old city wall marks the spot where burnings were carried out The seventeenth eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were turbulent times for Freiburg At the beginning of the Thirty Years War there were 1000014000 citizens in Freiburg by its end only
