 This article is about an atmosphere of a celestial body For Earths atmosphere see Atmosphere of Earth For other uses see Atmosphere disambiguation Atmospheric environment redirects here For the scientific journal see Atmospheric Environment An atmosphere from Greek ἀτμός atmos meaning vapour and σφαῖρα sphaira meaning sphere is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or other material body that is held in place by the gravity of that body An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low The atmosphere of Earth is mostly composed of nitrogen about 78 oxygen about 21 argon about 09 with carbon dioxide and other gases in trace amounts Oxygen is used by most organisms for respiration nitrogen is fixed by bacteria and lightning to produce ammonia used in the construction of nucleotides and amino acids and carbon dioxide is used by plants algae and cyanobacteria for photosynthesis The atmosphere helps protect living organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet radiation solar wind and cosmic rays Its current composition is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms The term stellar atmosphere describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion starting from the opaque photosphere outwards Stars with sufficiently low temperatures may form compound molecules in their outer atmosphere Pressure Main article Atmospheric pressure Atmospheric pressure is the force per unit area that is applied perpendicularly to a surface by the surrounding gas It is determined by a planets gravitational force in combination with the total mass of a column of gas above a location On Earth units of air pressure are based on the internationally recognized standard atmosphere atm which is defined as 101325 kPa 760 Torr or 14696 psi It is measured with a barometer The pressure of an atmospheric gas decreases with altitude due to the diminishing mass of gas above The height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor of e an irrational number with a value of 271828 is called the scale height and is denoted by H For an atmosphere with a uniform temperature the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the product of the mean molecular mass of dry air and the local acceleration of gravity at that location For such a model atmosphere the pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude However atmospheres are not uniform in temperature so the exact determination of the atmospheric pressure at any particular altitude is more complex Atmospheric escape Main article Atmospheric escape Surface gravity the force that holds down an atmosphere differs significantly among the planets For example the large gravitational force of the giant planet Jupiter is able to retain light gases such as hydrogen and helium that escape from objects with lower gravity Secondly the distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules thermal motion exceed the planets escape velocity allowing those to escape a planets gravitational grasp Thus the distant and cold Titan Triton and Pluto are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities Rogue planets theoretically may also retain thick atmospheres Since a collection of gas molecules be moving at a wide range of velocities there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal kinetic energy and so gases of low molecular weight are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight It is thought that Venus and Mars may have lost much of their water when after being photo dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen by solar ultraviolet the hydrogen escaped Earths magnetic field helps to prevent this as normally the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen However over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity including a net 2 of its atmospheric oxygen Other mechanisms that can cause atmosphere depletion are solar windinduced sputtering impact erosion weathering and sequestration—sometimes referred to as freezing out—into the regolith and polar caps Terrain Atmospheres have dramatic effects on the surfaces of rocky bodies Objects that have no atmosphere or that have only an exosphere have terrain that is covered in craters Without an atmosphere the planet has no protection from meteors and all of them collide with the surface and create craters A rocky body with a thick atmosphere does not have significant craters on its surface The friction generated when a meteor enters an atmosphere causes the vast majority of it to burn up before hitting the surface When meteors do impact the effects are often erased by the action of wind As a result craters are rare on objects with atmospheres All objects with atmospheres have wind and weather Wind erosion is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres and over time can erase the effects of both craters and volcanoes In addition since liquids can not exist without pressure an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface resulting in lakes rivers and oceans Earth and Titan are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that Mars had liquid on its surface in the past Composition Initial atmospheric composition is generally related to the chemistry and temperature of the local solar nebula during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases The original atmospheres started with the radially local rotating gases that collapsed to the spaced rings that formed the planets They were then modified over time by various complex factors resulting in quite different outcomes The atmospheres of the planets Venus and Mars are primarily composed of carbon dioxide with small quantities of nitrogen argon oxygen and traces of other gases The atmospheric composition on Earth is largely governed by the byproducts of the life that it sustains Dry air from Earths atmosphere contains 7808 nitrogen 2095 oxygen 093 argon 004 carbon dioxide and traces of hydrogen helium and other noble gases by volume but generally a variable amount of water vapour is also present on average about 1 at sea level The low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar Systems giant planets—Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune—allow them more readily to retain gases with low molecular masses These planets have hydrogen–helium atmospheres with trace amounts of more complex compounds Two satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres Titan a moon of Saturn and Triton a moon of Neptune have atmospheres mainly of nitrogen When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun Pluto has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Tritons but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun Other bodies within the Solar System have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium These include the Moon sodium gas Mercury sodium gas Europa oxygen Io sulfur and Enceladus water vapor The first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is HD 209458b a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the constellation Pegasus Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1000 K and is steadily escaping into space Hydrogen oxygen carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planets inflated atmosphere Structure Earth Main article Atmosphere of Earth Earths atmosphere consists of a number of layers summarised in the diagram above which explains what the layers are that differ in properties such as composition temperature and pressure The lowest layer is the troposphere which extends from the surface to the bottom of the stratosphere Three quarters of the atmospheres mass resides within the troposphere and is the layer within which the Earths weather develops The depth of this layer varies between 17 km at the equator to 7 km at the poles The stratosphere extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the mesosphere contains the ozone layer The ozone layer ranges in altitude between 15 and 35 km and is where most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is absorbed The top of the mesosphere ranges from 50 to 85 km and is the layer wherein most meteors burn up The thermosphere extends from 85 km to the base of the exosphere at 690 km and contains the ionosphere a region where the atmosphere is ionised by incoming solar radiation The ionosphere increases in thickness and moves closer to the Earth during daylight and rises at night allowing certain frequencies of radio communication a greater range The Kármán line located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100 km is commonly used to define the boundary between Earths atmosphere and outer space The exosphere begins variously from about 690 to 1000 km above the surface where it interacts with the planets magnetosphere to space Each of the layers has a different lapse rate defining the rate of change in temperature with height Others Other astronomical bodies such as these listed have known atmospheres In the Solar System Atmosphere of the Sun Atmosphere of Mercury Atmosphere of Venus Atmosphere of Earth Atmosphere of the Moon Atmosphere of Mars Atmosphere

Atmosphere of Titania Atmosphere of Neptune Atmosphere of Triton Atmosphere of Pluto Outside the Solar System Main article Extrasolar atmosphere Atmosphere of HD 209458 b Circulation Main article Atmospheric circulation The circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal differences when convection becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than thermal radiation On planets where the primary heat source is solar radiation excess heat in the tropics is transported to higher latitudes When a planet generates a significant amount of heat internally such as is the case for Jupiter convection in the atmosphere can transport thermal energy from the higher temperature interior up to the surface Importance From the perspective of a planetary geologist the atmosphere is an evolutionary agent essential to the shaping of a planet The wind picks up dust and other particles which when they collide with the terrain erodes the relief and leaves deposits eolian processes Frost and precipitations which depend on the atmospheric composition also influence the relief Climate changes can influence a planets geological history Conversely studying surface of Earth leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and climate of a planet — both its present state and its past For a meteorologist the composition of the atmosphere determines the climate and its variations For a biologist or paleontologist the atmospheric composition is closely dependent on the appearance of the life and its evolution See also Weather portal Atmospheric sciences portal Atmometer evaporimeter
