 This article is about the introduction of agriculture during the Stone Age For later historical breakthroughs in agriculture see Agricultural revolution disambiguation The Neolithic Revolution or Neolithic Demographic Transition sometimes called the Agricultural Revolution was the widescale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement making possible an increasingly larger population These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed This new knowledge led to the domestication of plants Archaeological data indicates that the domestication of various types of plants and animals evolved in separate locations worldwide starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene around 12500 years ago It was the worlds first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available with a switch to agriculture which led to a downturn in human nutrition The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of foodproducing techniques During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of huntergatherers that had hitherto dominated human prehistory into sedentary nonnomadic societies based in builtup villages and towns These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized foodcrop cultivation with eg irrigation and deforestation which allowed extensive surplus food production These developments provided the basis for densely populated settlements specialization and division of labour trading economies the development of nonportable art and architecture centralized administrations and political structures hierarchical ideologies depersonalized systems of knowledge eg writing and property ownership Personal land and private property ownership led to an hierarchical society with an elite Social class comprising a nobility polity and military The first fully developed manifestation of the entire Neolithic complex is seen in the Middle Eastern Sumerian cities c 5500 BP whose emergence also heralded the beginning of the Bronze Age The relationship of the abovementioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture their sequence of emergence and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate and varies from place to place rather than being the outcome of universal laws of social evolution The Levant followed by Mesopotamia are the sites of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10000 BC It has been identified as having inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script mathematics astronomy and agriculture Agricultural transition See also Ancient grains The term Neolithic Revolution was coined in 1923 by V Gordon Childe to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in Middle Eastern history The period is described as a revolution to denote its importance and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10000 to 8000 BC in the Fertile Crescent and perhaps 8000 BC in the Kuk Early Agricultural Site of Melanesia This transition everywhere seems associated with a change from a largely nomadic huntergatherer way of life to a more settled agrarianbased one with the inception of the domestication of various plant and animal species—depending on the species locally available and probably also influenced by local culture Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula the transition from huntergatherer to agriculturalist was not linear but regionspecific There are several competing but not mutually exclusive theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture The most prominent of these are The Oasis Theory originally proposed by Raphael Pumpelly in 1908 popularized by V Gordon Childe in 1928 and summarised in Childes book Man Makes Himself This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward communities contracted to oases where they were forced into close association with animals which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds However today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier The Hilly Flanks hypothesis proposed by Robert Braidwood in 1948 suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the Taurus and Zagros mountains where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication The Feasting model by Brian Hayden suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power such as giving feasts to exert dominance This required assembling large quantities of food which drove agricultural technology The Demographic theories proposed by Carl Sauer and adapted by Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food The evolutionaryintentionality theory developed by David Rindos and others views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants it led to specialization of location and then fullfledged domestication Peter Richerson Robert Boyd and Robert Bettinger make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the Holocene Ronald Wrights book and Massey Lecture Series A Short History of Progress popularized this hypothesis The postulated Younger Dryas impact event claimed to be in part responsible for megafauna extinction and ending the last glacial period could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive The agrarian revolution itself is a reflection of typical overpopulation by certain species following initial events during extinction eras this overpopulation itself ultimately propagates the extinction event Leonid Grinin argues that whatever plants were cultivated the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments eg SouthEast Asia It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East in the hills of Palestine or Egypt So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12000 to 9000 BP though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago Andrew Moore suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the Levant possibly beginning during the Epipaleolithic In A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution Frank Hole further expanded the relationship between plant and animal domestication He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time in as yet unexplored locations He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems He noted that the full range of domesticated animals goats sheep cattle and pigs were not found until the sixth millennium at Tell Ramad Hole concluded that close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the Euphrates basin perhaps as far south as the Arabian Peninsula especially where wadis carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed Domestication of plants Once agriculture started gaining momentum around 9000 BCE human activity resulted in the selective breeding of cereal grasses beginning with emmer einkorn and barley and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest therefore not stored and not seeded the following season years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer Several plant species the pioneer crops or Neolithic founder crops were identified by Daniel Zohary who highlighted the importance of the three cereals and suggested that domestication of flax peas chickpeas bitter vetch and lentils came a little later Based on analysis of the genes of domesticated plants he preferred theories of a single or at most a very small number of domestication events for each taxon that spread in an arc from the Levantine corridor around the Fertile Crescent and later into Europe Gordon Hillman and Stuart Davies carried out experiments with wild wheat varieties to show that the process of domestication would have occurred over a relatively short period of between 20 and 200 years Some of these pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later rye tried and abandoned in Neolithic Anatolia made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe thousands of years after the earliest agriculture Wild lentils presented a different problem most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year the first evidence of lentil domestication breaking dormancy in their first year was found in the early Neolithic at Jerf el Ahmar in modern Syria and quickly spread south to the Netiv HaGdud site in the Jordan Valley This process of domestication allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger more easily harvested more dependable in storage and more useful to the human population Selectively propagated figs wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of Gilgal I where in 2006 archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by intensive gathering at strata datable to c 11000 years ago Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East at sites like Gilgal were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation their crops would yield surpluses that needed storage Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain Eventually granaries were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer So with more food the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools The process was not as linear as was once thought but a more complicated effort which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways Agriculture in the Fertile Crescent Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest Asia around 10000–9000 BP though earlier individual sites have been identified The Fertile Crescent region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals einkorn wheat emmer wheat and barley four legumes lentil pea bitter vetch and chickpea and flax The Mediterranean climate consists of a long dry season with a short period of rain which may have favored small plants with large seeds like wheat and barley The Fertile Crescent also had a large area of varied geographical settings and altitudes and this variety may have made agriculture more profitable for former huntergatherers in this region in comparison with other areas with a similar climate Finds of large quantities of seeds and a grinding stone at the paleolithic site of Ohalo II in the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee dated to around 19400 BP has shown some of the earliest evidence for advanced planning of plant food consumption and suggests that humans at Ohalo II processed the grain before consumption Tell Aswad is oldest site of agriculture with domesticated emmer wheat dated by Willem van Zeist and his assistant Johanna BakkerHeeres to 8800 BC Soon after came hulled tworow barley found domesticated earliest at Jericho in the Jordan valley and Iraq edDubb in Jordan Other sites in the Levantine corridor that show the first evidence of agriculture include Wadi Faynan 16 and Netiv Hagdud Jacques Cauvin noted that the settlers of Aswad did not domesticate on site but arrived perhaps from the neighbouring AntiLebanon already equipped with the seed for planting The Heavy Neolithic Qaraoun culture has been identified at around fifty sites in Lebanon around the source springs of the River Jordan however the dating of the culture has never been reliably determined Agriculture in China Northern China appears to have been the domestication center for foxtail millet Setaria italica and broomcorn millet Panicum miliaceum with evidence of domestication of these species approximately 8000 years ago These species were subsequently widely cultivated in the Yellow River basin 7500 years ago Rice was domesticated in southern China later on Soybean was domesticated in northern China 4500 years ago Orange and peach also originated in China They were cultivated around 2500 BC Agriculture in Europe The fertile Carpathian Basin was the place where Europeans survived the Ice Age The territory between the Danube and the Tisza rivers was a powerhouse of agricultural knowledge Agriculture in Africa On the African continent three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture the Ethiopian highlands the Sahel and West Africa By contrast Agriculture in the Nile River Valley is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the Fertile Crescent Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian Sebilian and Mechian cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated cropbased economy dating around 7000 BP Unlike the Middle East this evidence appears as a false dawn to agriculture as the sites were later abandoned and permanent farming then was delayed until 6500 BP with the Tasian and Badarian cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East Bananas and plantains which were first domesticated in Southeast Asia most likely Papua New Guinea were redomesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5000 years ago Asian yams and taro were also cultivated in Africa The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is coffee In addition khat ensete noog teff and finger millet were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include sorghum and pearl millet The kola nut was first domesticated in West Africa Other crops domesticated in West Africa include African rice yams and the oil palm Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the Bantu expansion during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD Agriculture in the Americas Further information New World Crops Ancient Pueblo Peoples Oasisamerica and ProtoUtoAztecan Maize corn beans and squash were among the earliest crops domesticated in Mesoamerica with maize beginning about 7500 BC squash as early as 8000 to 6000 BC and beans by no later than 4000 BC Potatoes and manioc were domesticated in South America In what is now the eastern United States Native Americans domesticated sunflower sumpweed and goosefoot around 2500 BC At Guilá Naquitz cave in the Mexican highlands fragments of maize pollen bottle gourd and pepo squash were recovered and variously dated between 8000 and 7000 BC In this area of the world people relied on hunting and gathering for several millennia to come Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC referred to as the formative period Agriculture on New Guinea Evidence of drainage ditches at Kuk Swamp on the borders of the Western and Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea shows evidence of the cultivation of taro and a variety of other crops dating back to 11000 BP Two potentially significant economic species taro Colocasia esculenta and yam Dioscorea sp have been identified dating at least to 10200 calibrated years before present cal BP Further evidence of bananas and sugarcane dates to 6950 to 6440 BP This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier CSIRO has found evidence that taro was introduced into the Solomon Islands for human use from 28000 years ago making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world It seems to have resulted in the spread of the Trans–New Guinea languages from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into Timor and adjacent areas of Indonesia This seems to confirm the theories of Carl Sauer who in Agricultural Origins and Dispersals suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture Domestication of animals Further information Domestication When huntergathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand Therefore it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders The animals size temperament diet mating patterns and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals Animals that provided milk such as cows and goats offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable The animal’s ability as a worker for example ploughing or towing as well as a food source also had to be taken into account Besides being a direct source of food certain animals could provide leather wool hides and fertilizer Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs East Asia about 15000 years ago sheep goats cows and pigs Domestication of animals in the Middle East The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated such as sheep goats and pigs This area was also the first region to domesticate the dromedary camel Henri Fleisch discovered and termed the Shepherd Neolithic flint industry from the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest nomadic shepherds He dated this industry to the Epipaleolithic or PrePottery Neolithic as it is evidently not Paleolithic Mesolithic or even Pottery Neolithic The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier many of the farmers were forced to leave taking their domesticated animals with them It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of Afroeurasia This emigration was mainly on an eastwest axis of similar climates as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes For instance wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates Some authors like Jared Diamond have postulated that this EastWest axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the Fertile Crescent to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa while it did not reach through the NorthSouth axis of Africa to reach the Mediterranean climates of South Africa where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years Similarly the African Zebu of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertilecrescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each others region Consequence Social change It has long been taken for granted that the introduction of agriculture had been an unequivocal progress This is now questioned in view of findings by archaeologists and paleopathologists showing that nutritional standards of Neolithic populations were generally inferior to that of huntergatherers and that their life expectancy may well have been shorter too in part due to diseases and harder work Huntergatherers must have covered their food needs with about 20 hours work a week while agriculture required much more and was at least as uncertain The huntergatherers diet was more varied and balanced than what agriculture later allowed Average height went down from 510 178 cm for men and 56 168 cm for women to 55 165 cm and 51 155 cm respectively and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the preNeolithic Revolution levels Agriculturalists had more anaemias and vitamin deficiencies more spinal deformations and more dental pathologies However the decrease in individual nutrition was accompanied by an increase in population The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population which in turn supported larger sedentary communities the accumulation of goods and tools and specialization in diverse forms of new labor The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture industry or commerce but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decisionmaking Jared Diamond in The World Until Yesterday identifies the availability of milk andor cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older eg 3 or 4 year old child and a younger child concurrently whereas this was not possible previously The result is that a population can significantly morerapidly increase its size than would otherwise be the case resources permitting Recent analyses point out that agriculture also brought about deep social divisions and in particular encouraged inequality between the sexes Subsequent revolutions Andrew Sherratt has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the secondary products revolution Animals it appears were first domesticated purely as a source of meat The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products These included hides and skins from undomesticated animals manure for soil conditioning from all domesticated animals wool from sheep llamas alpacas and Angora goats milk from goats cattle yaks sheep horses and camels traction from oxen onagers donkeys horses camels and dogs guarding and herding assistance dogs Sherratt argues that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production and the opening up of heavier soils for farming It also made possible nomadic pastoralism in semi arid areas along the margins of deserts and eventually led to the domestication of both the dromedary and Bactrian camel Overgrazing of these areas particularly by herds of goats greatly extended the areal extent of deserts Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land From such a position it is argued prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others Once trade and a secure food supply were established populations could grow and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food The artisans in turn were able to develop technology such as metal weapons Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently so it is likely that populations that had such organisation perhaps such as that provided by religion were better prepared and more successful In addition the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers Also during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people Ultimately Childe argued that this growing social complexity all rooted in the original decision to settle led to a second Urban Revolution in which the first cities were built Disease Throughout the development of sedentary societies disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which huntergatherer societies existed Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population Some examples of infectious diseases spread from animals to humans are influenza smallpox and measles In concordance with a process of natural selection the humans who first domesticated the big mammals quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival In their approximately 10000 years of shared proximity with animals such as cows Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside Eurasia and Africa For instance the population of most Caribbean and several Pacific Islands have been completely wiped out by diseases 90 or more of many populations of the Americas were wiped out by European and African diseases before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists Some cultures like the Inca Empire did have a large domestic mammal the llama but llama milk was not drunk nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans so the risk of contagion was limited According to bioarchaeological research the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 BP was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions Technology In his book Guns Germs and Steel Jared Diamond argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings both were near a number of easily domesticable plant and animal species and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as firearms and steel swords During and after the Age of Discovery European explorers such as the Spanish conquistadors encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture Archaeogenetics The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers In Europe the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the E1b1b lineages and Haplogroup J that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively In Africa the spread of farming and notably the Bantu expansion is associated with the dispersal of Ychromosome haplogroup E1b1a from West Africa See also Anthropocene Notes and references Bibliography Bailey
