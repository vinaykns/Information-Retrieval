 The Sandia National Laboratories managed and operated by the Sandia Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin until May 1 2017 are two major United States Department of Energy research and development national laboratories In December 2016 it was announced that National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia under the direction of Honeywell International will take over the management of Sandia National Laboratories starting on May 1 2017 Their primary mission is to develop engineer and test the nonnuclear components of nuclear weapons The primary campus is located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque New Mexico and the other is in Livermore California next to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Sandia is a National Nuclear Security Administration laboratory It is Sandias mission to maintain the reliability and surety of nuclear weapon systems conduct research and development in arms control and nonproliferation technologies and investigate methods for the disposal of the United States nuclear weapons programs hazardous waste Other missions include research and development in energy and environmental programs as well as the surety of critical national infrastructures In addition Sandia is home to a wide variety of research including computational biology mathematics through its Computer Science Research Institute materials science alternative energy psychology MEMS and cognitive science initiatives Sandia formerly hosted ASCI Red one of the worlds fastest supercomputers until its recent decommission and now hosts ASCI Red Storm originally known as Thors Hammer Sandia is also home to the Z Machine The Z Machine is the largest Xray generator in the world and is designed to test materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure It is operated by Sandia National Laboratories to gather data to aid in computer modeling of nuclear weapons Lab history Sandia National Laboratories roots go back to World War II and the Manhattan Project Prior to the United States formally entering the war the US Army leased land near an Albuquerque New Mexico airport known as Oxnard Field to service transient Army and US Navy aircraft In January 1941 construction began on the Albuquerque Army Air Base leading to establishment of the Bombardier SchoolArmy Advanced Flying School near the end of the year Soon thereafter it was renamed Kirtland Field after early Army military pilot Colonel Roy C Kirtland and in mid1942 the Army acquired Oxnard Field During the war years facilities were expanded further and Kirtland Field served as a major Army Air Forces training installation In the many months leading up to successful detonation of the first atomic bomb the Trinity test and delivery of the first airborne atomic weapon Project Alberta J Robert Oppenheimer Director of Los Alamos Laboratory and his technical advisor Hartly Rowe began looking for a new site convenient to Los Alamos for the continuation of weapons development – especially its nonnuclear aspects They felt a separate division would be best to perform these functions Kirtland had fulfilled Los Alamos transportation needs for both the Trinity and Alberta projects thus Oxnard Field was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Army Air Corps to the US Army Service Forces Chief of Engineer District and thereafter assigned to the Manhattan Engineer District In July 1945 the forerunner of Sandia Laboratory known as Z Division was established at Oxnard Field to handle future weapons development testing and bomb assembly for the Manhattan Engineer District The Districtdirective calling for establishing a secure area and construction of Z Division facilities referred to this as Sandia Base  after the nearby Sandia Mountains — apparently the first official recognition of the Sandia name Sandia Laboratory was operated by the University of California until 1949 when President Harry S Truman asked Western Electric a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph ATT to assume the operation as an opportunity to render an exceptional service in the national interest Sandia Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of ATT Corporation managed and operated the laboratory until October 1993 The United States Congress designated Sandia Laboratories as a National laboratory in 1979 Today Sandia National Laboratories SNL is managed and operated by Sandia Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation and includes governmentowned facilities in Albuquerque New Mexico SNLNM Livermore California SNLCA Tonopah Nevada and Kauai Hawaii SNLNM is headquarters and the largest laboratory employing more than 6600 employees while SNLCA is a smaller laboratory with about 850 employees Tonopah and Kauai are occupied on a campaign basis as test schedules dictate In December 2016 it was announced that National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia under the direction of Honeywell International will take over the management of Sandia National Laboratories starting on May 1 2017 Legal issues On February 13 2007 a New Mexico State Court found Sandia Corporation liable for 47 million in damages for the firing of a former network security analyst Shawn Carpenter who had reported to his supervisors that hundreds of military installations and defense contractors networks were compromised and sensitive information was being stolen – including hundreds of sensitive Lockheed documents on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter project When his supervisors told him to drop the investigation and do nothing with the information he went to intelligence officials in the United States Army and later the Federal Bureau of Investigation to address the national security breaches When Sandia managers discovered his actions months later they revoked his security clearance and fired him In 2014 an investigation determined Sandia Corp used lab operations funds to pay for lobbying related to the renewal of its 2 billion dollar contract to operate the lab Sandia Corp and its parent company Lockheed Martin agreed to pay a 48 million fine Technical areas SNLNM consists of five technical areas TA and several additional test areas Each TA has its own distinctive operations however the operations of some groups at Sandia may span more than one TA with one part of a team working on a problem from one angle and another subset of the same team located in a different building or area working with other specialized equipment A description of each area is given below TAI operations are dedicated primarily to three activities – the design research and development of weapon systems limited production of weapon system components and energy programs TAI facilities include the main library and offices laboratories and shops used by administrative and technical staff TAII is a 45acre 180000 m² facility that was established in 1948 for the assembly of chemical high explosive main charges for nuclear weapons and later for production scale assembly of nuclear weapons Activities in TAII include the decontamination decommissioning and remediation of facilities and landfills used in past research and development activities Remediation of the Classified Waste Landfill which started in March 1998 neared completion in FY2000 A testing facility the Explosive Component Facility integrates many of the previous TAII test activities as well as some testing activities previously performed in other remote test areas The Access Delay Technology Test Facility is also located in TAII TAIII is adjacent to and south of TAV both are approximately seven miles 11 km south of TAI TAIII facilities include extensive designtest facilities such as rocket sled tracks centrifuges and a radiant heat facility Other facilities in TAIII include a paper destructor the Melting and Solidification Laboratory and the Radioactive and Mixed Waste Management Facility RMWMF RMWMF serves as central processing facility for packaging and storage of lowlevel and mixed waste The remediation of the Chemical Waste Landfill which started in September 1998 is an ongoing activity in TAIII TAIV located approximately 12 mile 1 km south of TAI consists of several inertialconfinement fusion research and pulsed power research facilities including the High Energy Radiation Megavolt Electron Source HermesIII the Z Facility the Short Pulsed High Intensity Nanosecond XRadiator SPHINX Facility and the Saturn Accelerator TAIV also hosts some computer science and cognition research TAV contains two research reactor facilities an intense gamma irradiation facility using cobalt60 and caesium137 sources and the Hot Cell Facility SNLNM also has test areas outside of the five technical areas listed above These test areas collectively known as Coyote Test Field are located southeast of TAIII andor in the canyons on the west side of the Manzanita Mountains Facilities in the Coyote Canyon Test Field include the Solar Tower Facility 349623 N 1065097 W the Lurance Canyon Burn Site and the Aerial Cable Facility Opensource software In the 1970s the Sandia Los Alamos Air Force Weapons Laboratory Technical

National Laboratories collaborates with Kitware Inc in developing the Visualization Toolkit VTK a crossplatform graphics and visualization software suite This collaboration has focused on enhancing the information visualization capabilities of VTK and has in turn fed back into other projects such as ParaView and Titan Selfguided bullet On January 30 2012 Sandia announced that it successfully testfired a selfguided dart that can hit targets at 2000 m 2187 yd The dart is 4 in 100 mm long has its center of gravity at the nose and is made to be fired from a smallcaliber smoothbore gun It is kept straight in flight by four electromagnetically actuated fins encased in a plastic puller sabot that fall off when the dart leaves the bore The dart cannot be fired from conventional rifled barrels because the gyroscopic stability provided by rifling grooves for regular bullets would prevent the selfguided bullet from reliably turning towards a target when in flight so fins are responsible for stabilizing rather than spinning A laser designator marks a target which is tracked by the darts optical sensor and 8bit CPU The guided projectile is kept cheap because it does not need an inertial measurement unit since its small size allows it to make the fast corrections necessary without the aid of an IMU The natural body frequency of the bullet is about 30 hertz so corrections can be made 30 times per second in flight Muzzle velocity with commercial gunpowder is 2400 fts 730 ms Mach 21 but military customized gunpowder can increase its speed and range Computer modeling shows that a standard bullet would miss a target at 1000 m 1094 yd by 98 yd 9 m while an equivalent guided bullet would hit within 8 in 20 cm Accuracy increases as distances get longer since the bullets motions settle more the longer it is in flight See also ASCI Red Titan Rain Shawn Carpenter Z Pulsed Power Facility Red Storm Kirtland Air Force Base National Renewable Energy Laboratory
