 Regenerative design is a processoriented systems theory based approach to design The term regenerative describes processes that restore renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials creating sustainable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of nature The basis is derived from systems ecology with a closed loop input–output model or a model in which the output is greater than or equal to the input with all outputs viable and all inputs accounted for Regenerative design is the biomimicry of ecosystems that provide for all human systems to function as a closed viable ecological economics system for all industry It parallels ecosystems in that organic biotic and synthetic abiotic material is not just metabolized but metamorphosed into new viable materials Ecosystems and regeneratively designed systems are holistic frameworks that seek to create systems that are absolutely waste free The model is meant to be applied to many different aspects of human habitation such as urban environments buildings economics industry and social systems Simply put it is the design of ecosystems and human behavior or culture that function as human habitats Whereas the highest aim of sustainable development is to satisfy fundamental human needs today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs the endgoal of regenerative design is to redevelop systems with absolute effectiveness that allows for the coevolution of the human species along with other thriving species History During the late 1970s John T Lyle 1934–1998 a landscape architecture professor challenged graduate students to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available renewable resources without environmental degradation Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at Cal Poly Pomona In 1992 the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies was built over two years and opened in 1994 In that same year Lyles book Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development was published by Wiley In 1995 Lyle worked with William McDonough at Oberlin College for the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies completed in 2000 In 2002 McDonoughs book the more popular and successful Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle Lyle saw the connection between concepts developed by Bob Rodale of the Rodale Institute for regenerative agriculture and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems With regenerative agriculture the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems more complicated ideas such as entropy and emergy must be taken into consideration Swiss architect Walter R Stahel developed approaches entirely similar to Lyles also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term cradletocradle design made popular by McDonough and Michael Braungart Regenerative versus sustainable Regenerative and sustainable are essentially the same thing except for one key point in a sustainable system lost ecological systems are not returned to existence In a regenerative system those lost systems can ultimately begin regenerating back into existence Put more simply regenerative systems create a better world than we humans found it now and into the future There is also a linguistic problem with the word sustainable which in the strict sense is meant to mean selfsustaining Because the word root sustain means last or endure the general public and even many nonexperts in the industry define the word only as able to last or the capacity to endure In popular usage by designers and product manufacturers sustainable has become a relative term referring to any material process or product including a building which is less toxic or environmental harmful than those conventionally used A product that contains 75 recycled material is often considered sustainable but is in fact merely MORE sustainable than a comparable product that contains no recycled material A truly sustainable material would be one made of 100 recycled material that can in turn be completely recycled into a comparable new material or product This is rarely the case Regenerative also suffers from a slightly different linguistic problem the term is still competing with the biological community in terms of its use for the regrowth of limbs etc However once the word itself gains wide usage its meaning becomes more general much like in the case of the term sustainable The base meaning of regenerative means the capacity to bring into existence again So if an item or system is regenerative the item or system has the capacity to bring itself into existence again Using the example above a truly regenerative product would not only be 100 recycled and recyclable but it would also improve the environmental conditions at the factory where it was made the business where it was used and so on throughout its lifecycle creating habitat filtering water catalyzing nitrogenfixation processes in the soil etc Preservation versus conservation Regenerists place more importance on conservation than on preservation It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time By incorporating people into ecosystems all inputs are pulled from local areas and all outputs are accounted for creating a wasteless system When human systems cease to create waste what would once have been considered waste becomes a resource for the input in which the output comes from Food systems Regenerists call for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce regenerative foods This is often compared to the creation of the demand for organic food Organic foods have a relation to regenerative foods in that regenerative food is all organic but not all organic food is regenerative Organic food is not regenerative if the byproduct of the food crop is not a resource for the next seasons crops and if other inputs for the crop did not come from other resources within the farm which it is grown in Size of regenerative systems The size of the regenerative system effects its regenerativity The smaller a system is designed the more likely it is to be stable and regenerative Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple humaninclusiveecological systems Quantifying regenerativity Due to evolution and the continuing and largely unpredictable changes that occur over the lifetime of Earth it is impossible to create a 100 regenerative system One can only reach 99999 efficiency the ultimate goal However with the energy material interchange it is possible to create enough energy to potentially create the equivalent amount of material used to create the system in the first instance A completed object an object with emergy or embodied energy can however create more energy than was used to create it Ie a solar panel outputting more energy than its given embodied energy However the system used to make up the solar panel the inputs such as the materials for the object silicon and the solar radiation can only be regenerated if enough energy is produced to generate the materials used to make up the solar panel However todays solar panels are not yet that energy efficient See also Sustainable development portal Adam Joseph Lewis Center for
