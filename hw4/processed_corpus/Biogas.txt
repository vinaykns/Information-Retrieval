 Biogas typically refers to a mixture of different gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste manure municipal waste plant material sewage green waste or food waste Biogas is a renewable energy source and in many cases exerts a very small carbon footprint Biogas can be produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic organisms which digest material inside a closed system or fermentation of biodegradable materials Biogas is primarily methane CH 4 and carbon dioxide CO2 and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide H 2S moisture and siloxanes The gases methane hydrogen and carbon monoxide CO can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel it can be used for any heating purpose such as cooking It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat Biogas can be compressed the same way natural gas is compressed to CNG and used to power motor vehicles In the UK for example biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17 of vehicle fuel It qualifies for renewable energy subsidies in some parts of the world Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards when it becomes biomethane Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its productionanduse cycle is continuous and it generates no net carbon dioxide Organic material grows is converted and used and then regrows in a continually repeating cycle From a carbon perspective as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bioresource as is released when the material is ultimately converted to energy Production Main article Anaerobic digestion Biogas is produced as landfill gas LFG which is produced by the breakdown of Biodegradable waste inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes or as digested gas produced inside an anaerobic digester A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes or energy crops It can be produced using anaerobic digesters airtight tanks with different configurations These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste During the process the microorganisms transform biomass waste into biogas mainly methane and carbon dioxide and digestate The biogas is a renewable energy that can be used for heating electricity and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine such as GE Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser There are two key processes mesophilic and thermophilic digestion which is dependent on temperature In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks a 1000litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from mud from a frozen lake in Alaska has produced 200–300 liters of methane per day about 20–30 of the output from digesters in warmer climates Dangers The dangers of biogas are mostly similar to those of natural gas but with an additional risk from the toxicity of its hydrogen sulfide fraction Biogas can be explosive when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to 820 parts air Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water measured by a pressure gauge Frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system Landfill gas Main article Landfill gas Landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a biogas The waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen The lower explosive limit is 5 methane and the upper is 15 methane The methane in biogas is 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide Therefore uncontained landfill gas which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of global warming In addition volatile organic compounds VOCs in landfill gas contribute to the formation of photochemical smog Technical Biochemical oxygen demand BOD is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of water Knowing the energy density of the material being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester Another term related to biodigesters is effluent dirtiness which tells how much organic material there is per unit of biogas source Typical units for this measure are in mg BODlitre As an example effluent dirtiness can range between 800–1200 mg BODlitre in Panama From 1 kg of decommissioned kitchen biowaste 045 m³ of biogas can be obtained The price for collecting biological waste from households is approximately €70 per ton Composition The composition of biogas varies depending upon the origin of the anaerobic digestion process Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around 50 Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55–75 methane which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to 8090 methane using insitu gas purification techniques As produced biogas contains water vapor The fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature correction of measured gas volume for water vapor content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas In some cases biogas contains siloxanes They are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes silicon is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the combustion gas Deposits are formed containing mostly silica SiO 2 or silicates Si xO y and can contain calcium sulfur zinc phosphorus Such white mineral deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means Practical and costeffective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available For 1000 kg wet weight of input to a typical biodigester total solids may be 30 of the wet weight while volatile suspended solids may be 90 of the total solids Protein would be 20 of the volatile solids carbohydrates would be 70 of the volatile solids and finally fats would be 10 of the volatile solids Benefits of manure derived biogas High levels of methane are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions During storage and when manure has been applied to the land nitrous oxide is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process Nitrous oxide N2O is 320 times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and methane 25 times more than carbon dioxide By converting cow manure into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce 100 billion kilowatt hours of electricity enough to power millions of homes across the United States In fact one cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate 3 kilowatt hours of electricity only 24 kilowatt hours of electricity are needed to power a single 100watt light bulb for one day Furthermore by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose global warming gases could be reduced by 99 million metric tons or 4 Applications Biogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works in a CHP gas engine where the waste heat from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester cooking space heating water heating and process heating If compressed it can replace compressed natural gas for use in vehicles where it can fuel an internal combustion engine or fuel cells and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in onsite CHP plants Biogas upgrading Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60 methane and 29 CO 2 with trace elements of H 2S it is not of high enough quality to be used as fuel gas for machinery The corrosive nature of H 2S alone is enough to destroy the internals of a plant Methane in biogas can be concentrated via a biogas upgrader to the same standards as fossil natural gas which itself has to go through a cleaning process and becomes biomethane If the local gas network allows the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept Carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide and particulates must be removed if present There are four main methods of upgrading water washing pressure swing adsorption selexol adsorption and amine gas treating In addition to these the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA The most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counterflow to the gas This arrangement could deliver 98 methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2 methane loss in the system It takes roughly between 3 and 6 of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system Biogas gasgrid injection Gasgrid injection is the injection of biogas into the methane grid natural gas grid Injections includes biogas until the breakthrough of micro combined heat and power twothirds of all the energy produced by biogas power plants was lost the heat using the grid to transport the gas to customers the electricity and the heat can be used for onsite generation resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from 1 to 2 The current energy losses on a large electrical system range from 5 to 8 Biogas in transport If concentrated and compressed it can be used in vehicle transportation Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in Sweden Switzerland and Germany A biogaspowered train named Biogaståget Amanda The Biogas Train Amanda has been in service in Sweden since 2005 Biogas powers automobiles In 1974 a British documentary film titled Sweet as a Nut detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a customadapted combustion engine In 2007 an estimated 12000 vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide mostly in Europe Measuring in biogas environments Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas or air category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow Biogas environments include wastewater digesters landfills and animal feeding operations covered livestock lagoons Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere Most thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking although there are singlepoint insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value Legislation European Union The European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the Landfill Directive Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with longterm revenue and energy security United States The United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains VOCs The United States Clean Air Act and Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of nonmethane organic compounds NMOCs emitted If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds 50 tonnes per year the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs Treatment of the landfill gas is usually by combustion Because of the remoteness of landfill sites it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas Global developments United States With the many benefits of biogas it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more In 2003 the United States consumed 147 trillion BTU of energy from landfill gas about 06 of the total US natural gas consumption Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the US According to a 2008 study collected by the Science and Children magazine methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce 100 billion kilowatt hours enough to power millions of homes across America Furthermore methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce 99 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about 4 of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States In Vermont for example biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program In Sheldon Vermont Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program It started when the brothers who own the farm Bill and Brian Rowell wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms including manure odor and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their 950 cows to produce renewable energy a bedding to replace sawdust and a plantfriendly fertilizer The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program On average the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power 300 to 350 other homes The generator capacity is about 300 kilowatts In Hereford Texas cow manure is being used to power an ethanol power plant By switching to methane biogas the ethanol power plant has saved 1000 barrels of oil a day Over all the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas In Oakley Kansas an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using Integrated Manure Utilization System IMUS to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure municipal organics and ethanol plant waste At full capacity the plant is expected to replace 90 of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol Europe The level of development varies greatly in Europe While countries such as Germany Austria and Sweden are fairly advanced in their use of biogas there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent especially in Eastern Europe Different legal frameworks education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception In February 2009 the European Biogas Association EBA was founded in Brussels as a nonprofit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe EBAs strategy defines three priorities establish biogas as an important part of Europe’s energy mix promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel In July 2013 it had 60 members from 24 countries across Europe UK As of September 2013 there are about 130 nonsewage biogas plants in the UK Most are onfarm and some larger facilities exist offfarm which are taking food and consumer wastes On 5 October 2010 biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time Sewage from over 30000 Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot sewage treatment works where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately 200 homes In 2015 the GreenEnergy company Ecotricity announced their plans to build three gridinjecting digesters Germany Germany is Europes biggest biogas producer and the market leader in biogas technology In 2010 there were 5905 biogas plants operating throughout the country Lower Saxony Bavaria and the eastern federal states are the main regions Most of these plants are employed as power plants Usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a CHP which produces electric power by burning the bio methane The electrical power is then fed into the public power grid In 2010 the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was 2291 MW The electricity supply was approximately 128 TWh which is 126 of the total generated renewable electricity Biogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the cofermentation of energy crops called NawaRo an abbreviation of nachwachsende Rohstoffe German for renewable resources mixed with manure The main crop used is corn Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation In this respect biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common Biogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last 20 years The main reason is the legally created frameworks Government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the Electricity Feedin Act StrEG This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy In 2000 the Electricity Feedin Act was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act EEG This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years The amount of around 8 ¢kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income The German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in 2004 by implementing the socalled NawaRoBonus This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources that is energy crops In 2007 the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the ‘Integrated Climate and Energy Programme’ This continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production The first challenge to be noticed is the high areaconsuming of the biogas electric power supply In 2011 energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa 800000 ha in Germany This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto Moreover new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic political and civil background Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused Indian Subcontinent Biogas in India has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these gobar gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time especially in rural India In the last 23 decades research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model The Deenabandhu Model is a new biogasproduction model popular in India Deenabandhu means friend of the helpless The unit usually has a capacity of 2 to 3 cubic metres It is constructed using bricks or by a ferrocement mixture In India the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model however Indias Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed LPG Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel In India Nepal Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of manure in smallscale digestion facilities is called gobar gas it is estimated that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in India 50000 in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan particularly North Punjab due to the thriving population of livestock The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection The manure is directed to the pit usually straight from the cattle shed The pit is filled with a required quantity of wastewater The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs One type of these system is the Sintex Digester Some designs use vermiculture to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost To create awareness and associate the people interested in biogas the Indian Biogas Association was formed It aspires to be a unique blend of nationwide operators manufacturers and planners of biogas plants and representatives from science and research The association was founded in 2010 and is now ready to start mushrooming Its motto is propagating Biogas in a sustainable way In Pakistan the Rural Support Programmes Network is running the Pakistan Domestic Biogas Programme which has installed 5360 biogas plants and has trained in excess of 200 masons on the technology and aims to develop the Biogas Sector in Pakistan In Nepal the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home China The Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since 1958 Around 1970 China had installed 6000000 digesters in an effort to make agriculture more efficient During the last years the technology has met high growth rates This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste In developing nations Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry the fermented manure This technology is feasible for smallholders with livestock producing 50 kg manure per day an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant Toilets can be connected Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process With an optimum at 36 C° the technology especially applies for those living in a sub tropical climate This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable Depending on size and location a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between US300 to 500 in Asian countries and up to 1400 in the African context A high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least 15–20 years without major problems and reinvestments For the user biogas provides clean cooking energy reduces indoor air pollution and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection especially for women and children The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity Domestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world especially Asia Several countries in this region have embarked on largescale programmes on domestic biogas such as China and India The Netherlands Development Organisation SNV supports national programmes on domestic biogas that aim to establish commercialviable domestic biogas sectors in which local companies market install and service biogas plants for households In Asia SNV is working in Nepal Vietnam Bangladesh Bhutan Cambodia Lao PDR Pakistan and Indonesia and in Africa Rwanda Senegal Burkina Faso Ethiopia Tanzania Uganda Kenya Benin and Cameroon In South Africa a prebuilt Biogas system is manufactured and sold One key feature is that installation requires less skill and is quicker to install as the digester tank is premade plastic Society and culture In the 1985 Australian film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the postapocalyptic settlement Barter town is powered by a central biogas system based upon a piggery As well as providing electricity methane is used to power Barters vehicles Cow Town written in the early 1940s discuss the travails of a city vastly built on cow manure and the hardships brought upon by the resulting methane biogas Carter McCormick an engineer from a town outside the city is sent in to figure out a way to utilize this gas to help power rather than suffocate
