energy transfer Power has dimensions of M L 2 T − 3 displaystyle mathsf ML2mathsf T3 Examples When an objects velocity is held constant at one meter per second against constant opposing force of one newton the rate at which work is done is 1 watt In terms of electromagnetism one watt is the rate at which work is done when one ampere A of current flows through an electrical potential difference of one volt V Two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and Ohms Law Where ohm Ω displaystyle Omega is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance A person having a mass of 100 kilograms who climbs a 3meterhigh ladder in 5 seconds is doing work at a rate of about 600 watts Mass times acceleration due to gravity times height divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the rate of doing work or power A laborer over the course of an 8hour day can sustain an average output of about 75 watts higher power levels can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes Origin and adoption as an SI unit The watt is named after the Scottish scientist James Watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine The measurement unit was recognized by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882 concurrent with the start of commercial power production from both water and steam In 1960 the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted it for the measurement of power into the International System of Units SI Multiples Femtowatt The femtowatt is equal to one quadrillionth 10 of a watt Technologically important powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in references to radio and radar receivers For example meaningful FM tuner performance figures for sensitivity quieting and signaltonoise require that the RF energy applied to the antenna input be specified These input levels are often stated in dBf decibels referenced to 1 femtowatt This is 02739 microvolt across a 75ohm load or 05477 microvolt across a 300ohm load the specification takes into account the RF input impedance of the tuner Picowatt The picowatt is equal to one trillionth 10 of a watt Technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy Nanowatt The nanowatt is equal to one billionth 10 of a watt Important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers Microwatt The microwatt is equal to one millionth 10 of a watt Important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the EEG and the ECG in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers Compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts Milliwatt The milliwatt is equal to one thousandth 10 of a watt A typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt Audio signals and other electronic signal levels are often measured in dBm referenced to one milliwatt Kilowatt Kilowatt and Kilowatts redirect here For the place in the United States see Kilowatt California For the musician James Watts see KiloWatts musician KW redirects here For other uses see KW disambiguation The kilowatt is equal to one thousand 10 watts This unit is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power of electric motors tools machines and heaters It is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters One kilowatt is approximately equal to 134 horsepower A small electric heater with one heating element can use 10 kilowatt The average electric power consumption of a household in the United States is about one kilowatt Also kilowatts of light power can be measured in the output pulses of some lasers A surface area of one square meter on Earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the sun the solar irradiance on a clear day at mid day close to the equator Megawatt The megawatt is equal to one million 10 watts Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale including large electric motors large warships such as aircraft carriers cruisers and submarines large server farms or data centers and some scientific research equipment such as supercolliders and the output pulses of very large lasers A large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat On railways modern highpowered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6 MW although some produce much more The Eurostar for example uses more than 12 MW while heavy dieselelectric locomotives typically produceuse 3 to 5 MW US nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300 MW The earliest citing of the megawatt in the Oxford English Dictionary OED is a reference in the 1900 Websters International Dictionary of English Language The OED also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 November 1947 article in the journal Science 5062 Gigawatt The gigawatt is equal to one billion 10 watts or 1 gigawatt 1000 megawatts This unit is often used for large power plants or power grids For example by the end of 2010 power shortages in Chinas Shanxi province were expected to increase to 5–6 GW and the installed capacity of wind power in Germany was 258 GW The largest unit out of four of the Belgian Doel Nuclear Power Station has a peak output of 104 GW HVDC converters have been built with power ratings of up to 2 GW Terawatt The terawatt is equal to one trillion 10 watts The total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts see primary energy The most powerful lasers from the mid1960s to the mid1990s produced power in terawatts but only for nanosecond time frames The average lightning strike peaks at 1 terawatt but these strikes only last for 30 microseconds Petawatt The petawatt is equal to one quadrillion 10 watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for timescales on the order of picoseconds 10 s One such laser is the Lawrence Livermores Nova laser which achieved a power output of 125 PW 7015125000000000000♠125×10 W by a process called chirped pulse amplification The duration of the pulse was roughly 05 ps 6987500000000000000♠5×10 s giving a total energy of 600 J or enough energy to power a 100 W light bulb for six seconds Another example is the Laser for Fast Ignition Experiments LFEX at the Institute of Laser Engineering ILE Osaka University which achieved a power output of 2 PW 7015200000000000000♠2×10 W for a duration of approximately 1 ps Based on the average total solar irradiance of 1366 kWm the total power of sunlight striking Earths atmosphere is estimated at 174 PW see solar constant Conventions in the electric power industry In the electric power industry megawatt electrical MWe or MWe refers by convention to the electric power produced by a generator while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt MWt MWt or MWth MWth refers to thermal power produced by the plant For example the Embalse nuclear power plant in Argentina uses a fission reactor to generate 2109 MWt ie heat which creates steam to drive a turbine which generates 648 MWe ie electricity Other SI prefixes are sometimes used for example gigawatt electrical GWe The International Bureau of Weights and Measures which maintains the SIstandard states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol ie Pthermal  270 W rather than P  270 Wth and so these units are nonSI In compliance with SI the energy company DONG Energy uses the unit megawatt for produced electrical power and the equivalent unit megajoules for delivered heating power in a combined heat and power station such as Avedøre Power Station When describing alternating current AC electricity another distinction is made between the watt and the voltampere While these units are equivalent for simple resistive circuits they differ when loads exhibit electrical reactance Radio transmission Main article Effective radiated power Radio stations usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts referring to the effective radiated power It refers to the relative power of the transmission when it is directed towards the horizon for maximum geographic coverage rather than uniformly broadcast in all directions Confusion of watts watthours and watts per hour The terms power and energy are frequently confused Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units eg watts that represent energy per unit time For example when a light bulb with a power rating of 100W is turned on for one hour the energy used is 100 watt hours W·h 01 kilowatt hour or 360 kJ This same amount of energy would light a 40watt bulb for 25 hours or a 50watt bulb for 2 hours A power station would be rated in multiples of watts for example the Three Gorges Dam is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts but its annual energy sales or output would be in multiples of watt hours Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year One terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year The watt second is a unit of energy equal to the joule One kilowatt hour is 3 600 000 watt seconds The watt second is used for example to rate the energy storage of flash lamps used in photography although the term joule is generally employed Terms such as watts per hour Wh are often misused when watts would be correct Watts per hour properly refers to a change of power per hour Watts per hour might be useful to characterize the rampup behavior of power plants For example a power plant that changes its power output from 0 MW to 1 MW in 15 minutes has a rampup rate of 4 MWh Hydroelectric power plants have a very high rampup rate which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations The misnomer watts per hour is essentially the derivative of power and should be called rate of watt change per hour See also Conversion of units Declared net capacity power
