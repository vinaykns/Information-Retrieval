 A land ethic is a philosophy or theoretical framework about how ethically humans should regard the land The term was coined by Aldo Leopold 1887–1948 in his A Sand County Almanac 1949 a classic text of the environmental movement There he argues that there is a critical need for a new ethic an ethic dealing with humans relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it Leopold offers an ecologicallybased land ethic that rejects strictly humancentered views of the environment and focuses on the preservation of healthy selfrenewing ecosystems A Sand County Almanac was the first systematic presentation of a holistic or ecocentric approach to the environment Although Leopold is credited with coining the term land ethic there are many philosophical theories that speak to how humans should treat the land Some of the most prominent land ethics include those rooted in economics utilitarianism libertarianism egalitarianism and ecology Economics based land ethic This is a land ethic based wholly upon economic selfinterest Leopold sees two flaws in this type of ethic First he argues that most members of an ecosystem have no economic worth For this reason such an ethic can ignore or even eliminate these members when they are actually necessary for the health of the biotic community of the land And second it tends to relegate conservation necessary for healthy ecosystems to the Government and these tasks are too large and dispersed to be adequately addressed by such an institution This ties directly into the context within which Leopold wrote Sand County Almanac For example when the US Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot the prevailing ethos was economic and utilitarian Leopold argued for an ecological approach becoming one of the first to popularize this term created by Henry Chandler Cowles of the University of Chicago during his early 1900s research at the Indiana Dunes Conservation became the preferred term for the more anthropocentric model of resource management while the writing of Leopold and his inspiration John Muir led to the development of environmentalism Utilitarian based land ethic Utilitarianism was first put forth by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill Though there are many varieties of utilitarianism generally it is the view that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people Utilitarianism has often been used when deciding how to use land and it is closely connected with an economic based ethic For example it forms the foundation for industrial farming as an increase in yield which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land is judged from this view to be a good action or approach In fact a common argument in favor of industrial agriculture is this it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices However a utilitarian based land ethic is different from a purely economic one as it could be used to justify the limiting of a persons rights to make profit For example in the case of the farmer planting crops on a slope if the runoff of soil into the community creek led to the damage of several neighbors properties then the good of the individual farmer would be overridden by the damage caused to his neighbors Thus while a utilitarian based land ethic can be used to support economic activity it can also be used to challenge this activity Libertarian based land ethic Another philosophical approach often used to guide actions when making or not making changes to the land is libertarianism Roughly libertarianism is the ethical view that agents own themselves and have particular moral rights including the right to acquire property In a looser sense libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each individual person has a right to a maximum amount of freedom or liberty when this freedom does not interfere with other peoples freedom A well known libertarian theorist is John Hospers For libertarians property rights are natural rights Thus it would be acceptable for the above farmer to plant on a slope as long as this action does not limit the freedom of his or her neighbors This view is closely connected to utilitarianism Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments to support their own arguments For example in 1968 Garrett Hardin applied this philosophy to land issues when he argued that the only solution to the Tragedy of the Commons was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens Hardin then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument However you could argue that this possibly leaves a libertarian based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic based approaches Even excepting this the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that people making selfinterested decisions often cause large ecological disasters such as the Dust Bowl disaster Even so libertarianism is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and especially held by US ranchers and farmers Egalitarian based land ethic Egalitarian based land ethics are often developed as a response to libertarianism This is because while libertarianism ensures the maximum amount of human liberty it does not require that people help others In addition it also leads to the uneven distribution of wealth A well known egalitarian philosopher is John Rawls When focusing on land use what this translates into is its uneven distribution and the uneven distribution of the fruits of that land While both a utilitarian and libertarian based land ethic could conceivably rationalize this maldistribution an egalitarian approach typically favors equality whether that be equal entitlement to land andor access to food However there is also the question of negative rights when holding to an egalitarian based ethic In other words if you recognize that a person has a right to something then someone has the responsibility to supply this opportunity or item whether that be an individual person or the government Thus an egalitarian based land ethic could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water because it links land and water with the right to food with the growth of human populations and the decline of soil and water resources Ecologically based land ethic In addition to economic utilitarian libertarian and egalitarian based land ethics there are also land ethics based upon the principle that the land and the organisms that live off the land has intrinsic value These ethics are roughly coming out of an ecological or systems view This position was first put forth by Ayers Brinser in Our Use of the Land published in 1939 Brinser argued that white settlers brought with them the seeds of a civilization which has grown by consuming the land that is a civilization which has used up the land in much the same way that a furnace burns coal” Later Aldo Leopolds posthumously published Sand County Almanac popularized this idea Another examples is the deep ecology view which argues that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities and that all life is of inherent worth Similar to egalitarian based land ethics the above land ethics were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian based approaches Leopolds ethic is currently one of the most popular ecological approaches Other writers and theorists who hold this view include Wendell Berry b 1934 N Scott Momaday J Baird Callicott Paul B Thompson and Barbara Kingsolver Aldo Leopolds land ethic In his classic essay The Land Ethic published posthumously in A Sand County Almanac Leopold proposes that the next step in the evolution of ethics is the expansion of ethics to include nonhuman members of the biotic community collectively referred to as the land Leopold states the basic principle of his land ethic as A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community It is wrong when it tends otherwise He also describes it in this way The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils waters plants and animals or collectively the land A land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the landcommunity to plain member and citizen of it It implies respect for his fellowmembers and also respect for the community as such Leopold was a naturalist not a philosopher and there is much debate about what exactly Leopolds land ethic asserts and how he argues for it At its core the land ethics claims 1 that humans should view themselves as plain members and citizens of biotic communities not as conquerors of the land 2 that we should extend ethical consideration to ecological wholes soils waters plants and animals 3 that our primary ethical concern should not be with individual plants or animals but with the healthy functioning of whole biotic communities and 4 that the summary moral maxim of ecological ethics is that we should seek to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community Beyond this scholars disagree about the extent to which Leopold rejected traditional humancentered approaches to the environment and how literally he intended his basic moral maxim to be applied They also debate whether Leopold based his land ethic primarily on humancentered interests as many passages in A Sand County Almanac suggest or whether he placed significant weight on the intrinsic value of nature One prominent student of Leopold J Baird Callicott has suggested that Leopold grounded his land ethics on various scientific claims including a Darwinian view of ethics as rooted in special affections for kith and kin a Copernican view of humans as plain members of nature and the cosmos and the finding of modern ecology that ecosystems are complex interrelated wholes However this interpretation has recently been challenged by Roberta Millstein who has offered evidence that Darwins influence on Leopold was not related to Darwins views about moral sentiments but rather to Darwins views about interdependence in the struggle for existence Attractions of Leopolds land ethic Leopolds ecocentric land ethic is popular today with mainstream environmentalists for a number of reasons Unlike more radical environmental approaches such as deep ecology or biocentrism it does not require huge sacrifices of human interests Leopold does not for example believe that humans should stop eating or hunting or experimenting on animals Nor does he call for a massive reduction in human population or for permitting humans to interfere with nature only to satisfy vital human needs regardless of economic or other human costs As an environmental ethic Leopolds land ethic is a comparatively moderate view that seeks to strike a balance between human interests and a healthy and biotically diverse natural environment Many of the things mainstream environmentalists favorpreference for native plants and animals over invasive species hunting or selective culling to control overpopulated species that are damaging to the environment and a focus on preserving healthy selfregenerating natural ecosystems both for human benefit and for their own intrinsic valuejibe with Leopolds ecocentric land ethic Criticisms Some critics fault Leopold for lack of clarity in spelling out exactly what the land ethic is and its specific implications for how humans should think about the environment It is clear that Leopold did not intend his basic normative principle A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community to be regarded as an ethical absolute Thus construed it would prohibit clearing land to build homes schools or farms and generally require a handsoff approach to nature that Leopold plainly did not favor Presumably therefore his maxim should be seen as a general guideline for valuing natural ecosystems and striving to achieve what he terms a sustainable state of harmony between men and land But this is vague and according to some critics not terribly helpful A second common criticism of Leopold is that he fails to state clearly why we should adopt the land ethic He often cites examples of environmental damage eg soil erosion pollution and deforestation that result from traditional humancentered conqueror attitudes towards nature But it is unclear why such examples support the land ethic specifically as opposed to biocentricism or some other naturefriendly environmental ethic Leopold also frequently appeals to modern ecology evolutionary theory and other scientific discoveries to support his land ethic Some critics have suggested that such appeals may involve an illicit move from facts to values At a minimum such critics claim more should be said about the normative basis of Leopolds land ethic Other critics object to Leopolds ecological holism According to animal rights advocate Tom Regan Leopolds land ethic condones sacrificing the good of individual animals to the good of the whole and is thus a form of environmental fascism According to these critics we rightly reject such holistic approaches in human affairs Why they ask should we adopt them in our treatment of nonhuman animals Finally some critics have questioned whether Leopolds land ethic might require unacceptable interferences with nature in order to protect current but transient ecological balances If the fundamental environmental imperative is to preserve the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems wouldnt this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments In nature the stability and integrity of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought fire storms pests newly invasive predators etc Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes and if so at what cost Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances Why think it is our role to be natures steward or policeman According to these critics Leopolds stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly humancentered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves See also Environment portal Ecology portal Earth sciences portal Biology portal Sustainable development portal Agrarianism Biomimicry
