 Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the development and use of land planning permission protection and use of the environment public welfare and the design of the urban environment including air water and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas such as transportation communications and distribution networks Urban planning is also referred to as urban and regional planning regional planning town planning city planning rural planning or some combination in various areas worldwide It takes many forms and it can share perspectives and practices with urban design Urban planning guides orderly development in urban suburban and rural areas Although predominantly concerned with the planning of settlements and communities urban planning is also responsible for the planning and development of water use and resources rural and agricultural land parks and conserving areas of natural environmental significance Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis strategic thinking architecture urban design public consultation policy recommendations implementation and management Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture landscape architecture civil engineering and public administration to achieve strategic policy and sustainability goals Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields Today urban planning is a separate independent professional discipline The discipline is the broader category that includes different subfields such as landuse planning zoning economic development environmental planning and transportation planning History Further information History of urban planning There is evidence of urban planning and designed communities dating back to the Mesopotamian Indus Valley Minoan and Egyptian civilizations in the third millennium BCE Archeologists studying the ruins of cities in these areas find paved streets that were laid out at right angles in a grid pattern The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it Beginning in the 8th century BCE Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal or gridlike plans The ancient Romans inspired by the Greeks also used orthogonal plans for their cities City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning As the Roman Empire declined these ideas slowly disappeared However many cities in Europe still held onto the planned Roman city center Cities in Europe from the 9th to 14th centuries often grew organically and sometimes chaotically But many hundreds of new towns were newly built according to preconceived plans and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions Most of these were realized from the 12th to 14th centuries with a peakperiod at the end of the 13th From the 15th century on much more is recorded of urban design and the people that were involved In this period theoretical treatises on architecture and urban planning start to appear in which theoretical questions are addressed and designs of towns and cities are described and depicted During the Enlightenment period several European rulers ambitiously attempted to redesign capital cities During the Second French Republic Baron GeorgesEugène Haussmann under the direction of Napoleon III redesigned the city of Paris into a more modern capital with long straight wide boulevards Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century The industrialized cities of the 19th century grew at a tremendous rate The pace and style of this industrial construction was largely dictated by the concerns of private business The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern The laissezfaire style of government management of the economy in fashion for most of the Victorian era was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged Around 1900 theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age by providing citizens especially factory workers with healthier environments Urban planning started to become professionalized during this time The Town and Country Planning Association was founded in 1899 and the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the University of Liverpool in 1909 In the 1920s the ideas of modernism and uniformity began to surface in urban planning and lasted until the 1970s Many planners started to believe that the ideas of modernism in urban planning led to higher crime rates and social problems Urban planners now focus more on individualism and diversity in urban centers Theories Further information Theories of urban planning Planning theory is the body of scientific concepts definitions behavioral relationships and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today the rationalcomprehensive approach the incremental approach the transactive approach the communicative approach the advocacy approach the equity approach the radical approach and the humanist or phenomenological approach Technical aspects Further information Technical aspects of urban planning Technical aspects of urban planning involve the applying scientific technical processes considerations and features that are involved in planning for land use urban design natural resources transportation and infrastructure Urban planning includes techniques such as predicting population growth zoning geographic mapping and analysis analyzing park space surveying the water supply identifying transportation patterns recognizing food supply demands allocating healthcare and social services and analyzing the impact of land use Urban planners Further information Urban planner An urban planner is a professional who works in the field of urban planning for the purpose of optimizing the effectiveness of a communitys land use and infrastructure They formulate plans for the development and management of urban and suburban areas typically analyzing land use compatibility as well as economic environmental and social trends In developing the plan for a community whether commercial residential agricultural natural or recreational urban planners must also consider a wide array of issues such as sustainability air pollution traffic congestion crime land values legislation and zoning codes The importance of the urban planner is increasing throughout the 21st century as modern society begins to face issues of increased population growth climate change and unsustainable development An urban planner could be considered a green collar professional See also Architecture portal
