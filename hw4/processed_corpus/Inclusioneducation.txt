 Not to be confused with Inclusion disability rights Inclusion in education is an approach to educating students with special educational needs Under the inclusion model students with special needs spend most or all of their time with nonspecial needs students Inclusion rejects the use of special schools or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities Implementation of these practices varies Schools most frequently use the inclusion model for selected students with mild to moderate special needs Fully inclusive schools which are rare do not separate general education and special education programs instead the school is restructured so that all students learn together Inclusive education differs from the integration or mainstreaming model of education which tended to be concerned principally with disability and special educational needs and learners changing or becoming ready for or deserving of accommodation by the mainstream By contrast inclusion is about the childs right to participate and the schools duty to accept the child A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities and upon respect for their social civil and educational rights Feeling included is not limited to physical and cognitive disabilities but also includes the full range of human diversity with respect to ability language culture gender age and of other forms of human differences Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett wrote student performance and behaviour in educational tasks can be profoundly affected by the way we feel we are seen and judged by others When we expect to be viewed as inferior our abilities seem to diminish Integration and mainstreaming Inclusion has different historical roots which may be integration of students with severe disabilities in the US who may previously been excluded from schools or even lived in institutions or an inclusion model from Canada and the US eg Syracuse University New York which is very popular with inclusion teachers who believe in participatory learning cooperative learning and inclusive classrooms Inclusive education differs from the early university professors work eg 1970s Education Professor Carol Berrigan of Syracuse University 1985 Douglas Biklen Dean of School of Education through 2011 in integrationintegration and mainstreaming which were taught throughout the world including in international seminars in Italy Mainstreaming eg the Human Policy Press poster If you thought the wheel was a good idea youll like the ramptended to be concerned about readiness of all parties for the new coming together of students with significant needs Thus integration and mainstreaming principally was concerned about disability and special educational needs since the children were not in the regular schools and involved teachers students principals administrators School Boards and parents changing and becoming ready for students who needed accommodation or new methods of curriculum and instruction eg required federal IEPs – individualized education program by the mainstream By contrast inclusion is about the child’s right to participate and the school’s duty to accept the child returning to the US Supreme Courts Brown vs the Board of Education decision and the new Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act IDEIA Inclusion rejects the use of special schools or classrooms which remain popular among large multiservice providers to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities in contrast to earlier concept of partial participation in the mainstream and upon respect for their social civil and educational rights Inclusion gives students with disabilities skills they can use in and out of the classroom Fully inclusive schools and general or special education policies Fully inclusive schools which are rare no longer distinguish between general education and special education programs which refers to the debates and federal initiatives of the 1980s such as the Community Integration Project and the debates on home schools and special educationregular education classrooms instead the school is restructured so that all students learn together All approaches to inclusive schooling require administrative and managerial changes to move from the traditional approaches to elementary and high school education Inclusion remains in 2015 as part of school eg Powell Lyle 1997 now to the most integrated setting from LRE and educational reform initiatives in the US and other parts of the world Inclusion is an effort to improve quality in education in the fields of disability is a common theme in educational reform for decades and is supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities UN 2006 Inclusion has been researched and studied for decades though reported lighly in the public with early studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous ability groupings Stainback Stainback 1989 studies of critical friends and inclusion facilitators eg Jorgensen Tashie 2000 selfcontained to general education reversal of 90 Fried Jorgensen 1998 among many others obtaining doctoral degrees throughout the US Classification of students and educational practices Classification of students by disability is standard in educational systems which use diagnostic educational and psychological testing among others However inclusion has been associated with its own planning including MAPS which Jack Pearpoint leads with still leads in 2015 and personcentred planning with John OBrien and Connie Lyle OBrien who view inclusion as a force for school renewal Inclusion has two subtypes the first is sometimes called regular inclusion or partial inclusion and the other is full inclusion Inclusive practice is not always inclusive but is a form of integration For example students with special needs are educated in regular classes for nearly all of the day or at least for more than half of the day Whenever possible the students receive any additional help or special instruction in the general classroom and the student is treated like a full member of the class However most specialized services are provided outside a regular classroom particularly if these services require special equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class such as speech therapy and students are pulled out of the regular classroom for these services In this case the student occasionally leaves the regular classroom to attend smaller more intensive instructional sessions in a resource room or to receive other related services such as speech and language therapy occupational andor physical therapy psychological services and social work This approach can be very similar to many mainstreaming practices and may differ in little more than the educational ideals behind it In the full inclusion setting the students with special needs are always educated alongside students without special needs as the first and desired option while maintaining appropriate supports and services Some educators say this might be more effective for the students with special needs At the extreme full inclusion is the integration of all students even those that require the most substantial educational and behavioral supports and services to be successful in regular classes and the elimination of special segregated special education classes Special education is considered a service not a place and those services are integrated into the daily routines See ecological inventories and classroom structure environment curriculum and strategies and brought to the student instead of removing the student to meet his or her individual needs However this approach to full inclusion is somewhat controversial and it is not widely understood or applied to date Much more commonly local educational agencies have the responsibility to organize services for children with disabilities They may provide a variety of settings from special classrooms to mainstreaming to inclusion and assign as teachers and administrators often do students to the system that seems most likely to help the student achieve his or her individual educational goals Students with mild or moderate disabilities as well as disabilities that do not affect academic achievement such as using power wheelchair scooter or other mobility device are most likely to be fully included indeed children with polio or with leg injuries have grown to be leaders and teachers in government and universities self advocates travel across the country and to different parts of the world However students with all types of disabilities from all the different disability categories See also 2012 book by Michael Wehmeyer from the University of Kansas have been successfully included in general education classes working and achieving their individual educational goals in regular school environments and activities reference needed Alternatives to inclusion programs school procedures and community development Students with disabilities who are not included are typically either mainstreamed or segregated A mainstreamed student attends some general education classes typically for less than half the day and often for less academically rigorous or if you will more interesting and careeroriented classes For example a young student with significant intellectual disabilities might be mainstreamed for physical education classes art classes and storybook time but spend reading and mathematics classes with other students that have similar disabilities needs for the same level of academic instruction They may have access to a resource room for remediation or enhancement of course content or for a variety of group and individual meetings and consultations A segregated student attends no classes with nondisabled students with disability a tested category determined before or at school entrance He or she might attend a special school termed residential schools that only enrolls other students with disabilities or might be placed in a dedicated selfcontained classroom in a school that also enrolls general education students The latter model of integration like the 1970s Jowonio School in Syracuse is often highly valued when combined with teaching such as Montessori education techniques Home schooling was also a popular alternative among highly educated parents with children with significant disabilities Residential schools have been criticized for decades and the government has been asked repeatedly to keep funds and services in the local districts including for family support services for parents who may be currently single and raising a child with significant challenges on their own Children with special needs may already be involved with early childhood education which can have a family support component emphasizing the strengths of the child and family Some students may be confined to a hospital due to a medical condition eg cancer treatments and are thus eligible for tutoring services provided by a school district Less common alternatives include homeschooling and particularly in developing countries exclusion from education Legal issues education law and disability laws The new antidiscriminatory climate has provided the basis for much change in policy and statute nationally and internationally Inclusion has been enshrined at the same time that segregation and discrimination have been rejected Articulations of the new developments in ways of thinking in policy and in law include The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 which sets out children’s rights in respect of freedom from discrimination and in respect of the representation of their wishes and views The Convention against Discrimination in Education of UNESCO prohibits any discrimination exclusion or segregation in education The UNESCO Salamanca Statement 1994 which calls on all governments to give the highest priority to inclusive education The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006 which calls on all States Parties to ensure an inclusive education system at all levels From the least restrictive to the most integrated setting For schools in the United States the federal requirement that students be educated in the historic least restrictive environment that is reasonable encourages the implementation of inclusion of students previously excluded by the school system However a critical critique of the LRE principle commonly used to guide US schools indicates that it often places restrictions and segregation on the individuals with the most severe disabilities By the late 1980s individuals with significant disabilities and their families and caregivers were already living quality lives in homes and local communities Luckily the US Supreme Court has now ruled in the Olmstead Decision 1999 that the new principle is that of the most integrated setting as described by the national Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities which should result in better achievement of national integration and inclusion goals in the 21st Century Inclusion rates in the world frequency of use The proportion of students with disabilities who are included varies by place and by type of disability but it is relatively common for students with milder disabilities and less common with certain kinds of severe disabilities In Denmark 99 of students with learning disabilities like dyslexia are placed in general education classrooms In the United States three out of five students with learning disabilities spend the majority of their time in the general education classroom Postsecondary statistics after high school are kept by universities and government on the success rates of students entering college and most are eligible for either disability services eg accommodations and aides or programs on college campuses such as supported education in psychiatric disabilities or College for Living The former are fully integrated college degree programs with college and vocational rehabilitation services eg payments for textbooks readers or translators and the latter courses developed similar to retirement institutes eg banking for retirees Principles and necessary resources Although once hailed usually by its opponents as a way to increase achievement while decreasing costs full inclusion does not save money but is more costbeneficial and costeffective It is not designed to reduce students needs and its first priority may not even be to improve academic outcomes in most cases it merely moves the special education professionals now dual certified for all students in some states out of their own special education classrooms and into a corner of the general classroom or as otherwise designed by the teacherincharge and administratorincharge To avoid harm to the academic education of students with disabilities a full panoply of services and resources is required of education for itself including Adequate supports and services for the student Welldesigned individualized education programs Professional development for all teachers involved general and special educators alike Time for teachers to plan meet create and evaluate the students together Reduced class size based on the severity of the student needs Professional skill development in the areas of cooperative learning peer tutoring adaptive curriculum Collaboration between parents or guardians teachers or para educators specialists administration and outside agencies Sufficient funding so that schools will be able to develop programs for students based on student need instead of the availability of funding Indeed the students with special needs do receive funds from the federal government by law originally the Educational for All Handicapped Children Act of 1974 to the present day Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act which requires its use in the most integrated setting In principle several factors can determine the success of inclusive classrooms Familyschool partnerships Collaboration between general and special educators Wellconstructed plans that identify specific accommodations modifications and goals for each student Coordinated planning and communication between general and special needs staff Integrated service delivery Ongoing training and staff development Leadership of teachers and administrators By the mid1980s school integration leaders in the university sector already had detailed schemas eg curriculum student days students with severe disabilities in classrooms with later developments primarily in assistive technology and communication school reform and transformation personal assistance of userdirected aides and increasing emphasis on social relationships and cooperative learning In 2015 most important are evaluations of the populations still in special schools including those who may be deafblind and the leadership by inclusion educators who often do not yet go by that name in the education and community systems Differing views of inclusion and integration However early integrationists community integration would still recommend greater emphasis on programs related to sciences the arts eg exposure curriculum integrated field trips and literature as opposed to the sole emphasis on community referenced curriculum For example a global citizen studying the environment might be involved with planting a tree independent mobility or going to an arboretum social and relational skills developing a science project with a group contributing ideas and planning and having two core modules in the curriculum However students will need to either continue to secondary school meet academic testing standards make arrangements for employment supported education or homeday services transition services and thus develop the skills for future life eg academic math skills and calculators planning and using recipes or leisure skills in the educational classrooms Inclusion often involved individuals who otherwise might be at an institution or residential facility Today longitudinal studies follow the outcomes of students with disabilities in classrooms which include college graduations and quality of life outcomes To be avoided are negative outcomes that include forms of institutionalization Common practices in inclusive classrooms Students in an inclusive classroom are generally placed with their chronological agemates regardless of whether the students are working above or below the typical academic level for their age Also to encourage a sense of belonging emphasis is placed on the value of friendships Teachers often nurture a relationship between a student with special needs and a sameage student without a special educational need Another common practice is the assignment of a buddy to accompany a student with special needs at all times for example in the cafeteria on the playground on the bus and so on This is used to show students that a diverse group of people make up a community that no one type of student is better than another and to remove any barriers to a friendship that may occur if a student is viewed as helpless Such practices reduce the chance for elitism among students in later grades and encourage cooperation among groups Teachers use a number of techniques to help build classroom communities Using games designed to build community Involving students in solving problems Sharing songs and books that teach community Openly dealing with individual differences by discussion Assigning classroom jobs that build community Teaching students to look for ways to help each other Utilizing physical therapy equipment such as standing frames so students who typically use wheelchairs can stand when the other students are standing and more actively participate in activities Encouraging students to take the role of teacher and deliver instruction eg read a portion of a book to a student with severe disabilities Focusing on the strength of a student with special needs Create classroom checklists Take breaks when necessary Create an area for children to calm down Organize student desk in groups Create a self and welcoming environment Set ground rules and stick with them Help establish shortterm goals Design a multifaced curriculum Communicate regular with parents andor caregivers Seek support from other special education teachers Inclusionary practices are commonly utilized by using the following teamteaching models One teach one support In this model the content teacher will deliver the lesson and the special education teacher will assist students individual needs and enforce classroom management as needed One teach one observe In this model the teacher with the most experience in the content will deliver the lesson and the other teacher will float or observe This model is commonly used for data retrieval during IEP observations or Functional Behavior Analysis Station teaching rotational teaching In this model the room is divided into stations in which the students will visit with their small groups Generally the content teacher will deliver the lesson in hisher group and the special education teacher will complete a review or adapted version of the lesson with the students Parallel teaching In this model one half of the class is taught by the content teacher and one half is taught by the special education teacher Both groups are being taught the same lesson just in a smaller group Alternative teaching In this method the content teacher will teach the lesson to the class while the special education teacher will teach a small group of students an alternative lesson Team teaching contentsupport shared 5050 Both teachers share the planning teaching and supporting equally This is the traditional method and often the most successful coteaching model Children with extensive support needs For children with significant or severe disabilities the programs may require what are termed health supports eg positioning and lifting visit to the nurse clinic direct onetoone aide in the classroom assistive technology and an individualized program which may involve the student partially eg videos and cards for visual stimulation listening to responsesin the full lesson plan for the general education student It may also require introduction of teaching techniques commonly used eg introductions and interest in science that teachers may not use within a common core class Another way to think of health supports are as a range of services that may be needed from specialists or sometimes generalists ranging from speech and language to visual and hearing sensory impairments behavioral learning orthopedics autism deafblindness and traumatic brain injury according to Virginia Commonwealth Universitys Dr Paul Wehman As Dr Wehman has indicated expectations can include post secondary education supported employment in competitive sites and living with family or other residential places in the community In 2005 comprehensive health supports were described in National Goals for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities as universally available affordable and promoting inclusion as supporting wellinformed freely chose health care decisions culturally competent promoting health promotion and insuring well trained and respectful health care providers In addition mental health behavioral communication and crisis needs may need to be planned for and addressed Full inclusion – the idea that all children including those with severe disabilities can and should learn in a regular classroom has also taken root in many school systems and most notably in the province of New Brunswick Collaboration among the professions Inclusion settings allow children with and without disabilities to play and interact every day even when they are receiving therapeutic services When a child displays fine motor difficulty his ability to fully participate in common classroom activities such as cutting coloring and zipping a jacket may be hindered While occupational therapists are often called to assess and implement strategies outside of school it is frequently left up to classroom teachers to implement strategies in school Collaborating with occupational therapists will help classroom teachers use intervention strategies and increase teachers awareness about students needs within school settings and enhance teachers independence in implementation of occupational therapy strategies As a result of the 1997 reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act IDEA greater emphasis has been placed on delivery of related services within inclusive general education environments Nolan 2004 The importance of inclusive integrated models of service delivery for children with disabilities has been widely researched indicating positive benefits CaseSmith Holland 2009 In traditional pull out service delivery models children typically work in isolated settings one on one with a therapist CaseSmith and Holland2009 argue that children working on skills once or twice a week are less likely to produce learning that leads to new behaviors and increased competence Case Smith Holland 2009 pg419 In recent years occupational therapy has shifted from the conventional model of pull out therapy to an integrated model where the therapy takes place within a school or classroom Inclusion administrators have been requested to review their personnel to assure mental health personnel for children with mental health needs vocational rehabilitation linkages for work placements community linkages for special populations eg deafblind autism and collaboration among major community agencies for after school programs and transition to adulthood Highly recommended are collaborations with parents including parentprofessional partnerships in areas of cultural and linguistic diversity eg Syracuse Universitys special education PhDs Maya Kaylanpur and Beth Harry Selection of students for inclusion programs in schools Educators generally say that some students with special needs are not good candidates for inclusion Many schools expect a fully included student to be working at or near grade level but more fundamental requirements exist First being included requires that the student is able to attend school Students that are entirely excluded from school for example due to longterm hospitalization or who are educated outside of schools for example due to enrollment in a distance education program cannot attempt inclusion Additionally some students with special needs are poor candidates for inclusion because of their effect on other students For example students with severe behavioral problems such that they represent a serious physical danger to others are poor candidates for inclusion because the school has a duty to provide a safe environment to all students and staff Finally some students are not good candidates for inclusion because the normal activities in a general education classroom will prevent them from learning For example a student with severe attention difficulties or extreme sensory processing disorders might be highly distracted or distressed by the presence of other students working at their desks Inclusion needs to be appropriate to the childs unique needs Most students with special needs do not fall into these extreme categories as most students do attend school are not violent do not have severe sensory processing disorders etc The students that are most commonly included are those with physical disabilities that have no or little effect on their academic work diabetes mellitus epilepsy food allergies paralysis students with all types of mild disabilities and students whose disabilities require relatively few specialized services Bowe says that regular inclusion but not full inclusion is a reasonable approach for a significant majority of students with special needs He also says that for some students notably those with severe autism spectrum disorders or mental retardation as well as many who are deaf or have multiple disabilities even regular inclusion may not offer an appropriate education Teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes use antecedent procedures delayed contingencies selfmanagement strategies peermediated interventions pivotal response training and naturalistic teaching strategies Relationship to progressive education Some advocates of inclusion promote the adoption of progressive education practices In the progressive education or inclusive classroom everyone is exposed to a rich set of activities and each student does what he or she can do or what he or she wishes to do and learns whatever comes from that experience Maria Montessoris schools are sometimes named as an example of inclusive education Inclusion requires some changes in how teachers teach as well as changes in how students with and without special needs interact with and relate to one another Inclusive education practices frequently rely on active learning authentic assessment practices applied curriculum multilevel instructional approaches and increased attention to diverse student needs and individualization Arguments for full inclusion in regular neighborhood schools Advocates say that even partial noninclusion is morally unacceptable Proponents believe that noninclusion reduces the disabled students social importance and that maintaining their social visibility is more important than their academic achievement Proponents say that society accords disabled people less human dignity when they are less visible in general education classrooms Advocates say that even if typical students are harmed academically by the full inclusion of certain special needs students that the noninclusion of these students would still be morally unacceptable as advocates believe that the harm to typical students education is always less important than the social harm caused by making people with disabilities less visible in society A second key argument is that everybody benefits from inclusion Advocates say that there are many children and young people who dont fit in or feel as though they dont and that a school that fully includes all disabled students feels welcoming to all Moreover at least one author has studied the impact a diversified student body has on the general education population and has concluded that students with mental retardation who spend time among their peers show an increase in social skills and academic proficiency Advocates for inclusion say that the longterm effects of typical students who are included with special needs students at a very young age have a heightened sensitivity to the challenges that others face increased empathy and compassion and improved leadership skills which benefits all of society A combination of inclusion and pullout partial inclusion services has been shown to be beneficial to students with learning disabilities in the area of reading comprehension and preferential for the special education teachers delivering the services Inclusive education can be beneficial to all students in a class not just students with special needs Some research show that inclusion helps students understand the importance of working together and fosters a sense of tolerance and empathy among the student body Positive effects in regular classrooms There are many positive effects of inclusions where both the students with special needs along with the other students in the classroom both benefit Research has shown positive effects for children with disabilities in areas such as reaching individualized education program IEP goal improving communication and social skills increasing positive peer interactions many educational outcomes and post school adjustments Positive effects on children without disabilities include the development of positive attitudes and perceptions of persons with disabilities and the enhancement of social status with nondisabled peers Several studies have been done on the effects of inclusion of children with disabilities in general education classrooms A study on inclusion compared integrated and segregated special education only preschool students The study determined that children in the integrated sites progressed in social skills development while the segregated children actually regressed Another study shows the effect on inclusion in grades 2 to 5 The study determined that students with specific learning disabilities made some academic and affective gains at a pace comparable to that of normal achieving students Specific learning disabilities students also showed an improvement in selfesteem and in some cases improved motivation A third study shows how the support of peers in an inclusive classroom can lead to positive effects for children with autism The study observed typical inclusion classrooms ages ranging from 7 years old to 11 years old The peers were trained on an intervention technique to help their fellow autistic classmates stay on task and focused The study showed that using peers to intervene instead of classroom teachers helped students with autism reduce offtask behaviors significantly It also showed that the typical students accepted the student with autism both before and after the intervention techniques were introduced Criticisms of inclusion programs of school districts Critics of full and partial inclusion include educators administrators and parents Full and partial inclusion approaches neglect to acknowledge the fact most students with significant special needs require individualized instruction or highly controlled environments Thus general education classroom teachers often are teaching a curriculum while the special education teacher is remediating instruction at the same time Similarly a child with serious inattention problems may be unable to focus in a classroom that contains twenty or more active children Although with the increase of incidence of disabilities in the student population this is a circumstance all teachers must contend with and is not a direct result of inclusion as a concept Full inclusion may be a way for schools to placate parents and the general public using the word as a phrase to garner attention for what are in fact illusive efforts to educate students with special needs in the general education environment At least one study examined the lack of individualized services provided for students with IEPs when placed in an inclusive rather than mainstreamed environment Some researchers have maintained school districts neglect to prepare general education staff for students with special needs thus preventing any achievement Moreover school districts often expound an inclusive philosophy for political reasons and do away with any valuable pullout services all on behalf of the students who have no so say in the matter Inclusion is viewed by some as a practice philosophically attractive yet impractical Studies have not corroborated the proposed advantages of full or partial inclusion Moreover push in servicing does not allow students with moderate to severe disabilities individualized instruction in a resource room from which many show considerable benefit in both learning and emotional development Parents of disabled students may be cautious about placing their children in an inclusion program because of fears that the children will be ridiculed by other students or be unable to develop regular life skills in an academic classroom Some argue that inclusive schools are not a costeffective response when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions such as special education They argue that special education helps fix the special needs students by providing individualized and personalized instruction to meet their unique needs This is to help students with special needs adjust as quickly as possible to the mainstream of the school and community Proponents counter that students with special needs are not fully into the mainstream of student life because they are secluded to special education Some argue that isolating students with special needs may lower their selfesteem and may reduce their ability to deal with other people In keeping these students in separate classrooms they arent going to see the struggles and achievements that they can make together However at least one study indicated mainstreaming in education has longterm benefits for students as indicated by increased test scores where the benefit of inclusion has not yet been proved Broader approach social and cultural inclusion As used by UNESCO inclusion refers to far more than students with special educational needs It is centered on the inclusion of marginalized groups such as religious racial ethnic and linguistic minorities immigrants girls the poor students with disabilities HIVAIDS patients remote populations and more In some places these people are not actively included in education and learning processes In the US this broader definition is also known as culturally responsive education which differs from the 1980s1990s cultural diversity and cultural competency approaches and is promoted among the ten equity assistance centers of the US Department of Education for example in Region IX AZ CA NV by the Equity Alliance at ASU Gloria LadsonBillings points out that teachers who are culturally responsive know how to base learning experiences on the cultural realities of the child eg home life community experiences language background belief systems Proponents argue that culturally responsive pedagogy is good for all students because it builds a caring community where everyones experiences and abilities are valued Proponents want to maximize the participation of all learners in the community schools of their choice and to rethink and restructure policies curricula cultures and practices in schools and learning environments so that diverse learning needs can be met whatever the origin or nature of those needs They say that all students can learn and benefit from education and that schools should adapt to the physical social and cultural needs of students rather than students adapting to the needs of the school Proponents believe that individual differences between students are a source of richness and diversity which should be supported through a wide and flexible range of responses The challenge of rethinking and restructuring schools to become more culturally responsive calls for a complex systems view of the educational system egsee Michael Patton where one can extend the idea of strength through diversity to all participants in the educational system eg parents teachers community members staff Although inclusion is generally associated with elementary and secondary education it is also applicable in postsecondary education According to UNESCO inclusion is increasingly understood more broadly as a reform that supports and welcomes diversity amongst all learners Under this broader definition of inclusion steps should also be taken to eliminate discrimination and provide accommodations for all students who are at a disadvantage because of some reason other than disability Benefiting in an inclusive environment The inclusion of ageappropriate students in a general education classroom alongside those with and without disability is beneficial to both parties involved Waitoller and Thorius With inclusive education all students are exposed to the same curriculum they develop their own individual potential and participate in the same activities at the same time Therefore there is a variety of ways in which learning takes place because students learn differently at their own pace and by their own style Carter Moss Asmus Fesperman Cooney Brock Lyons Huber and Vincent Effectively inclusive education provides a nurturing venue where teaching and learning should occur despite pros and cons It is evident that students with disabilities benefit more in an inclusive atmosphere because they can receive help from their peers with diverse abilities and they compete at the same level due to equal opportunities given See also Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education Post Secondary Transition For High School Students with
