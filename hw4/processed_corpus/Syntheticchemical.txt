 Chemical synthesis is the purposeful execution of one or more named reactions to obtain a product or several products In modern laboratory usage this tends to imply that the process is reproducible reliable and established to work in multiple laboratories Introduction A chemical synthesisâ€”synthesis in its present meaning begins with the selection of chemical product target which often possesses academic industrial or therapeutic interest to the broader aims of the research effort Secondary practical concerns also come into play including researcher availability availability of material resources necessary equipment chemical building blocks and research budget A research grant proposal is often submitted to a funding agency such as National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health which describes the backgroundproposed synthesis and research plans and secondary concerns For instance a prior developed reaction methodology may highlight particular manmade or natural compounds that would serve the purposes of the effort in highlighting the breadth of the new methodology and possibly providing facile access to complex natural products Once the target or targets are established the next critical phase begins that of synthetic design typically in modern efforts in the area of organic synthesis using retrosynthetic analysis as championed by EJ Corey and others An eventual step is selection of compounds that are known as reagents or reactants Various reaction types can be applied to these to synthesize the product or an intermediate product This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel such as a chemical reactor or a simple roundbottom flask Many reactions require some form of workup procedure before the final product is isolated The isolation purification of the product then proceeds via a variety of methods The amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield Typically chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams in a laboratory setting or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that diminishes the yield of the desired product Strategies Many strategies exist in chemical synthesis that go beyond converting reactant A to reaction product B in a single step In multistep synthesis a chemical compound is synthesised though a series of individual chemical reactions each with their own workup For example a laboratory synthesis of paracetamol can consist of three individual synthetic steps In cascade reactions multiple chemical transformations take place within a single reactant in multicomponent reactions up to 11 different reactants form a single reaction product and in a telescopic synthesis one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolation of intermediates Organic synthesis Organic synthesis is a special branch of chemical synthesis dealing with the synthesis of organic compounds In the total synthesis of a complex product it may take multiple steps to synthesize the product of interest and inordinate amounts of time Skill in organic synthesis is prized among chemists and the synthesis of exceptionally valuable or difficult compounds has won chemists such as Robert Burns Woodward the Nobel Prize for Chemistry If a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new it is a purely synthetic process If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to new compounds the synthesis is described as a semisynthetic process Inorganic synthesis Tradition inorganic preparations Organometallic synthesis See also Beilstein database Chemical engineering Electrosynthesis Methods in Organic Synthesis Organic synthesis Peptide synthesis Total synthesis References External links The Organic Synthesis Archive Natural product syntheses
