Portaferry Up until about the 18th century the main body of the loch was better known by the older Irish name Loch Cuan meaning loch of the bayshavens This name was anglicized as Lough Coan Lough Cone Lough Coyn Lough Coin or similar The narrow channel may have been known in Latin as the fretum Brene In UlsterScots the lochs name is spelt Strangfurd or Strangﬁrt Loch Flora and fauna Flora Common cordgrass Spartina anglica CE Hubbard was introduced in the mid1940s is now abundant Maerl is a calcareous deposit in the main of two species of calcareous algae Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion glaciale which form freeliving beds of unattached branched corallines living or dead in Strangford Lough The rocky and boulder shores toward the south of the lough are dominated by the seaweed knotted wrack Ascophyllum nodosum The usual zonation of weeds on these shore is at the top channel wrack Pelvetia canaliculata L Dcne et Rhur followed by spiral wrack Fucus spiralis L then knotted wrack Ascophyllum nodosum L Le Jol with some admixture of bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus L and then serrated wrack Fucus serratus L before coming to the low water kelps A brown seaweed named Sargassum muticum originally from the Pacific Japan was discovered on 15 March 1995 in Strangford Lough at Paddys Point The plants were well established on mesh bags containing oysters The bags had been put out in 1987 containing Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas imported from Guernsey This Sargassum is known to be a highly invasive species Other algae include Apoglossum rusciofolium Turn J Ag

Animals commonly found in the lough include common seals basking sharks and brent geese Three quarters of the world population of pale bellied brent geese spend winter in the lough area The invasive carpet sea squirt Didemnum vexillum was found in the Lough in 2012 Tidal electricity In 2007 Strangford Lough became home to the worlds first commercial tidal stream power station SeaGen The 12 megawatt underwater tidal electricity generator part of Northern Irelands Environment and Renewable Energy Fund scheme takes advantage of the fast tidal flow in the lough which can be up to 4 ms Although the generator is powerful enough to power up to a thousand homes the turbine has a minimal environmental impact as it is almost entirely submerged and the rotors turn slowly enough that they pose no danger to wildlife Since June 2008 a tidal energy device called Evopod has been tested in Strangford Lough near the Portaferry Ferry landing The device is a 110 scale prototype and is being monitored by Queens University Belfast The device is a semi submerged floating tidal turbine and is moored to the seabed via a buoy mounted swivel so that it always maintains optimum heading into the direction of the tidal flow The scale device is not grid connected and dissipates the small amount of power it generates as heat into the sea Malik Priestley executive creator of SeaGen said tidal power will provide sustainable amounts of green renewable energy and pose no threats to surrounding wild life Activity on Strangford Lough Strangford Lough is a place of natural beauty that the locals put to great use From using it as a national highway PortaferryStrangford ferry to using it for activities of leisure sailing kayaking bird watching diving and much more There are a number of companies based in the local area encouraging visitors to explore the area including Exploris Aquarium where you can learn more about the lough and its wildlife Clearsky Adventure Centre kayaking canoeing etc and DV diving There are also canoe trails in place and a Strangford Lough Activity Map has been launched as a part of a series of maps produced by the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland In July 2016 the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership Scottish Coastal Rowing Association Newry Mourne and Down District Council and Ards and North Down Borough Council together with local rowing clubs based on Strangford Lough and the Ards Peninsula hosted the world community coastal rowing championships “Skiffie Worlds 2016” The event was attended by 50 clubs from Scotland England Northern Ireland the Netherlands The United States Canada and Tasmania Racing was held over a 2km course on Strangford Lough at Delamont Country Park Ferry There has been a ferry service between Portaferry and Strangford without a break for almost four centuries The alternative road journey is 47 miles and takes about an hour and a half while the ferry crosses the 06 nautical miles 069 mi in 8 minutes The subsidised public service operates at a loss of more than £1m per year but is viewed as an important transport link to the Ards Peninsula MV Portaferry 1 exCleddau King was bought from a company in Wales in 1975 after completion of the Cleddau Bridge She was modified by Harland and Wolff of Belfast and operated until sold in May 2002 MV Strangford was built by the Verolme Shipyard in Cork and launched on 6 September 1969 MV Portaferry II a £27 million vessel built by Gdańska Stocznia Remontowa and McTay Marine of Merseyside came into service on 18 December 2001 relegating MV Strangford to a support role Archaeology Strangford Lough has a substantial archaeological heritage Intertidal archaeological surveys in recent years have brought hundreds of sites to light including fish traps
