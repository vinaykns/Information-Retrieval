 A VRLA battery stands for valveregulated leadacid battery more commonly known as a sealed leadacid SLA gel cell or maintenance free battery is a type of leadacid rechargeable battery Due to their construction the Gel and Absorbed Glass Mat AGM types of VRLA can be mounted in any orientation and do not require constant maintenance The term maintenance free is a misnomer as VRLA batteries still require cleaning and regular functional testing They are widely used in large portable electrical devices offgrid power systems and similar roles where large amounts of storage are needed at a lower cost than other lowmaintenance technologies like lithiumion There are three primary types of VRLA batteries Sealed VR wet cell AGM and Gel Gel cells add silica dust to the electrolyte forming a thick puttylike gel These are sometimes referred to as silicone batteries AGM absorbed glass mat batteries feature fiberglass mesh between the battery plates which serves to contain the electrolyte Both designs offer advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional batteries and sealed VR wet cells as well as each other Basic principle Leadacid cells consist of two plates of lead which serve as electrodes suspended in diluted sulphuric acid which is then the electrolyte In conventional leadacid cells the diluted acid is in liquid form hence the term flooded or wet cells VRLA cells have essentially the same leadacid chemistry but the AGM and Gel types have the diluted acid electrolyte solution immobilized either by soaking a fiberglass mat in it hence glassmat batteries or by turning the liquid into a pastelike gel by the addition of silica and other gelling agents hence gel batteries The wet cell type contains acid in the liquid form similarly to the flooded lead acid batteries just the wet cell VRLA battery case is better sealed When a cell discharges the lead and diluted acid undergo a chemical reaction that produces lead sulphate and water see lead–acid battery for details of the chemical reaction When a cell is subsequently charged the lead sulphate and water are turned back into lead and acid In all leadacid battery designs charge current must be adjusted to match the ability of the battery to absorb the energy If the charging current is too great some of it will be wasted decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen in addition to the intended conversion of lead sulphate and water into lead dioxide lead and sulphuric acid which reverses the discharge process If these gases are allowed to escape as in a conventional flooded cell the battery may need to be topped up with water from time to time In contrast in VRLA batteries the gases are retained within the battery as long as the pressure remains within safe levels Under normal operating conditions the gases can then recombine within the battery itself sometimes with the help of a catalyst and no toppingup is needed1 However if the pressure exceeds safety limits safety valves open to allow the excess gases to escape and in doing so regulate the pressure back to safe levels hence valveregulated in VRLA In flooded leadacid batteries the liquid electrolyte is a hazard during shipping and makes them unsuitable for many portable applications Furthermore the need to maintain water levels makes them unsuitable for maintenancefree applications The immobilized electrolyte in VRLA batteries AGM and Gel types addresses these problems At the same time since VRLA cells cant be topped off with water any hydrogen lost during outgassing cant easily be replaced To some extent this can be compensated for by overprovisioning the quantity of electrolyte but at the cost of increased weight The main downside to the VRLA design is that the immobilizing agent also impedes the chemical reactions that generate current For this reason VRLAs have lower peak power ratings than conventional designs This makes them less useful for roles like car starting batteries where usage patterns are brief highcurrent pulses during starting followed by long slow recharging cycles VRLAs are mostly found in roles where the chargerecharge cycles are slower such as power storage applications Both flooded and VRLA designs require suitable ventilation around the batteries both to prevent hydrogen concentrations from building up hydrogen gas is highly flammable and to ensure that the batteries receive adequate cooling Construction VRLA cells may be made of flat plates similar to a conventional flooded lead–acid battery or may be made in a spiral roll form to make cylindrical cells VRLA batteries have a pressure relief valve which will activate when the battery starts building pressure of hydrogen gas generally a result of being recharged Valve activation allows some of the gas or electrolyte to escape thus decreasing the overall capacity of the battery Rectangular cells may have valves set to operate as low as 1 or 2 psi round spiral cells with metal external containers can have valves set as high as 40 psi The cell covers typically have gas diffuses built into them that allow safe dispersal of any excess hydrogen that may be formed during overcharge They are not permanently sealed but are designated to be maintenance free They can be oriented in any manner unlike normal lead–acid batteries which must be kept upright to avoid acid spills and to keep the plates orientation vertical Cells may be operated with the plates horizontal pancake style which may improve cycle life At high overcharge currents electrolysis of water occurs expelling hydrogen and oxygen gas through the batterys valves Care must be taken to prevent short circuits and rapid charging Constantvoltage charging is the usual most efficient and fastest charging method for VRLA batteries although other methods can be used VRLA batteries may be continually float charged at around 235 volts per cell at 25 °C Some designs can be fast charged 1 hour at high rates Sustained charging at 27 V per cell will damage the cells Constantcurrent overcharging at high rates rates faster than restoring the rated capacity in three hours will exceed the capacity of the cell to recombine hydrogen and oxygen History The first leadacid gel battery was invented by Elektrotechnische Fabrik Sonneberg in 1934 The modern gel or VRLA battery was invented by Otto Jache of Sonnenschein in 1957 The first AGM cell was the Cyclon patented by Gates Rubber Corporation in 1972 and now produced by Enersys The cyclon is a spiralwound cell with thin lead foil electrodes A number of manufacturers seized on the technology to implement it in cells with conventional flat plates In the mid1980s two UK companies Chloride and Tungstone simultaneously introduced 10 year life AGM batteries in capacities up to 400 Ah stimulated by a British Telecom specification for batteries for support of new digital exchanges In the same period Gates acquired another UK company Varley specialising in aircraft and military batteries Varley adapted the Cyclon lead foil technology to produce flat plate batteries with exceptional high rate output These gained approval for a variety of aircraft including the BAe 125 and 146 business jets the Harrier and its derivative the AV8B and some F16 variants as the first alternatives to the normal NiCd batteries Moves to higher capacity AGM batteries were led by GNBs Absolyte range extending to 3900 Ah VRLAAGM technology is now widespread in both stationary and vehicle batteries AGM Absorbent glass mat AGM batteries differ from flooded lead acid batteries in that the electrolyte is held in the glass mats as opposed to freely flooding the plates Very thin glass fibers are woven into a mat to increase surface area enough to hold sufficient electrolyte on the cells for their lifetime The fibers that compose the fine glass mat do not absorb nor are they affected by the acidic electrolyte These mats are wrung out 2–5 after being soaked in acids prior to manufacture completion and sealing The plates in an AGM battery may be any shape Some are flat others are bent or rolled AGM batteries both deep cycle and starting are built in a rectangular case to BCI battery code specifications Gel battery Originally a kind of gel cell was produced in the early 1930s for portable valve tube radio LT supply 2 4 or 6V by adding silica to the sulfuric acid By this time the glass case was being replaced by celluloid and later in 1930s other plastics Earlier wet cells in glass jars used special valves to allow tilt from vertical to one horizontal direction in 1927 to 1931 or 1932 The gel cells were less likely to leak when the portable set was handled roughly A modern gel battery also known as a gel cell is a VRLA battery with a gelified electrolyte the sulfuric acid is mixed with fumed silica which makes the resulting mass gellike and immobile Unlike a flooded wetcell leadacid battery these batteries do not need to be kept upright Gel batteries reduce the electrolyte evaporation spillage and subsequent corrosion problems common to the wetcell battery and boast greater resistance to shock and vibration Chemically they are almost the same as wet nonsealed batteries except that the antimony in the lead plates is replaced by calcium and gas recombination can take place The modern gel formulation and large scale production was from Otto Jaches and Heinz Schroeders US Patent 4414302 assigned to the German company Accumulatorenfabrik Sonnenschein GmbH With gel electrolyte the separator was no longer such a critical hardtomake component and cycle life was increased in some cases dramatically Shedding of active material from the plates was reduced More importantly gas recombination was used to make batteries that were not watered and could be called maintenancefree The oneway valves were set at 2 psi and this was high enough for full recombination to take place At the end of charge when oxygen was evolved from overcharge on the positive plate it traveled through the shrinkage cracks in the gel directly to the negative plate made from high surface area pure sponge lead and burned up as fast as it was made This oxygen gas and the hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of the sponge lead metal negative plate combined to make water that was retained in the cell This sealed nonspill feature made it possible to make very small VRLA batteries 1 –12 Amp hr range that fit into the growing portable electronics market A large market for inexpensive smaller sealed lead acid batteries was generated quickly Portable TV light for news cameras childrens toy riding cars emergency lighting and UPS systems for computer backup to name a few were powered with small sealed VRLA batteries Applications Many modern motorcycles and ATVs on the market use AGM batteries to reduce likelihood of acid spilling during cornering vibration or after accidents and for packaging reasons The lighter smaller battery can be installed at an odd angle if needed for the design of the motorcycle Due to the higher manufacturing costs compared with flooded lead–acid batteries AGM batteries are currently used on luxury vehicles As vehicles become heavier and equipped with more electronic devices such as navigation and stability control AGM batteries are being employed to lower vehicle weight and provide better electrical reliability compared with flooded lead–acid batteries 5 series BMWs from March 2007 incorporate AGM batteries in conjunction with devices for recovering brake energy using regenerative braking and computer control to ensure the alternator charges the battery when the car is decelerating Vehicles used in auto racing may use AGM batteries due to their vibration resistance Deepcycle AGMs are also commonly used in off grid solar power and wind power installations as an energy storage bank and in largescale amateur robotics such as the FIRST and IGVC competitions AGM batteries are routinely chosen for remote sensors such as ice monitoring stations in the Arctic AGM batteries due to their lack of free electrolyte will not crack and leak in these cold environments VRLA batteries are used extensively in power wheelchairs as the extremely low gas and acid output makes them much safer for indoor use VRLA batteries are also used in the UPS uninterruptible power supply as a back up when the electrical power goes off VRLA batteries are also the standard power source in sailplanes due to their ability to withstand a variety of flight attitudes and a relatively large ambient temperature range with no adverse effects However charging regimes must be adapted with varying temperature Both AGM and Gel cells are commonly used in powered aerobatic aircraft for the same reasons VRLA batteries are used in the US Nuclear Submarine fleet due to their power density elimination of gassing reduced maintenance and enhanced safety AGM and Gelcell batteries are also used for recreational marine purposes with AGM being more commonly available AGM deepcycle marine batteries are offered by a number of suppliers They typically are favored for their low maintenance and spillproof quality although generally considered a less cost effective solution relative to traditional flooded cells In telecommunications applications VRLA batteries that comply with criteria in Telcordia Technologies requirements document GR4228 ValveRegulated LeadAcid VRLA Battery String Certification Levels Based on Requirements for Safety and Performance are recommended for deployment in the Outside Plant OSP at locations such as Controlled Environmental Vaults CEVs Electronic Equipment Enclosures EEEs and huts and in uncontrolled structures such as cabinets Relative to VRLA in telecommunications the use of VRLA Ohmic Measurement Type Equipment OMTE and OMTElike measurement equipment is a fairly new process to evaluate telecommunications battery plants The proper use of ohmic test equipment allows battery testing without the need to remove batteries from service to perform costly and timeconsuming discharge tests Comparison with flooded lead–acid cells VRLA Gel and AGM batteries offer several advantages compared with VRLA flooded lead acid and conventional standard leadacid batteries The battery can be mounted in any position since the valves only operate on overpressure faults Since the battery system is designed to be recombinant and eliminate the emission of gases on overcharge room ventilation requirements are reduced and no acid fume is emitted during normal operation Flooded cell gas emissions are of little consequence in all but the smallest confined areas and pose very little threat to a domestic user so a wet cell battery designed for longevity gives lower costs per kWh In a gel battery the volume of free electrolyte that could be released on damage to the case or venting is very small There is no need or ability to check the level of electrolyte or to top up water lost due to electrolysis reducing inspection and maintenance requirements Wet cell batteries can be maintained by a selfwatering system or by topping up every three months The requirement to add distilled water is normally caused by overcharging A wellregulated system should not require topup more often than every three months The underlying fault with all lead acid batteries is the requirement for an excessively long charge time arising from a twostage process bulk charge and float charge All lead acid batteries irrespective of type are quick to charge to 70 of capacity within 2 or 3 hours but require another 9 to 10 hours to float charge after the initial charge If users fail to float charge battery capacity is dramatically reduced All types of batteries have a memory in that every time a user charges to less than 100 charge battery capacity is shortened A lead acid battery could reach 4600 cycles if it were kept on a shelf and kept at the right state of charge To ensure a life of 8 years a lead acid battery should be kept at full charge when stored or dry and when working kept at depth of discharge of less than 20 In addition its discharge rate should be not more than three hours and its charge rate should be not more than three hours C0333 and it should be float charged properly With less careful use a lifetime of two to three years or 700800 cycles might be expected dependent upon the use environment Because of calcium added to its plates to reduce water loss a sealed AGM or gel battery recharges more quickly than a flooded lead acid battery of either VRLA or conventional design From a standard car 4WD or truck alternator they will recharge quickly from full use in about 2 to 3 hours A deep cycle wet cell battery can take 812 hours to achieve only 70 to 80 of its potential charge Compared to flooded batteries VRLA batteries are more vulnerable to thermal runaway during abusive charging The electrolyte cannot be tested by hydrometer to diagnose improper charging that can reduce battery life AGM automobile batteries are typically about twice the price of floodedcell batteries in a given BCI size group gel batteries as much as five times the price AGM Gel VRLA batteries Have shorter recharge time than flooded leadacid Cannot tolerate overcharging overcharging leads to premature failure Have shorter useful life compared to properly maintained wetcell battery Discharge significantly less hydrogen gas AGM batteries are by nature safer for the environment and safer to use Can be used or positioned in any orientation See also Gaston Planté
