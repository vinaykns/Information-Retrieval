 See also Solar panels on spacecraft Spacebased solar power SBSP is the concept of collecting solar power in outer space and distributing it to Earth using a solarpower satellite or a solarpower system It has been in research since the early 1970s SBSP would differ from current solar collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on Earths surface Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere and night time in space Part of the solar energy 55–60 is lost on its way through the atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption Spacebased solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere avoiding these losses and the downtime and cosine losses for fixed flatplate collectors due to the Earths rotation Besides the cost of implementing such a system SBSP also introduces several new hurdles primarily the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earths surface for use Since wires extending from Earths surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology SBSP designs generally include the use of some manner of wireless power transmission The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter and focus its beam toward a collector rectenna on Earths surface Radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become concerns for SBSP SBSP is considered a form of sustainable or green energy renewable energy and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals It is attractive to those seeking largescale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion such as peak oil SBSP is being actively pursued by Japan and China In 2008 Japan passed its Basic Space Law which established Space Solar Power as a national goal and JAXA has a roadmap to commercial SBSP In 2015 the China Academy for Space Technology CAST briefed their roadmap at the International Space Development Conference ISDC where they showcased their road map to a 1 GW commercial system in 2050 and unveiled a video and description of their design A proposal for the United States to lead in Space Solar Power has recently received high level attention after it won the D3 Diplomacy Development Defense competition sponsored by the Secretary of Defense Secretary of State and USAID Director As of May 21 2015 there was an active petition on Changeorg and a second active petition at Whitehouse website History The National Space Society maintains an extensive Space Solar Power Library of all major historical documents and studies associated with space solar power and major news articles In 1941 science fiction writer Isaac Asimov published the science fiction short story Reason in which a space station transmits energy collected from the Sun to various planets using microwave beams The SBSP concept originally known as satellite solarpower system SSPS was first described in November 1968 In 1973 Peter Glaser was granted US patent number 3781647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances eg from an SPS to Earths surface using microwaves from a very large antenna up to one square kilometer on the satellite to a much larger one now known as a rectenna on the ground Glaser then was a vice president at Arthur D Little Inc NASA signed a contract with ADL to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974 They found that while the concept had several major problems – chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space – it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research Between 1978 and 1986 the Congress authorized the Department of Energy DoE and NASA to jointly investigate the concept They organized the Satellite Power System Concept Development and Evaluation Program The study remains the most extensive performed to date budget 50 million Several reports were published investigating the engineering feasibility of such an engineering project They include Resource Requirements Critical Materials Energy and Land FinancialManagement Scenarios Public Acceptance State and Local Regulations as Applied to Satellite Power System Microwave Receiving Antenna Facilities Student Participation Potential of Laser for SBSP Power Transmission International Agreements CentralizationDecentralization Mapping of Exclusion Areas For Rectenna Sites Economic and Demographic Issues Related to Deployment Some Questions and Answers Meteorological Effects on Laser Beam Propagation and Direct Solar Pumped Lasers Public Outreach Experiment Power Transmission and Reception Technical Summary and Assessment Space Transportation Discontinuation The project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 US Federal elections The Office of Technology Assessment concluded that Too little is currently known about the technical economic and environmental aspects of SPS to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment In addition without further research an SPS demonstration or systemsengineering verification program would be a highrisk venture In 1997 NASA conducted its Fresh Look study to examine the modern state of SBSP feasibility In assessing What has changed since the DOE study NASA asserted that the US National Space Policy now calls for NASA to make significant investments in technology not a particular vehicle to drive the costs of ETO Earth to Orbit transportation down dramatically This is of course an absolute requirement of space solar power Conversely Dr Pete Worden claimed that spacebased solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the Arizona desert with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit Dr Worden referred to possible solutions as speculative and that would not be available for decades at the earliest On Nov 2 2012 China proposed space collaboration with India that mentioned SBSP may be Spacebased Solar Power initiative so that both India and China can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program Main article Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program In 1999 NASAs Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program SERT was initiated for the following purposes Perform design studies of selected flight demonstration concepts Evaluate studies of the general feasibility design and requirements Create conceptual designs of subsystems that make use of advanced SSP technologies to benefit future space or terrestrial applications Formulate a preliminary plan of action for the US working with international partners to undertake an aggressive technology initiative Construct technology development and demonstration roadmaps for critical Space Solar Power SSP elements SERT went about developing a solar power satellite SPS concept for a future gigawatt space power system to provide electrical power by converting the Suns energy and beaming it to Earths surface and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies SERT proposed an inflatable photovoltaic gossamer structure with concentrator lenses or solar heat engines to convert sunlight into electricity The program looked both at systems in sunsynchronous orbit and geosynchronous orbit Some of SERTs conclusions The increasing global energy demand is likely to continue for many decades resulting in new power plants of all sizes being built The environmental impact of those plants and their impact on world energy supplies and geopolitical relationships can be problematic Renewable energy is a compelling approach both philosophically and in engineering terms Many renewable energy sources are limited in their ability to affordably provide the base load power required for global industrial development and prosperity because of inherent land and water requirements Based on their Concept Definition Study space solar power concepts may be ready to reenter the discussion Solar power satellites should no longer be envisioned as requiring unimaginably large initial investments in fixed infrastructure before the emplacement of productive power plants can begin Space solar power systems appear to possess many significant environmental advantages when compared to alternative approaches The economic viability of space solar power systems depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies not least of which is the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available however the same can be said of many other advanced power technologies options Space solar power may well emerge as a serious candidate among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century Space Solar Power Satellite Technology Development at the Glenn Research Center—An Overview James E Dudenhoefer and Patrick J George NASA Glenn Research Center Cleveland Ohio Launch costs in the range of 100–200 per kilogram of payload to low Earth orbit are needed if SPS are to be economically viable Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency The May 2014 IEEE Spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article Its Always Sunny in Space by Dr Susumu Sasaki The article stated Its been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of scifi for decades but spacebased solar power could at last become a reality—and within 25 years according to a proposal from researchers at the Tokyobased Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA JAXA announced on 12 March 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 18 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity This is the standard plan for this type of power On 12 March 2015 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts kW of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters m away Challenges Potential The SBSP concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the Earths surface for the collection of solar power Its always solar noon in space and full sun Collecting surfaces could receive much more intense sunlight owing to the lack of obstructions such as atmospheric gasses clouds dust and other weather events Consequently the intensity in orbit is approximately 144 of the maximum attainable intensity on Earths surface A satellite could be illuminated over 99 of the time and be in Earths shadow a maximum of only 72 minutes per night at the spring and fall equinoxes at local midnight Orbiting satellites can be exposed to a consistently high degree of solar radiation generally for 24 hours per day whereas the average earth surface solar panels currently collect power for an average of 29 per day Power could be relatively quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most A collecting satellite could possibly direct power on demand to different surface locations based on geographical baseload or peak load power needs Typical contracts would be for baseload continuous power since peaking power is ephemeral Elimination of plant and wildlife interference With very large scale implementations especially at lower altitudes it potentially can reduce incoming solar radiation reaching earths surface This would be desirable for counteracting the effects of global warming Drawbacks The SBSP concept also has a number of problems The large cost of launching a satellite into space Inaccessibility Maintenance of an earthbased solar panel is relatively simple but construction and maintenance on a solar panel in space would typically be done telerobotically In addition to cost astronauts working in GEO orbit are exposed to unacceptably high radiation dangers and risk and cost about one thousand times more than the same task done telerobotically The space environment is hostile panels suffer about 8 times the degradation they would on Earth except at orbits that are protected by the magnetosphere Space debris is a major hazard to large objects in space and all large structures such as SBSP systems have been mentioned as potential sources of orbital debris The broadcast frequency of the microwave downlink if used would require isolating the SBSP systems away from other satellites GEO space is already well used and it is considered unlikely the ITU would allow an SPS to be launched The large size and corresponding cost of the receiving station on the ground Energy losses during several phases of conversion from photon to electron to photon back to electron as Elon Musk has stated Design Spacebased solar power essentially consists of three elements collecting solar energy in space with reflectors or inflatable mirrors onto solar cells wireless power transmission to Earth via microwave or laser receiving power on Earth via a rectenna a microwave antenna The spacebased portion will not need to support itself against gravity other than relatively weak tidal stresses It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather but will have to cope with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares Two basic methods of conversion have been studied photovoltaic PV and solar dynamic SD Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earths surface using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies There is an annual International SunSat design competition hosted by Ohio University Microwave power transmission William C Brown demonstrated in 1964 during Walter Cronkites CBS News program a microwavepowered model helicopter that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam Between 1969 and 1975 Bill Brown was technical director of a JPL Raytheon program that beamed 30 kW of power over a distance of 1 mile 16 km at 84 efficiency Microwave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at Goldstone in California 1975 and Grand Bassin on Reunion Island 1997 More recently microwave power transmission has been demonstrated in conjunction with solar energy capture between a mountain top in Maui and the island of Hawaii 92 miles away by a team under John C Mankins Technological challenges in terms of array layout single radiation element design and overall efficiency as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research as it is demonstrated by the Special Session on Analysis of Electromagnetic Wireless Systems for Solar Power Transmission to be held in the 2010 IEEE Symposium on Antennas and Propagation In 2013 a useful overview was published covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground It includes an introduction to SPS current research and future prospects Moreover a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the Proceedings of the IEEE Laser power beaming Laser power beaming was envisioned by some at NASA as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space In the 1980s researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for spacetospace power beaming focusing primarily on the development of a solarpowered laser In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space In 1991 the SELENE project SpacE Laser ENErgy had begun which included the study of laser power beaming for supplying power to a lunar base The SELENE program was a twoyear research effort but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a spacebased demonstration In 1988 the use of an Earthbased laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by Grant Logan with technical details worked out in 1989 He proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees to convert ultraviolet laser light Orbital location The main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler Another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit other spacebased power stations have much longer startup times before they are producing nearly continuous power A collection of LEO Low Earth Orbit space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO Geostationary Orbit spacebased solar power Earthbased receiver The Earthbased rectenna would likely consist of many short dipole antennas connected via diodes Microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85 efficiency With a conventional microwave antenna the reception efficiency is better but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater Rectennas would likely be several kilometers across In space applications A laser SBSP could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the Moon or Mars saving on mass costs to land the power source A spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means In a 2012 report presented to NASA on Space Solar Power the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind Space Solar Power could be for Solar Electric Propulsion Systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions Launch costs One problem for the SBSP concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched Reusable launch systems are predicted to provide lower launch costs to low Earth orbit LEO As of November 2013 one company SpaceX is two years along on a privately funded multiyear development program for a reusable rocket launching system with the stated intention to commercialize fully and rapidly reusable launch technology SpaceX has completed eight test flights of their lowaltitude booster return prototype Grasshopper and one test flight of a highaltitudehighvelocity booster return test vehicle with a second booster return test flight planned for early 2014 Much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately which raises the possibility that high efficiency but slower engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required optical aperture sizes are very large For example the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1km diameter transmitting antenna and a 10 km diameter receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at 245 GHz These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets Because of the thinned array curse it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high small SPS systems will be possible but uneconomic To give an idea of the scale of the problem assuming a solar panel mass of 20 kg per kilowatt without considering the mass of the supporting structure antenna or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80000 metric tons all of which would in current circumstances be launched from the Earth Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1 kgkW meaning 4000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavylift launch vehicle HLLV launches to send the material to low earth orbit where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays which then could use highefficiency ionengine style rockets to slowly reach GEO Geostationary orbit With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttlebased HLLVs of 500 million to 800 million and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at 78 million total launch costs would range between 11 billion low cost HLLV low weight panels and 320 billion expensive HLLV heavier panels To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions if such costs are to be used in comparison to earthbased energy production For comparison the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from 3 billion to 6 billion per GW not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel respectively another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of 24 billion 1970s dollars taking inflation into account would cost 140 billion today more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station However in 2013 based on Recent innovations Electric Space SpaceBased Solar Power Technologies Applications suggested a new way to reduce costs by replacing smaller satellites and in lower Orbits Building from space From lunar materials launched in orbit Gerard ONeill noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s proposed building the SPSs in orbit with materials from the Moon Launch costs from the Moon are potentially much lower than from Earth due to the lower gravity and lack of atmospheric drag This 1970s proposal assumed the thenadvertised future launch costing of NASAs space shuttle This approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish mass drivers on the Moon Nevertheless on 30 April 1979 the Final Report Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction by General Dynamics Convair Division under NASA contract NAS915560 concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than Earthbased materials for a system of as few as thirty Solar Power Satellites of 10GW capacity each In 1980 when it became obvious NASAs launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic ONeill et al published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs This 1980s SPS concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially selfreplicating systems on the lunar surface under remote control of workers stationed on Earth The high net energy gain of this proposal derives from the Moons much shallower gravitational well Having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of SPS being built The low cost per pound of lunar materials in ONeills vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites Advanced techniques for launching from the Moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials Some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the lunar space elevator first described by Jerome Pearson It would require establishing silicon mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the Moon On the Moon David Criswell suggests the Moon is the optimum location for solar power stations and promotes lunar solar power The main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials using insitu resource utilization with a teleoperated mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to SBSP designs Power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the Moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project A demo project of 1 GW starts at 50 billion The Shimizu Corporation use combination of lasers and microwave for the lunar ring concept along with power relay satellites From an asteroid Asteroid mining has also been seriously considered A NASA design study evaluated a 10000 ton mining vehicle to be assembled in orbit that would return a 500000 ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit Only about 3000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospacegrade payload The rest would be reaction mass for the massdriver engine which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload Assuming that 100 of the returned asteroid was useful and that the asteroid miner itself couldnt be reused that represents nearly a 95 reduction in launch costs However the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids thus far we have only estimates of their composition One proposal is to capture the asteroid Apophis into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 GW each or the larger asteroid 1999 AN10 which is 50x the size of Apophis and large enough to build 7500 5Gigawatt Solar Power Satellites Gallery A Lunar base with a mass driver the long structure that goes

cells on the surface of the Moon Shown here is an array of solar collectors that convert power into microwave beams directed toward Earth A solar power satellite built from a mined asteroid Counter arguments Safety The use of microwave transmission of power has been the most controversial issue in considering any SPS design At the Earths surface a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center of 23 mWcm less than 14 the solar irradiation constant and an intensity of less than 1 mWcm outside the rectenna fenceline the receivers perimeter These compare with current United States Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA workplace exposure limits for microwaves which are 10 mWcm the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for Federal OSHA enforcement purposes A beam of this intensity is therefore at its center of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels even for long term or indefinite exposure Outside the receiver it is far less than the OSHA longterm levels Over 95 of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna The remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world It is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna Outside the rectenna microwave intensities rapidly decrease so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected Exposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways On the ground physical access is controllable eg via fencing and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell ie a Faraday Cage which will intercept the microwaves Other aircraft balloons ultralight etc can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace The microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system simply the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels even in principle In addition a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife particularly birds Experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations Suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore but this presents serious problems including corrosion mechanical stresses and biological contamination A commonly proposed approach to ensuring failsafe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective phased array antennarectenna A pilot microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna There circuits in each of the antennas subarrays compare the pilot beams phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity if the pilot beam is lost for any reason if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna for example the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter The longterm effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect Timeline In the 20th century 1941 Isaac Asimov published the science fiction short story Reason in which a space station transmits energy collected from the sun to various planets using microwave beams 1968 Dr Peter Glaser introduces the concept of a solar power satellite system with square miles of solar collectors in

lays out potential paths for achieving all needed advances — albeit over several decades In the 21st century 2001 Dr Neville Marzwell of NASA states We now have the technology to convert the suns energy at the rate of 42 to 56 percent We have made tremendous progress If you can concentrate the suns rays through the use of large mirrors or lenses you get more for your money because most of the cost is in the PV arrays There is a risk element but you can reduce it You can put these small receivers in the desert or in the mountains away from populated areas We believe that in 15 to 25 years we can lower that cost to 7 to 10 cents per kilowatt hour We offer an advantage You dont need cables pipes gas or copper wires We can send it to you like a cell phone call—where you want it and when

proposed reusable space launch system 1 The paper makes a case that up to 2 TWyear of power satellites could be constructed without intolerable damage to the atmosphere Before this paper there was concern that the NOx produced by reentry would destroy too much ozone Nontypical configurations and architectural considerations The typical reference systemofsystems involves a significant number several thousand multigigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of Earths energy requirements of individual satellites in GEO The typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 110 GW range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltics PV as the energy collector conversion The most typical transmission designs are in the 1–10 GHz 245 or 58 GHz RF band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere Materials for the satellites are sourced from and manufactured on Earth and expected to be transported to LEO via reusable rocket launch and transported between LEO and GEO via chemical or electrical propulsion In summary the architecture choices are Location GEO Energy Collection PV Satellite Monolithic Structure Transmission RF Materials Manufacturing Earth Installation RLVs to LEO Chemical to GEO There are several interesting design variants from the reference system Alternate energy collection location While GEO is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to Earth simplified pointing and tracking very small time in occultation and scalability to meet all global demand several times over other locations have been proposed Sun Earth L1 Robert Kennedy III Ken Roy David Fields have proposed a variant of the L1 sunshade called Dyson Dot s where a multiterrawatt primary collector would beam energy back to a series of LEO sunsynchronous receiver satellites The much farther distance to Earth requires a correspondingly larger transmission aperture Lunar Surface Dr David Criswell has proposed using the Lunar surface itself as the collection medium beaming power to the ground via a series of microwave reflectors in Earth Orbit The chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors insitu without the energy cost and complexity of launch Disadvantages include the much longer distance requiring larger transmission systems the required overbuild to deal with the lunar night and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites MEO MEO systems have been proposed for inspace utilities and beampower propulsion infrastructures For example see Royce Jones paper Highly Elliptical Orbits Molniya Tundra or Quazi Zenith orbits have been proposed as early locations for niche markets requiring less energy to access and providing good persistence For example see Kevin Reeds QGSO proposal Slide 25 SunSync LEO In this near Polar Orbit the satellites precess at a rate that allows them to always face the Sun as they rotate around Earth This is an easy to access orbit requiring far less energy and its proximity to Earth requires smaller and therefore less massive transmitting apertures However disadvantages to this approach include having to constantly shift receiving stations or storing energy for a burst transmission This orbit is already crowded and has significant space debris Equatorial LEO Japans SPS 2000 proposed an early demonstrator in equatorial LEO in which multiple equatorial participating nations could receive some power Earths Surface Dr Narayan Komerath has proposed a space power grid where excess energy from an existing grid or power plant on one side of the planet can be passed up to orbit across to another satellite and down to receivers Energy Collection The most typical designs for Solar Power Satellites include photovoltaics These may be planar and usually passively cooled concentrated and perhaps actively cooled However there are multiple interesting variants Solar Thermal Proponents of Solar Thermal have proposed using concentrated heating to cause a state change in a fluid to extract energy via rotating machinery followed by cooling in radiators Advantages of this method might include overall system mass disputed nondegradation due to solarwind damage and radiation tolerance One recent thermal solar power satellite design by Keith Henson has been visualized here Solar Pumped Laser Japan has pursued a solarpumped laser where sunlight directly excites the lasing medium used to create the coherent beam to Earth Fusion Decay This version of a powersatellite is not solar Rather the vacuum of space is seen as a feature not a bug for traditional fusion Per Dr Paul Werbos after fusion even neutral particles decay to charged particles which in a sufficiently large volume would allow direct conversion to current Solar Wind Loop Also called a DysonHaroop satellite Here the satellite makes use not of the photons from the Sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via electromagnetic coupling generate a current in a large loop Direct Mirrors Early concepts for direct mirror redirection of light to planet Earth suffered from the problem that rays coming from the sun are not parallel but are expanding from a disk and so the size of the spot on the Earth is quite large Dr Lewis Fraas has explored an array of parbolic mirrors to augment existing solar arrays Alternate Satellite Architecture The typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss one or more collectors one or more transmitters and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors The entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized Alternative designs include Swarms of Smaller Satellites Some designs propose swarms of freeflying smaller satellites This is the case with several laser designs and appears to be the case with CALTECHs Flying Carpets For RF designs an engineering constraint is the sparse array problem Free Floating Components Solaren has proposed an alternative to the monolithic structure where the primary reflector and transmission reflector are freeflying Spin Stabilization NASA explored a spinstabilized thin film concept Photonic Laser Thruster PLT stabilized structure Dr Young Bae has proposed that photon pressure may substitute for compressive members in large structures Transmission The most typical design for energy transmission is via an RF antenna at below 10 GHz to a rectenna on the ground Controversy exists between the benefits of Klystrons Gyrotrons Magnetrons and solid state Alternate transmission approaches include Laser Lasers offer the advantage of much lower cost and mass to first power however there is controversy regarding benefits of efficiency Lasers allow for much smaller transmitting and receiving apertures However a highly concentrated beam has eyesafety fire safety and weaponization concerns Proponents believe they have answers to all these concerns A laserbased approach must also find alternate ways of coping with precipitation Atmospheric Waveguide Some have proposed it may be possible to use a short pulse laser to create an atmospheric waveguide through which concentrated microwaves could flow2 Scalar Some have even speculated it may be possible to transmit power through scalar waves Materials and Manufacturing Typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on Earth and use Earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant Variants include Lunar Materials Designs exist for Solar Power Satellites that source 99 of materials from lunar regolith with very small inputs of vitamins from other locations Using materials from the Moon is attractive because launch from the Moon is in theory far less complicated than from Earth There is no atmosphere and so components do not need to be packed tightly in an aeroshell and survive vibration pressure and temperature loads Launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely Launch from the Moon the GEO also requires far less energy than from Earths much deeper gravity well Building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the Moon SelfReplication on the Moon NASA explored a selfreplicating factory on the Moon in 1980 More recently Justin LewisWebber proposed a method of speciated manufacture of core elements based upon John Mankins SPSAlpha design Asteroidal Materials Some asteroids are thought to have even lower DeltaV to recover materials than the Moon and some particular materials of interest such as metals may be more concentrated or easier to access InSpaceInSitu Manufacturing With the advent of inspace additive manufacturing concepts such as SpiderFab might allow mass launch of raw materials for local extrusion Method of Installation Transportation of Material to Energy Collection Location In the reference designs component material is launched via wellunderstood chemical rockets usually fully reusable launch systems to LEO after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to GEO The desired characteristics for this system is very high massflow at low total cost Alternate concepts include Lunar Chemical Launch ULA has recently showcased a concept for a fully reusable chemical lander XEUS to move materials from the Lunar surface to LLO or GEO Lunar Mass Driver Launch of materials from the lunar surface using a system similar to an aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult An unexplored compact alternative would be the slingatron Lunar Space Elevator An equatorial or nearequatorial cable extends to and through the lagrange point This is claimed by proponents to be lower in mass than a traditional mass driver Space Elevator A ribbon of pure carbon nanotubes extends from its center of gravity in Geostationary orbit allowing climbers to climb up to GEO Problems with this include the material challenge of creating a ribbon of such length with adequate strength management of collisions with satellites and space debris and lightning MEO Skyhook As part of an AFRL study Roger Lenard proposed a MEO Skyhook It appears that a gravity gradientstabilized tether with its center of mass in MEO can be constructed of available materials The bottom of the skyhook is close to the atmosphere in a nonkeplerian orbit A reusable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a nonkeplerian orbit travelling much slower than typical orbital speed The payload is transferred and it climbs the cable The cable itself is kept from deorbiting via electric propusion andor electromagnetic effects MAGLEV Launch StarTram John Powell has a concept for a very high massflow system In a firstgen system built into a mountain accelerates a payload through an evacuated MAGLEV track A small onboard rocket circulizes the payload Beamed Energy Launch Kevin Parkin and Escape Dynamics both have concepts for groundbased irradiation of a monopropellant launch vehicle using RF energy The RF energy is absorbed and directly heats the propellant not unlike in NERVAstyle nuclearthermal LaserMotive has a concept for a laserbased approach In fiction Space stations transmitting solar power have appeared in sciencefiction works like Isaac Asimovs Reason 1941 that centers around the troubles caused by the robots operating the station Asimovs short story The Last Question also features the use of SBSP to provide limitless energy for use on Earth Ben Bovas thriller PowerSat involves a billionaire bent on creating a solar powersat while others try to sabotage it In the video game Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri the player can construct a city improvement called an Orbital Power Transmitter which while expensive provides energy to all other cities Constructing many of these results in huge bonuses to energy production for all cities the player owns In the novel Skyfall 1976 by Harry Harrison an attempt to launch the core of powersat from Cape Canaveral ends in disaster when the launch vehicle fails trapping the payload in a decaying orbit Several SimCity games have featured spacemicrowave power plants as buildable options for municipal energy along with unrealistic disaster scenarios where the beam strays off the collector and sets fire to nearby areas In the manga and anime Mobile Suit Gundam 00 an orbital ring containing multiple solar collectors and microwave transmitters along with power stations and space elevators for carrying power back down to Earths surface are the primary source of electricity for the Earth in the 24th century Various aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos including the Boeing You Just Wait Lockheed Martins The Next 100 Years and United Launch Alliance CISLunar 1000 See
