 Accumulation of capital redirects here For the book by Rosa Luxemburg see The Accumulation of Capital Capitalbuilding redirects here For the headquarters of the European External Action Service see Triangle building Capital accumulation also termed the accumulation of capital is the dynamic that motivates the pursuit of profit involving the investment of money or any financial asset with the goal of increasing the initial monetary value of said asset as a financial return whether in the form of profit rent interest royalties or capital gains The process of capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism and is one of the defining characteristics of a capitalist economic system In a more broad sense capital accumulation may refer to the gathering or amassing of any objects of value as judged by ones perceived reproductive interest group Definition The definition of capital accumulation is subject to controversy and ambiguities because it could refer to a net addition to existing wealth a redistribution of wealth Most often capital accumulation involves both a net addition and a redistribution of wealth which may raise the question of who really benefits from it most If more wealth is produced than there was before a society becomes richer the total stock of wealth increases But if some accumulate capital only at the expense of others wealth is merely shifted from A to B It is also possible that some accumulate capital much faster than others In principle it is possible that a few people or organisations accumulate capital and grow richer although the total stock of wealth of society decreases In economics and accounting capital accumulation is often equated with investment of profit income or savings especially in real capital goods The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation see below Capital accumulation refers ordinarily to real investment in tangible means of production such as acquisitions research and development etc that can increase the capital flow investment in financial assets represented on paper yielding profit interest rent royalties fees or capital gains investment in nonproductive physical assets such as residential real estate or works of art that appreciate in value and by extension to human capital ie new education and training increasing the skills of the potential labour force which can increase earnings from work social capital ie the wealth and productive capacity that the people in a society hold in common rather than as individuals or corporations etc Both nonfinancial and financial capital accumulation is usually needed for economic growth since additional production usually requires additional funds to enlarge the scale of production Smarter and more productive organization of production can also increase production without increased capital Capital can be created without increased investment by inventions or improved organization that increase productivity discoveries of new assets oil gold minerals etc the sale of property etc In modern macroeconomics and econometrics the term capital formation is often used in preference to accumulation though the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD refers nowadays to accumulation The term is occasionally used in national accounts The measurement of accumulation Accumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments the amount of income that is reinvested or as the change in the value of assets owned the increase in the value of the capital stock Using company balance sheets tax data and direct surveys as a basis government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of national accounts national balance of payments and flow of funds statistics Usually the Reserve Banks and the Treasury provide interpretations and analysis of this data Standard indicators include Capital formation Gross fixed capital formation fixed capital household asset wealth and foreign direct investment Organisations such as the International Monetary Fund UNCTAD the World Bank Group the OECD and the Bank for International Settlements used national investment data to estimate world trends The Bureau of Economic Analysis Eurostat and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the USA Europe and Japan respectively Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as Fortune Forbes The Economist Business Week etc and various corporate watchdog organisations and nongovernmental organization publications A reputable scientific journal is the Review of Income Wealth In the case of the USA the Analytical Perspectives document an annex to the yearly budget provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country Harrod–Domar model In macroeconomics following the Harrod–Domar model the savings ratio s displaystyle s and the capital coefficient k displaystyle k are regarded as critical factors for accumulation and growth assuming that all saving is used to finance fixed investment The rate of growth of the real stock of fixed capital K displaystyle K is where Y displaystyle Y is the real national income If the capitaloutput ratio or capital coefficient k K Y displaystyle kK over Y is constant the rate of growth of Y displaystyle Y is equal to the rate of growth of K displaystyle K This is determined by s displaystyle s the ratio of net fixed investment or saving to Y displaystyle Y and k displaystyle k A country might for example save and invest 12 of its national income and then if the capital coefficient is 41 ie 4 billion must be invested to increase the national income by 1 billion the rate of growth of the national income might be 3 annually However as Keynesian economics points out savings do not automatically mean investment as liquid funds may be hoarded for example Investment may also not be investment in fixed capital see above Assuming that the turnover of total production capital invested remains constant the proportion of total investment which just maintains the stock of total capital rather than enlarging it will typically increase as the total stock increases The growth rate of incomes and net new investments must then also increase in order to accelerate the growth of the capital stock Simply put the bigger capital grows the more capital it takes to keep it growing and the more markets must expand Marxian concept In Karl Marxs economic theory capital accumulation is the operation whereby profits are reinvested into the economy increasing the total quantity of capital Capital was understood by Marx to be expanding value that is in other terms as a sum of capital usually expressed in money that is transformed through human labor into a larger value extracted as profits and expressed as money Here capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset value in search of additional value surplusvalue This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned and trading rights to be established Overaccumulation and crisis The Marxist analysis of capital accumulation and the development of capitalism identifies systemic issues with the process that arise with expansion of the productive forces A crisis of overaccumulation of capital occurs when the rate of profit is greater than the rate of new profitable investment outlets in the economy arising from increasing productivity from a rising organic composition of capital higher capital input to labor input ratio This depresses the wage bill leading to stagnant wages and high rates of unemployment for the working class while excess profits search for new profitable investment opportunities Marx believed that this cyclical process would be the fundamental cause for the dissolution of capitalism and its replacement by socialism which would operate according to a different economic dynamic In Marxist thought socialism would succeed capitalism as the dominant mode of production when the accumulation of capital can no longer sustain itself due to falling rates of profit in real production relative to increasing productivity A socialist economy would not base production on the accumulation of capital instead basing production on the criteria of satisfying human needs and directly producing usevalues This concept is encapsulated in the principle of production for use Concentration and centralization According to Marx capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of richest capitalists Marx explains It is concentration of capitals already formed destruction of their individual independence expropriation of capitalist by capitalist transformation of many small into few large capitals Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand because it has in another place been lost by many The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities The cheapness of commodities demands caeteris paribus on the productiveness of labour and this again on the scale of production Therefore the larger capitals beat the smaller It will further be remembered that with the development of the capitalist mode of production there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions The smaller capitals therefore crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of Here competition rages It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors partly vanish The rate of accumulation In Marxian economics the rate of accumulation is defined as 1 the value of the real net increase in the stock of capital in an accounting period 2 the proportion of realized surplusvalue or profitincome which is reinvested rather than consumed This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay the realized turnover surplusvalue or profit and reinvestments see eg the writings of the economist Michał Kalecki Other things being equal the greater the amount of profitincome that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be However earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about how much to spend and how much to save In a boom period of capitalism the growth of investments is cumulative ie one investment leads to another leading to a constantly expanding market an expanding labor force and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people In a stagnating decadent capitalism the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces real estate financial speculation and luxury consumption In that case income from valueadding production will decline in favour of interest rent and tax income with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment As a rule the larger the total sum of capital invested the higher the return on investment will be The more capital one owns the more capital one can also borrow and reinvest at a higher rate of profit or interest The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor Ernest Mandel emphasized that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on 1 the division of a societys social product between necessary product and surplus product and 2 the division of the surplus product between investment and consumption In turn this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of competition among capitalists competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors it also involved social factors and power relationships The circuit of capital accumulation from production Strictly speaking capital has accumulated only when realized profit income has been reinvested in capital assets But the process of capital accumulation in production has as suggested in the first volume of Marxs Das Kapital at least 7 distinct but linked moments The initial investment of capital which could be borrowed capital in means of production and labor power The command over surpluslabour and its appropriation The valorisation increase in value of capital through production of new outputs The appropriation of the new output produced by employees containing the added value The realisation of surplusvalue through output sales The appropriation of realised surplusvalue as profit income after deduction of costs The reinvestment of profit income in production All of these moments do not refer simply to an economic or commercial process Rather they assume the existence of legal social cultural and economic power conditions without which creation distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists or where people refuse to trade In fact Marx argues that the original or primitive accumulation of capital often occurs through violence plunder slavery robbery extortion and theft He argues that the capitalist mode of production requires that people be forced to work in valueadding production for someone else and for this purpose they must be cut off from sources of income other than selling their labor power Simple and expanded reproduction In volume 2 of Das Kapital Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank credit capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another alternately taking the form of money capital liquid deposits securities etc commodity capital tradeable products real estate etc or production capital means of production and labor power His discussion of the simple and expanded reproduction of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole At simple reproduction a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given living standard the stock of capital stays constant At expanded reproduction more productvalue is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard a surplus product the additional productvalue is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production The bourgeois claim there is no economic law according to which capital is necessarily reinvested in the expansion of production that such depends on anticipated profitability market expectations and perceptions of investment risk Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions As Marx states in Vol2 simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realized by Dept 1—producers of means of production—exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept 2 producers of articles of consumption pg 524 Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions such as a constant labor supply no population growth Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry pg 514 Ernest Mandel introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction ie reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale for example due to wars natural disasters or devalorisation Balanced economic growth requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions But markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between supply and demand inequality is the motor of growth This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long time Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and protectionism Origins According to Marx capital accumulation has a double origin namely in trade and in expropriation both of a legal or illegal kind The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or trading up but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation David Harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession Marx does not discuss gifts and grants as a source of capital accumulation nor does he analyze taxation in detail He couldnt as he died even before completing his major book Das Kapital Nowadays the tax take is often so large ie 2540 of GDP that some authors refer to state capitalism This gives rise to a proliferation of tax havens to evade tax liability The continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process As markets expand more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in But capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell or refuse to buy for example a strike by investors or workers or consumer resistance Capital accumulation as social relation Accumulation of capital sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist social relations institutions on a larger scale over time ie the expansion of the size of the proletariat and of the wealth owned by the bourgeoisie This interpretation emphasizes that capital ownership predicated on command over labor is a social relation the growth of capital implies the growth of the working class a law of accumulation In the first volume of Das Kapital Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to Edward Gibbon Wakefields theory of colonisation Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies property in money means of subsistence machines and other means of production does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative — the wageworker the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own freewill He discovered that capital is not a thing but a social relation between persons established by the instrumentality of things Mr Peel he moans took with him from England to Swan River West Australia means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £50000 Mr Peel had the foresight to bring with him besides 3000 persons of the workingclass men women and children Once arrived at his destination “Mr Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river” Unhappy Mr Peel who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River — Das Kapital vol 1 ch 33 In the third volume of Das Kapital Marx refers to the fetishism of capital reaching its highest point with interestbearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything In this case The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetishlike form in interestbearing capital We have here M − M ′ displaystyle MM money creating more money selfexpanding value without the process that effectuates these two extremes In merchants capital M − C − M ′ displaystyle MCM there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation not the product of a mere thing This is obliterated in M − M ′ displaystyle MM the form of interestbearing capital The thing money commodity value is now capital even as a mere thing and capital appears as a mere thing The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself It depends on the owner of the money ie of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital In interestbearing capital therefore this automatic fetish selfexpanding value money generating money are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birthmarks of its origin The social relation is consummated in the relation of a thing of money to itself—Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital we see here only form without content — Das Kapital vol1 ch 24 Military wars Wars typically causes the diversion destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war Often this has induced laws against perceived and real war profiteering The total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent War destruction can be illustrated by looking at World War II Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan where 14 of factory buildings and 13 of plant equipment were destroyed 17 of electric powergenerating capacity was destroyed and 67 of oil refining capacity The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80 of their ships In Germany in 1944 when air attacks were heaviest 65 of machine tools were damaged or destroyed but around 90 were later repaired About 10 of steel production capacity was lost In Europe the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes ships tanks etc were built and then lost or destroyed Germanys total war damage was estimated at about 175 of the prewar total capital stock by value ie about 16 In the Berlin area alone there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities In 1945 less than 10 of the railways were still operating 2395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7500 bridges 10000 locomotives and more than 100000 goods wagons were destroyed Less than 40 of the remaining locomotives were operational However by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic which was given assistance and preferences by western appointed military governors for resources and material as an essential asset regained its prewar operational level At the end of the year 90 of Germanys railway lines were operating again In retrospect the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing Initially in May 1945 newly installed US President Harry S Trumans directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany In fact the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of prewar output These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted In 1946 over 10 of Germanys physical capital stock plant equipment was also dismantled and confiscated most of it going to the USSR By 1947 industrial production in Germany was at 13 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 12 the 1938 level The first big strike wave in the Ruhr occurred in early 1947—it was about food rations and housing but soon there were demands for nationalisation The US appointed military Governor Newman however stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations The clear message was no work no eat As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with Marshal Plan aid things rapidly improved By 1951 German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level The Marshall Aid funds were important but after the currency reform which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the USA to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government rather than keeping Germany in a weak position Initially average real wages remained low lower even than in 1938 until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high So the total investment fund aided by credits was also high resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools This was called the German economic miracle or Wirtschaftswunder In Italy the victorious Allies did three things in 1945 they imposed their absolute military authority they quickly disarmed the Italian partisans from a very large stock of weapons and they agreed to a state guarantee of wage payments as well as a veto on all sackings of workers from their jobs Although the Italian Communist Party grew very large immediately after the war ended—it achieved a membership of 17 million people in a population of 45 million—it was outmaneouvred through a complicated political battle by the Christian Democrats after three years In the 1950s an economic boom began in Italy at first fueled by internal demand and then also by exports In the United States in World War II the large investments in industrial plant necessitated by the war brought big advantages but the costs of dead waste and debt would have never been undertaken by any rational government for the slight advantages In modern times it has often been possible to rebuild physical capital assets destroyed in wars completely within the space of about 10 years except in cases of severe pollution by chemical warfare or other kinds of irreparable devastation However damage to human capital has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities in the case of World War II about 55 million deaths permanent physical disability
