 For other uses see Attractor disambiguation In the mathematical field of dynamical systems an attractor is a set of numerical values toward which a system tends to evolve for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system System values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed In finitedimensional systems the evolving variable may be represented algebraically as an ndimensional vector The attractor is a region in ndimensional space In physical systems the n dimensions may be for example two or three positional coordinates for each of one or more physical entities in economic systems they may be separate variables such as the inflation rate and the unemployment rate If the evolving variable is two or threedimensional the attractor of the dynamic process can be represented geometrically in two or three dimensions as for example in the threedimensional case depicted to the right An attractor can be a point a finite set of points a curve a manifold or even a complicated set with a fractal structure known as a strange attractor see strange attractor below If the variable is a scalar the attractor is a subset of the real number line Describing the attractors of chaotic dynamical systems has been one of the achievements of chaos theory A trajectory of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy any special constraints except for remaining on the attractor forward in time The trajectory may be periodic or chaotic If a set of points is periodic or chaotic but the flow in the neighborhood is away from the set the set is not an attractor but instead is called a repeller or repellor Motivation A dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations The equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time To determine the systems behavior for a longer period it is often necessary to integrate the equations either through analytical means or through iteration often with the aid of computers Dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative systems if it were not for some driving force the motion would cease Dissipation may come from internal friction thermodynamic losses or loss of material among many causes The dissipation and the driving force tend to balance killing off initial transients and settle the system into its typical behavior The subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor also known as the attracting section or attractee Invariant sets and limit sets are similar to the attractor concept An invariant set is a set that evolves to itself under the dynamics Attractors may contain invariant sets A limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ie to each point of the set as time goes to infinity Attractors are limit sets but not all limit sets are attractors It is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set For example the damped pendulum has two invariant points the point x0 of minimum height and the point x1 of maximum height The point x0 is also a limit set as trajectories converge to it the point x1 is not a limit set Because of the dissipation due to air resistance the point x0 is also an attractor If there was no dissipation x0 would not be an attractor Mathematical definition Let t represent time and let ft • be a function which specifies the dynamics of the system That is if a is an ndimensional point in the phase space representing the initial state of the system then f0 a a and for a positive value of t ft a is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time For example if the system describes the evolution of a free particle in one dimension then the phase space is the plane R with coordinates xv where x is the position of the particle v is its velocity a  xv and the evolution is given by An attractor is a subset A of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions A is forward invariant under f if a is an element of A then so is fta for all t  0 There exists a neighborhood of A called the basin of attraction for A and denoted BA which consists of all points b that enter A in the limit t → ∞ More formally BA is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property There is no proper nonempty subset of A having the first two properties Since the basin of attraction contains an open set containing A every point that is sufficiently close to A is attracted to A The definition of an attractor uses a metric on the phase space but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space In the case of R the Euclidean norm is typically used Many other definitions of attractor occur in the literature For example some authors require that an attractor have positive measure preventing a point from being an attractor others relax the requirement that BA be a neighborhood Types of attractors Attractors are portions or subsets of the phase space of a dynamical system Until the 1960s attractors were thought of as being simple geometric subsets of the phase space like points lines surfaces and simple regions of threedimensional space More complex attractors that cannot be categorized as simple geometric subsets such as topologically wild sets were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies Stephen Smale was able to show that his horseshoe map was robust and that its attractor had the structure of a Cantor set Two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle Attractors can take on many other geometric shapes phase space subsets But when these sets or the motions within them cannot be easily described as simple combinations eg intersection and union of fundamental geometric objects eg lines surfaces spheres toroids manifolds then the attractor is called a strange attractor Fixed point A fixed point of a function or transformation is a point that is mapped to itself by the function or transformation If we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation The final state that a dynamical system evolves towards corresponds to an attracting fixed point of the evolution function for that system such as the center bottom position of a damped pendulum the level and flat water line of sloshing water in a glass or the bottom center of a bowl contain a rolling marble But the fixed points of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system For example if the bowl containing a rolling marble was inverted and the marble was balanced on top of the bowl the center bottom now top of the bowl is a fixed state but not an attractor This is equivalent to the difference between stable and unstable equilibria In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl a hill that point at the top of the bowl hill is a fixed point equilibrium but not an attractor stable equilibrium In addition physical dynamic systems with at least one fixed point invariably have multiple fixed points and attractors due to the reality of dynamics in the physical world including the nonlinear dynamics of stiction friction surface roughness deformation both elastic and plasticity and even quantum mechanics In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl even if the bowl seems perfectly hemispherical and the marbles spherical shape are both much more complex surfaces when examined under a microscope and their shapes change or deform during contact Any physical surface can be seen to have a rough terrain of multiple peaks valleys saddle points ridges ravines and plains There are many points in this surface terrain and the dynamic system of a similarly rough marble rolling around on this microscopic terrain that are considered stationary or fixed points some of which are categorized as attractors Finite number of points In a discretetime system an attractor can take the form of a finite number of points that are visited in sequence Each of these points is called a periodic point This is illustrated by the logistic map which depending on its specific parameter value can have an attractor consisting of 2 points 3×2 points etc for any value of n Limit cycle Main article Limit cycle A limit cycle is a periodic orbit of a continuous dynamical system that is isolated Examples include the swings of a pendulum clock the tuning circuit of a radio and the heartbeat while resting The limit cycle of an ideal pendulum is not an example of a limit cycle attractor because its orbits are not isolated in the phase space of the ideal pendulum near any point of a periodic orbit there is another point that belongs to a different periodic orbit so the former orbit is not attracting Limit torus There may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle For example in physics one frequency may dictate the rate at which a planet orbits a star while a second frequency describes the oscillations in the distance between the two bodies If two of these frequencies form an irrational fraction ie they are incommensurate the trajectory is no longer closed and the limit cycle becomes a limit torus This kind of attractor is called an Nttorus if there are Nt incommensurate frequencies For example here is a 2torus A time series corresponding to this attractor is a quasiperiodic series A discretely sampled sum of Nt periodic functions not necessarily sine waves with incommensurate frequencies Such a time series does not have a strict periodicity but its power spectrum still consists only of sharp lines Strange attractor An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist If a strange attractor is chaotic exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor after any of various numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart subject to the confines of the attractor and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together Thus a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable once some sequences have entered the attractor nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor The term strange attractor was coined by David Ruelle and Floris Takens to describe the attractor resulting from a series of bifurcations of a system describing fluid flow Strange attractors are often differentiable in a few directions but some are like a Cantor dust and therefore not differentiable Strange attractors may also be found in presence of noise where they may be shown to support invariant random probability measures of Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen type Examples of strange attractors include the doublescroll attractor Hénon attractor Rössler attractor Tamari attractor and the Lorenz attractor Effect of parameters on the attractor A particular functional form of a dynamic equation can have various types of attractor depending on the particular parameter values used in the function An example is the wellstudied logistic map x t 1 r x t 1 − x t displaystyle rxt whose basins of attraction for various values of the parameter r are shown in the diagram At some values of the parameter the attractor is a single point at others it is two points that are visited in turn at others it is 2 points or k × 2 points that are visited in turn for any value of n depending on the value of the parameter r and at other values of r an infinitude of points are visited Basins of attraction An attractors basin of attraction is the region of the phase space over which iterations are defined such that any point any initial condition in that region will eventually be iterated into the attractor For a stable linear system every point in the phase space is in the basin of attraction However in nonlinear systems some points may map directly or asymptotically to infinity while other points may lie in a different basin of attraction and map asymptotically into a different attractor other initial conditions may be in or map directly into a nonattracting point or cycle Linear equation or system A singlevariable univariate linear difference equation of the homogeneous form x t a x t − 1 displaystyle xta diverges to infinity if a 1 from all initial points except 0 there is no attractor and therefore no basin of attraction But if a 1 all points on the number line map asymptotically or directly in the case of 0 to 0 0 is the attractor and the entire number line is the basin of attraction Likewise a linear matrix difference equation in a dynamic vector X of the homogeneous form X t A X t − 1 displaystyle XtAXt1 in terms of square matrix A will have all elements of the dynamic vector diverge to infinity if the largest eigenvalue of A is greater than 1 in absolute value there is no attractor and no basin of attraction But if the largest eigenvalue is less than 1 in magnitude all initial vectors will asymptotically converge to the zero vector which is the attractor the entire ndimensional space of potential initial vectors is the basin of attraction Similar features apply to linear differential equations The scalar equation d x d t a x displaystyle dxdtax causes all initial values of x except zero to diverge to infinity if a 0 but to converge to an attractor at the value 0 if a 0 making the entire number line the basin of attraction for 0 And the matrix system d X d t A X displaystyle dXdtAX gives divergence from all initial points except the vector of zeroes if any eigenvalue of the matrix A is positive but if all the eigenvalues are negative the vector of zeroes is an attractor whose basin of attraction is the entire phase space Nonlinear equation or system Equations or systems that are nonlinear can give rise to a richer variety of behavior than can linear systems One example is Newtons method of iterating to a root of a nonlinear expression If the expression has more than one real root some starting points for the iterative algorithm will lead to one of the roots asymptotically and other starting points will lead to another The basins of attraction for the expressions roots are generally not simple—it is not simply that the points nearest one root all map there giving a basin of attraction consisting of nearby points The basins of attraction can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small For example for the function f x x 3 − 2 x 2 − 11 x 12 displaystyle f2x211x12 the following initial conditions are in successive basins of attraction Newtons method can also be applied to complex functions to find their roots Each root has a basin of attraction in the complex plane these basins can be mapped as in the image shown As can be seen the combined basin of attraction for a particular root can have many disconnected regions For many complex functions the boundaries of the basins of attraction are fractals Partial differential equations Parabolic partial differential equations may have finitedimensional attractors The diffusive part of the equation damps higher frequencies and in some cases leads to a global attractor The Ginzburg–Landau the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky and the twodimensional forced Navier–Stokes equations are all known to have global attractors of finite dimension For the threedimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions if it has a global attractor then this attractor will be of finite dimensions Numerical localization visualization of attractors selfexcited and hidden attractors From a computational point of view attractors can be naturally regarded as selfexcited attractors or hidden attractors Selfexcited attractors can be localized numerically by standard computational procedures in which after a transient sequence a trajectory starting from a point on an unstable manifold in a small neighborhood of an unstable equilibrium reaches an attractor like classical attractors in the Van der Pol Belousov–Zhabotinsky Lorenz and many other dynamical systems In contrast the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria so the hidden attractor cannot be localized by standard computational procedures See also Cycle detection Hyperbolic set Stable manifold Steady state Wada basin Hidden oscillation References Further reading
