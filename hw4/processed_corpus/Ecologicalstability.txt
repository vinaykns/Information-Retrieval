 Ecological stability can refer to types of stability in a continuum ranging from regeneration via resilience returning quickly to a previous state to constancy to persistence The precise definition depends on the ecosystem in question the variable or variables of interest and the overall context In the context of conservation ecology stable populations are often defined as ones that do not go extinct Researchers applying mathematical models from system dynamics usually use Lyapunov stability Types of ecological stability Local stability indicates that a system is stable over small shortlived disturbances while global stability indicates a system highly resistant to change in species composition andor food web dynamics Constancy Observational studies of ecosystems use constancy to describe living systems that can remain unchanged Resistance and inertia persistence Resistance and inertia deal with a systems inherent response to some perturbation A perturbation is any externally imposed change in conditions usually happening in a short time period Resistance is a measure of how little the variable of interest changes in response to external pressures Inertia or persistence implies that the living system is able to resist external fluctuations In the context of changing ecosystems in postglacial North America EC Pielou remarked at the outset of her overview It obviously takes considerable time for mature vegetation to become established on newly exposed ice scoured rocks or glacial tillit also takes considerable time for whole ecosystems to change with their numerous interdependent plant species the habitats these create and the animals that live in the habitats Therefore climatically caused fluctuations in ecological communities are a damped smoothedout version of the climatic fluctuations that cause them Resilience elasticity and amplitude Resilience is the tendency of a system to retain its functional and organisational structure after a perturbation Elasticity and amplitude are measures of resilience Elasticity is the speed with which a system returns Amplitude is a measure of how far a system can be moved from the previous state and still return Ecology borrows the idea of neighborhood stability and a domain of attraction from dynamical systems theory Notes References Hall Charles AS Publication date unclear Ecology Accessed at World Book online reference centre Archived from the original on June 8 2011 Retrieved 20090616  Check date values in date help Note This appears to be a business site accessible via subscription only Unable to verify Halls publication However Hall has published a large number of works pertaining to ecology and the link to his website is below Homepage for publications of Charles A S Hall with Halls publications on ecology Retrieved 20091008  See Complete Publications List in Publications section See also Dynamic equilibrium Keystone species Principle of faunal succession Resilience ecology Systems analysis
