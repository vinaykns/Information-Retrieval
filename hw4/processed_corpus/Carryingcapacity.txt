 The carrying capacity of a biological species in an environment is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely given the food habitat water and other necessities available in the environment In population biology carrying capacity is defined as the environments maximal load which is different from the concept of population equilibrium Its effect on population dynamics may be approximated in a logistic model although this simplification ignores the possibility of overshoot which real systems may exhibit Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it Later the idea was expanded to more complex populations like humans For the human population more complex variables such as sanitation and medical care are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment As population density increases birth rate often decreases and death rate typically increases The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the natural increase The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase Thus the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment Below carrying capacity populations typically increase while above they typically decrease A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a regulating factor Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the species concerned but can include insufficient space food supply or sunlight The carrying capacity of an environment may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including food availability water supply environmental conditions and living space The origins of the term carrying capacity are uncertain with researchers variously stating that it was used in the context of international shipping or that it was first used during 19thcentury laboratory experiments with microorganisms A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the US Secretary of State to the US Senate Humans Main article Human overpopulation Several estimates of the carrying capacity have been made with a wide range of population numbers A 2001 UN report said that twothirds of the estimates fall in the range of 4 billion to 16 billion with unspecified standard errors with a median of about 10 billion More recent estimates are much lower particularly if nonrenewable resource depletion and increased consumption are considered The application of the concept of carrying capacity for the human population has been criticized for not successfully capturing the multilayered processes between humans and the environment which have a nature of fluidity and nonequilibrium and for sometimes being employed in a blamethevictim framework Supporters of the concept argue that the idea of a limited carrying capacity is just as valid applied to humans as when applied to any other species Animal population size living standards and resource depletion vary but the concept of carrying capacity still applies The number of people is not the only factor in the carrying capacity of Earth Waste and overconsumption especially by wealthy people and nations is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation This has been studied by computer simulation models like World3 Factors that govern carrying capacity Some aspects of a systems carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of food water raw materials andor other similar resources In addition there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature such as everincreasing andor everaccumulating levels of wastes damage andor eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system Eradication of for example large or critical portions of any complex system envision a space vehicle for instance or an airplane or an automobile or computer code or the body components of a living vertebrate can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse As an example of these latter factors the carrying capacity of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food or water or available seating but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage destroy or eradicate parts doors windows wings engine parts fuel and oil and so forth Thus on a global scale food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earths human passengers do not dismantle eradicate or otherwise destroy critical biospheric lifesupport capacities for essential processes of selfmaintenance selfperpetuation and selfrepair Thus carrying capacity interpretations that focus solely on resource limitations alone such as food may neglect wider functional factors If the humans neither gain nor lose weight in the longterm the calculation is fairly accurate If the quantity of food is invariably equal to the Y amount carrying capacity has been reached Humans with the need to enhance their reproductive success see Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene understand that food supply can vary and also that other factors in the environment can alter humans need for food A house for example might mean that one does not need to eat as much to stay warm as one otherwise would Over time monetary transactions have replaced barter and local production and consequently modified local human carrying capacity However purchases also impact regions thousands of miles away For example carbon dioxide from an automobile travels to the upper atmosphere This led Paul R Ehrlich to develop the I  PAT equation where An important model related to carrying capacity K is the logistic growth curve The logistic growth curve depicts a more realistic version of how population growth rate available resources and the carrying capacity are interconnected As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model when the population size is small and there are many resources available population overtime increases and so does the growth rate However as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K This model is based on the assumption that carrying capacity does not change One thing to keep in mind however is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it For instance an increase in the population growth can lead to overexploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment Technology can play a role in the dynamics of carrying capacity and while this can sometimes be positive in other cases its influence can be problematic For example it has been suggested that in the past that the Neolithic revolution increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans through the invention of agriculture In a similar way viewed from the perspective of foods the use of fossil fuels has been alleged to artificially increase the carrying capacity of the world by the use of stored sunlight even though that food production does not guarantee the capacity of the Earths climatic and biospheric lifesupport systems to withstand the damage and wastes arising from such fossil fuels However such interpretations presume the continued and uninterrupted functioning of all other critical components of the global system It has also been suggested that other technological advances that have increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans are polders fertilizer composting greenhouses land reclamation and fish farming In an adverse way however many technologies enable economic entities and individual humans to inflict far more damage and eradication far more quickly and efficiently on a widerscale than ever Examples include machine guns chainsaws earthmovers and the capacity of industrialized fishing fleets to capture and harvest targeted fish species faster than the fish themselves can reproduce are examples of such problematic outcomes of technology Agricultural capability on Earth expanded in the last quarter of the 20th century But now there are many projections of a continuation of the decline in world agricultural capability and hence carrying capacity which began in the 1990s Most conspicuously Chinas food production is forecast to decline by 37 by the last half of the 21st century placing a strain on the entire carrying capacity of the world as Chinas population could expand to about 15 billion people by the year 2050 This reduction in Chinas agricultural capability as in other world regions is largely due to the world water crisis and especially due to mining groundwater beyond sustainable yield which has been happening in China since the mid20th century Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute has said It would take 15 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption Environmentally the world is in an overshoot mode Ecological footprint One way to estimate human demand compared to ecosystems carrying capacity is ecological footprint accounting Rather than speculating about future possibilities and limitations imposed by carrying capacity constraints Ecological Footprint accounting provides empirical nonspeculative assessments of the past It compares historic regeneration rates biocapacity against historical human demand ecological footprint in the same year One result shows that humanitys demand footprint in 1999 exceeded the planets biocapacity by 20 However this measurement does not take into account the depletion of the actual fossil fuels which would result in a carbon Footprint many hundreds of times higher than the current calculation There is also concern of the ability of countries around to globe to decrease and maintain their ecological footprints Holden and Linnerud scholars working to provide a better framework that adequately judge sustainability development and maintenance in policy making have generated a diagram that measures the global position of different countries around the world which shows a linear relation between GDP PPP and ecological foot print in 2007 Possible answers to the question of where we are as individual countries attempting to reach sustainability and development methods to reduce ecological foot print According to the Figure 1 diagram the United States had the largest ecological foot print per capita along with Norway Sweden and Austria in comparison to Cuba Bangladesh and Korea See also Arable land Asymmetry Principle
