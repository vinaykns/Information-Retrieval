 Sciencebased medicine redirects here For the website see ScienceBased Medicine Evidencebased medicine EBM is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decisionmaking by emphasizing the use of evidence from welldesigned and conducted research Although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support EBM goes further classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types coming from metaanalyses systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials can yield strong recommendations weaker types such as from casecontrol studies can yield only weak recommendations The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients Use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations evidencebased practice policies It has subsequently spread to describe an approach to decisionmaking that is used at virtually every level of health care as well as other fields evidencebased practice Whether applied to medical education decisions about individuals guidelines and policies applied to populations or administration of health services in general evidencebased medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible decisions and policies should be based on evidence not just the beliefs of practitioners experts or administrators It thus tries to assure that a clinicians opinion which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases is supplemented with all available knowledge from the scientific literature so that best practice can be determined and applied It promotes the use of formal explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students practitioners and policy makers Background history and definition In its broadest form evidencebased medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decisionmaking Medicine has a long tradition of both basic and clinical research that dates back at least to Avicenna An early critique of statistical methods in medicine was published in 1835 However until recently the process by which research results were incorporated in medical decisions was highly subjective Called clinical judgment and the art of medicine the traditional approach to making decisions about individual patients depended on having each individual physician determine what research evidence if any to consider and how to merge that evidence with personal beliefs and other factors In the case of decisions that applied to groups of patients or populations the guidelines and policies would usually be developed by committees of experts but there was no formal process for determining the extent to which research evidence should be considered or how it should be merged with the beliefs of the committee members There was an implicit assumption that decision makers and policy makers would incorporate evidence in their thinking appropriately based on their education experience and ongoing study of the applicable literature Clinical decision making Beginning in the late 1960s several flaws became apparent in the traditional approach to medical decisionmaking Alvan Feinsteins publication of Clinical Judgment in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it In 1972 Archie Cochrane published Effectiveness and Efficiency which described the lack of controlled trials supporting many practices that had previously been assumed to be effective In 1973 John Wennberg began to document wide variations in how physicians practiced Through the 1980s David M Eddy described errors in clinical reasoning and gaps in evidence In the mid 1980s Alvin Feinstein David Sackett and others published textbooks on clinical epidemiology which translated epidemiological methods to physician decision making Toward the end of the 1980s a group at RAND showed that large proportions of procedures performed by physicians were considered inappropriate even by the standards of their own experts These areas of research increased awareness of the weaknesses in medical decision making at the level of both individual patients and populations and paved the way for the introduction of evidencebased methods Evidencebased The term evidencebased medicine as it is currently used has two main tributaries Chronologically the first is the insistence on explicit evaluation of evidence of effectiveness when issuing clinical practice guidelines and other populationlevel policies The second is the introduction of epidemiological methods into medical education and individual patientlevel decisionmaking Evidencebased guidelines and policies The term evidencebased was first used by David M Eddy in the course of his work on populationlevel policies such as clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage of new technologies He first began to use the term evidencebased in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines The manual was widely available in unpublished form in the late 1980s and eventually published by the American College of Medicine Eddy first published the term evidencebased in March 1990 in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association that laid out the principles of evidencebased guidelines and populationlevel policies which Eddy described as explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence Consciously anchoring a policy not to current practices or the beliefs of experts but to experimental evidence The policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence The pertinent evidence must be identified described and analyzed The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence A rationale must be written He discussed evidencebased policies in several other papers published in JAMA in the spring of 1990 Those papers were part of a series of 28 published in JAMA between 1990 and 1997 on formal methods for designing populationlevel guidelines and policies Medical education The term evidencebased medicine was introduced slightly later in the context of medical education This branch of evidencebased medicine has its roots in clinical epidemiology In the autumn of 1990 Gordon Guyatt used it in an unpublished description of a program at McMaster University for prospective or new medical students Guyatt and others first published the term two years later 1992 to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine In 1996 David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidencebased medicine as the conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients It means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research This branch of evidencebased medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research It requires the application of populationbased data to the care of an individual patient while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients predicaments rights and preferences This tributary of evidencebased medicine had its foundations in clinical epidemiology a discipline that teaches medical students and physicians how to apply clinical and epidemiological research studies to their practices The methods were published to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature published in JAMA between 1993 and 2000 by the Evidencebased Medicine Working Group at McMaster University Other definitions for individual level evidencebased medicine have been put forth For example in 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined it as the process of finding appraising and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions In 2010 Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm derived from highquality research on population samples to inform clinical decisionmaking in the diagnosis investigation or management of individual patients Many other definitions have been offered for individual level evidencebased medicine but the one by Sackett and colleagues is the most commonly cited The two original definitions highlight important differences in how evidencebased medicine is applied to populations versus individuals When designing policies such as guidelines that will be applied to large groups of people in settings where there is relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians evidencebased policymaking stresses that there be good evidence documenting that the effectiveness of the test or treatment under consideration In the setting of individual decisionmaking there is additional information about the individual patients Practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment Recognizing the two branches of EBM in 2005 Eddy offered an umbrella definition Evidencebased medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible medical decisions guidelines and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit Progress Both branches of evidencebased medicine spread rapidly On the evidencebased guidelines and policies side explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in 1980 The US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidencebased principles in 1984 In 1985 the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidencebased criteria for covering new technologies Beginning in 1987 specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association wrote many evidencebased guidelines In 1991 Kaiser Permanente a managed care organization in the US began an evidencebased guidelines program In 1991 Richard Smith wrote an editorial in the British Medical Journal and introduced the ideas of evidencebased policies in the UK In 1993 the Cochrane Collaboration created a network of 13 countries to produce of systematic reviews and guidelines In 1997 the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality then known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research or AHCPR established Evidencebased Practice Centers EPCs to produce evidence reports and technology assessments to support the development of guidelines In the same year a National Guideline Clearinghouse that followed the principles of evidencebased policies was created by AHRQ the AMA and the American Association of Health Plans now Americas Health Insurance Plans In 1999 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence NICE was created in the UK A central idea of this branch of evidencebased medicine is that evidence should be classified according to the rigor of its experimental design and the strength of a recommendation should depend on the strength of the evidence On the medical education side programs to teach evidencebased medicine have been created in medical schools in Canada the US the UK Australia and other countries A 2009 study of UK programs found the more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidencebased medicine although there was considerable variation in the methods and content and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time trained tutors and teaching materials Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence For example Uptodate was created in the early 1990s The Cochrane Center began publishing evidence reviews in 1993 BMJ Publishing Group launched a 6monthly periodical in 1995 called Clinical Evidence that provided brief summaries of the current state of evidence about important clinical questions for clinicians Since then many other programs have been developed to make evidence more accessible to practitioners Current practice The term evidencebased medicine is now applied to both the programs that are designing evidencebased guidelines and the programs that teach evidencebased medicine to practitioners By 2000 evidencebased medicine had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both populationlevel and individuallevel decisions In subsequent years use of the term evidencebased had extended to other levels of the health care system An example is evidencebased health services which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidencebased medicine at the organizational or institutional level The concept has also spread outside of healthcare for example in his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society Adrian Smith proposed that evidencebased policy should be established for education prisons and policing policy and all areas of government work The multiple tributaries of evidencebased medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individuallevel information in decisions Thus evidencebased guidelines and policies may not readily hybridise with experiencebased practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement and can lead to contradictions contest and unintended crises The most effective knowledge leaders managers and clinical leaders use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making rather than just formal evidence Evidencebased guidelines may provide the basis for governmentality in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems Methods Steps The steps for designing explicit evidencebased guidelines were described in the late 1980s Formulate the question population intervention comparison intervention outcomes time horizon setting search the literature to identify studies that inform the question interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question if several studies address the question synthesize their results metaanalysis summarize the evidence in evidence tables compare the benefits harms and costs in a balance sheet draw a conclusion about the preferred practice write the guideline write the rationale for the guideline have others review each of the previous steps implement the guideline For the purposes of medical education and individuallevel decision making five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992 and the experience of delegates attending the 2003 Conference of EvidenceBased Health Care Teachers and Developers was summarized into five steps and published in 2005 This five step process can broadly be categorized as Translation of uncertainty to an answerable question and includes critical questioning study design and levels of evidence Systematic retrieval of the best evidence available Critical appraisal of evidence for internal validity that can be broken down into aspects regarding Systematic errors as a result of selection bias information bias and confounding Quantitative aspects of diagnosis and treatment The effect size and aspects regarding its precision Clinical importance of results External validity or generalizability Application of results in practice Evaluation of performance Evidence reviews Systematic reviews of published research studies is a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments The Cochrane Collaboration is one of the bestknown programs that conducts systematic reviews Like other collections of systematic reviews it requires authors to provide a detailed and repeatable plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence Once all the best evidence is assessed treatment is categorized as 1 likely to be beneficial 2 likely to be harmful or 3 evidence did not support either benefit or harm A 2007 analysis of 1016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44 of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial 7 concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful and 49 concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm 96 recommended further research A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews excluding complementary treatments in the 1998 database revealed that according to two readers 413 concluded positive or possibly positive effect 20 concluded evidence of no effect 81 concluded net harmful effects and 213 of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence A review of 145 alternative medicine Cochrane reviews using the 2004 database revealed that 384 concluded positive effect or possibly positive 124 effect 48 concluded no effect 069 concluded harmful effect and 566 concluded insufficient evidence Assessing the quality of evidence Main article Levels of evidence Evidence quality can be assessed based on the source type from metaanalyses and systematic reviews of tripleblind randomized clinical trials with concealment of allocation and no attrition at the top end down to conventional wisdom at the bottom as well as other factors including statistical validity clinical relevance currency and peerreview acceptance Evidencebased medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research For example the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of randomized tripleblind placebocontrolled trials with allocation concealment and complete followup involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition In contrast patient testimonials case reports and even expert opinion however some critics have argued that expert opinion does not belong in the rankings of the quality of empirical evidence because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence and continue that expert opinion would seem to be a separate complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone have little value as proof because of the placebo effect the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence An example that put forth by the US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF Level I Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial Level II1 Evidence obtained from welldesigned controlled trials without randomization Level II2 Evidence obtained from welldesigned cohort or casecontrol analytic studies preferably from more than one center or research group Level II3 Evidence obtained from multiple time series designs with or without the intervention Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence Level III Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience descriptive studies or reports of expert committees Another example of a system for grading evidence is the Oxford UK CEBM Levels of Evidence Most of the evidence ranking schemes grade evidence for therapy and prevention but not for diagnostic tests prognostic markers or harm The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence addresses this issue and provides Levels of evidence for claims about prognosis diagnosis treatment benefits treatment harms and screening The original CEBM Levels was first released in September 2000 for EvidenceBased On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit In 2011 the Oxford CEBM Levels were redesigned by an international team to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in psoriasis and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring hepatocellular carcinoma in Canada Categories of recommendations In guidelines and other publications recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit of the service and the level of evidence on which this information is based The US Preventive Services Task Force uses Level A Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients Level B At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients Level C At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations Level D At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients Level I Scientific evidence is lacking of poor quality or conflicting such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service A system was developed by the GRADE working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research It requires users of GRADE short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence usually as part of a systematic review to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results Authors of GRADE tables grade the quality of evidence into four levels on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect a numerical value being close to what the true effect is The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner The GRADE working group defines quality of evidence and strength of recommendations based on the quality as two different concepts which are commonly confused with each other Systematic reviews may include Randomized Controlled trials that have low risk of bias or observational studies that have high risk of bias In the case of Randomized controlled trials the quality of evidence is high but can be downgraded in five different domains Risk of bias Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies has influenced the estimate of effect Imprecision Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely Indirectness Is a judgement made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied Inconsistency Is a judgement made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies Publication bias Is a judgement made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account In the case of observational studies the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading Large effect This is when methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely Plausible confounding would change the effect This is when despite the presence of a possible confounding factor which is expected to reduce the observed effect the effect estimate still shows significant effect Dose response gradient This is when the intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect Meaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE High Quality Evidence The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value One could interpret it as there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions Moderate Quality Evidence The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value but it is also possible that it may be substantially different One could also interpret it as further research may completely change the conclusions Low Quality Evidence The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different One could interpret it as further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely Very low quality Evidence The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it One could interpret it as new research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely Guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria Some of the important criteria are Balance between desirable and undesirable effects not considering cost Quality of the evidence Values and preferences Costs resource utilization Despite the differences between systems the purposes are the same to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid However the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal Statistical measures Evidencebased medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods Tools used by practitioners of evidencebased medicine include Likelihood ratio Main article Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing The pretest odds of a particular diagnosis multiplied by the likelihood ratio determines the posttest odds Odds can be calculated from and then converted to the more familiar probability This reflects Bayes theorem The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation AUCROC The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUCROC reflects the relationship between sensitivity and specificity for a given test Highquality tests will have an AUCROC approaching 1 and highquality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUCROC Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity but they do not affect AUCROC Number needed to treat NNTNumber needed to harm NNH Number needed to treat or number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety respectively of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome eg survival from cancer in one patient For example if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5 then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests For example if 1339 women age 50–59 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a tenyear period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339 Quality of clinical trials Evidencebased medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications Trial design considerations Highquality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data Generalizability considerations Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts Followup Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the statistical power of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm Power A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference Limitations and criticism Although evidencebased medicine is regarded as the gold standard of clinical practice there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the threefold division of Straus and McAlister limitations universal to the practice of medicine limitations unique to evidencebased medicine and misperceptions of evidencebasedmedicine and the fivepoint categorization of Cohen Stavri and Hersh EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine defines evidence too narrowly is not evidencebased is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients or reduces the autonomy of the doctorpatient relationship In no particular order some published objections include The theoretical ideal of EBM that every narrow clinical question of which hundreds of thousands can exist would be answered by metaanalysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs faces the limitation that research especially the RCTs themselves is expensive thus in reality for the foreseeable future there will always be much more demand for EBM than supply and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources Research produced by EBM such as from randomized controlled trials RCTs may not be relevant for all treatment situations Research tends to focus on specific populations but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms Since certain population segments have been historically underresearched racial minorities and people with comorbid diseases evidence from RCTs may not be generalizable to those populations Thus EBM applies to groups of people but this should not preclude clinicians from using their personal experience in deciding how to treat each patient One author advises that the knowledge gained from clinical research does not directly answer the primary clinical question of what is best for the patient at hand and suggests that evidencebased medicine should not discount the value of clinical experience Another author stated that the practice of evidencebased medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research Research can be influenced by biases such as publication bias and conflict of interest For example studies with conflicts due to industry funding are more likely to favor their product There is a lag between when the RCT is conducted and when its results are published There is a lag between when results are published and when these are properly applied Hypocognition the absence of a simple consolidated mental framework that new information can be placed into can hinder the application of EBM Values while patient values are considered in the original definition of EBM the importance of values is not commonly emphasized in EBM training a potential problem under current study Application of evidence in clinical settings One of the ongoing challenges with evidencebased medicine is that some healthcare providers do not follow the evidence This happens partly because the current balance of evidence for and against treatments shifts constantly and it is impossible to learn about every change Even when the evidence is unequivocally against a treatment it usually takes ten years for other treatments to be adopted In other cases significant change can require a generation of physicians to retire or die and be replaced by physicians who were trained with more recent evidence Another major cause of physicians and other healthcare providers treating patients in ways unsupported by the evidence is that the these healthcare providers are subject to the same cognitive biases as all other humans They may reject the evidence because they have a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome the availability heuristic such as a patient dying after refusing treatment They may overtreat to do something or to address a patients emotional needs They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible Education The Berlin questionnaire and the Fresno Test are the most validated instruments for assessing the effectiveness of education in evidencebased medicine These questionnaires have been used in diverse settings See also Health and fitness portal Medicine portal Anecdotal evidence
