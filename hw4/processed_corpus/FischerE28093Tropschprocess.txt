 The Fischer–Tropsch process is a collection of chemical reactions that converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons It was first developed by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch at the KaiserWilhelmInstitut für Kohlenforschung in Mülheim an der Ruhr Germany in 1925 The process a key component of gas to liquids technology produces a synthetic lubrication oil and synthetic fuel typically from coal natural gas or biomass The Fischer–Tropsch process has received intermittent attention as a source of lowsulfur diesel fuel and to address the supply or cost of petroleumderived hydrocarbons A Fischer–Tropschtype process has also been suggested to have produced a few of the building blocks of DNA and RNA within asteroids Reaction mechanism The Fischer–Tropsch process involves a series of chemical reactions that produce a variety of hydrocarbons ideally having the formula CnH2n2 The more useful reactions produce alkanes as follows where n is typically 10–20 The formation of methane n 1 is unwanted Most of the alkanes produced tend to be straightchain suitable as diesel fuel In addition to alkane formation competing reactions give small amounts of alkenes as well as alcohols and other oxygenated hydrocarbons Fischer–Tropsch intermediates and elemental reactions Converting a mixture of H2 and CO into aliphatic products obviously should be a multistep reaction with several sorts of intermediates The growth of the hydrocarbon chain may be visualized as involving a repeated sequence in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon and oxygen the C–O bond is split and a new C–C bond is formed For one –CH2– group produced by CO 2 H2 → CH2 H2O several reactions are necessary Associative adsorption of CO Splitting of the C–O bond Dissociative adsorption of 2 H2 Transfer of 2 H to the oxygen to yield H2O Desorption of H2O Transfer of 2 H to the carbon to yield CH2 The conversion of CO to alkanes involves hydrogenation of CO the hydrogenolysis cleavage with H2 of C–O bonds and the formation of C–C bonds Such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surfacebound metal carbonyls The CO ligand is speculated to undergo dissociation possibly into oxide and carbide ligands Other potential intermediates are various C1 fragments including formyl CHO hydroxycarbene HCOH hydroxymethyl CH2OH methyl CH3 methylene CH2 methylidyne CH and hydroxymethylidyne COH Furthermore and critical to the production of liquid fuels are reactions that form C–C bonds such as migratory insertion Many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete metal clusters but homogeneous Fischer–Tropsch catalysts are poorly developed and of no commercial importance Addition of isotopically labelled alcohol to the feed stream results in incorporation of alcohols into product This observation establishes the facility of C–O bond scission Using Clabelled ethylene and propene over cobalt catalysts results in incorporation of these olefins into the growing chain Chain growth reaction thus appears to involve both ‘olefin insertion’ as well as ‘COinsertion’ Feedstocks gasification Fischer–Tropsch plants associated with coal or related solid feedstocks sources of carbon must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants ie CO H2 and alkanes This conversion is called gasification and the product is called synthesis gas syngas Synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a H2CO ratio of 07 compared to the ideal ratio of 2 This ratio is adjusted via the watergas shift reaction Coalbased Fischer–Tropsch plants produce varying amounts of CO2 depending upon the energy source of the gasification process However most coalbased plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the Fischer–Tropsch process Feedstocks GTL Carbon monoxide for FT catalysis is derived from hydrocarbons In gas to liquids GTL technology the hydrocarbons are low molecular weight materials that often would be discarded or flared Stranded gas provides relatively cheap gas GTL is viable provided gas remains relatively cheaper than oil Several reactions are required to obtain the gaseous reactants required for Fischer–Tropsch catalysis First reactant gases entering a Fischer–Tropsch reactor must be desulfurized Otherwise sulfurcontaining impurities deactivate poison the catalysts required for Fischer–Tropsch reactions Several reactions are employed to adjust the H2CO ratio Most important is the water gas shift reaction which provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide For Fischer–Tropsch plants that use methane as the feedstock another important reaction is steam reforming which converts the methane into CO and H2 Process conditions Generally the Fischer–Tropsch process is operated in the temperature range of 150–300 °C 302–572 °F Higher temperatures lead to faster reactions and higher conversion rates but also tend to favor methane production For this reason the temperature is usually maintained at the low to middle part of the range Increasing the pressure leads to higher conversion rates and also favors formation of longchained alkanes both of which are desirable Typical pressures range from one to several tens of atmospheres Even higher pressures would be favorable but the benefits may not justify the additional costs of highpressure equipment and higher pressures can lead to catalyst deactivation via coke formation A variety of synthesisgas compositions can be used For cobaltbased catalysts the optimal H2CO ratio is around 18–21 Ironbased catalysts can tolerate lower ratios due to intrinsic Water Gas Shift Reaction activity of the Iron catalyst This reactivity can be important for synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass which tend to have relatively low H2CO ratios  1 Design of the FischerTropsch process reactor Efficient removal of heat from the reactor is the basic need of Fischer–Tropsch reactors since these reactions are characterized by high exothermicity Four types of reactors are discussed Product distribution In general the product distribution of hydrocarbons formed during the Fischer–Tropsch process follows an Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution which can be expressed as where Wn is the weight fraction of hydrocarbons containing n carbon atoms α is the chain growth probability or the probability that a molecule will continue reacting to form a longer chain In general α is largely determined by the catalyst and the specific process conditions Examination of the above equation reveals that methane will always be the largest single product so long as α is less than 05 however by increasing α close to one the total amount of methane formed can be minimized compared to the sum of all of the various longchained products Increasing α increases the formation of longchained hydrocarbons The very longchained hydrocarbons are waxes which are solid at room temperature Therefore for production of liquid transportation fuels it may be necessary to crack some of the Fischer–Tropsch products In order to avoid this some researchers have proposed using zeolites or other catalyst substrates with fixed sized pores that can restrict the formation of hydrocarbons longer than some characteristic size usually n  10 This way they can drive the reaction so as to minimize methane formation without producing lots of longchained hydrocarbons Such efforts have met with only limited success Catalysts A variety of catalysts can be used for the Fischer–Tropsch process the most common are the transition metals cobalt iron and ruthenium Nickel can also be used but tends to favor methane formation “methanation” Cobalt Cobaltbased catalysts are highly active although iron may be more suitable for certain applications Cobalt catalysts are more active for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio so the watergasshift is not needed for cobalt catalysts Iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass Synthesis gases derived from these hydrogenpoor feedstocks has a lowhydrogencontent and require the water–gas shift reaction Unlike the other metals used for this process Co Ni Ru which remain in the metallic state during synthesis iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases including various oxides and carbides during the reaction Control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles In addition to the active metal the catalysts typically contain a number of promoters including potassium and copper Group 1 alkali metals including potassium are a poison for cobalt catalysts but are promoters for iron catalysts Catalysts are supported on highsurfacearea binderssupports such as silica alumina or zeolites Promotors also have an important influence on activity Alkali metal oxides and copper are common promotors but the formulation depends on the primary metal iron vs cobalt Alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings C≥5 and CO2 selectivity increase while methane and C2–C4 selectivity decrease In addition the alkene to alkane ratio increases Fischer–Tropsch catalysts are sensitive to poisoning by sulfurcontaining compounds Cobaltbased catalysts are more sensitive than for their iron counterparts Iron Fischer–Tropsch iron catalysts need alkali promotion to attain high activity and stability eg 05 wt K 2O Addition of Cu for reduction promotion addition of SiO 2 Al 2O 3 for structural promotion and maybe some manganese can be applied for selectivity control eg high olefinicity The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued One direction has aimed at a lowmolecularweight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process Sasol–Synthol process Due to the relatively high reaction temperature approx 340 °C the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small particle diameter 100 µm and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite plus promoters after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate For maximising the overall gasoline yield C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol However recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in eg polymerization processes is advantageous today The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature where most of the hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions Typically such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol however it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel Thus iron catalysts are very flexible Ruthenium Ruthenium is most active working at the lowest reaction temperature It produces the highest molecular weight hydrocarbons ‘polymethylene synthesis’ Pichler and Buffleb performing thus the chain growth reaction in the cleanest mode it acts as a Fischer Tropsch catalyst as the pure metal without any promotors thus providing the simplest catalytic system of Fischer Tropsch synthesis where mechanistic conclusions should be the easiest—eg much easier than with iron as the catalyst Like with nickel the selectivity changes to mainly methane at elevated temperature Its high price and limited world resources exclude industrial application Systematic Fischer Tropsch studies with ruthenium catalysts should contribute substantially to the further exploration of the fundamentals of Fischer Tropsch synthesis There is an interesting question to consider what features have the metals nickel iron cobalt and ruthenium in common to let them—and only them—be Fischer–Tropsch catalysts converting the COH2 mixture to aliphatic long chain hydrocarbons in a ‘one step reaction’ The term ‘one step reaction’ means that reaction intermediates are not desorbed from the catalyst surface In particular it is amazing that the much carbided alkalized iron catalyst gives this reaction similarly as the just metallic ruthenium catalyst It will be seen in the next section that the kinetic principle of ‘selective inhibition’ might be the common feature which appliesin spite of differences in catalyst composition reaction intermediates steps of reaction and corresponding kinetic schemes HTFT and LTFT Hightemperature Fischer–Tropsch or HTFT is operated at temperatures of 330–350 °C and uses an ironbased catalyst This process was used extensively by Sasol in their coaltoliquid plants CTL LowTemperature Fischer–Tropsch LTFT is operated at lower temperatures and uses an iron or cobaltbased catalyst This process is best known for being used in the first integrated GTLplant operated and built by Shell in Bintulu Malaysia History Since the invention of the original process by Fischer and Tropsch working at the KaiserWilhelmInstitut for Chemistry in the 1920s many refinements and adjustments were made Fischer and Tropsch filed a number of patents eg US Patent 1746464 applied 1926 published 1930 It was commercialized by Brabag in Germany in 1936 Being petroleumpoor but coalrich Germany used the Fischer–Tropsch process during World War II to produce ersatz replacement fuels Fischer–Tropsch production accounted for an estimated 9 of German war production of fuels and 25 of the automobile fuel The United States Bureau of Mines in a program initiated by the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act employed seven Operation Paperclip synthetic fuel scientists in a Fischer–Tropsch plant in Louisiana Missouri in 1946 In Britain Alfred August Aicher obtained several patents for improvements to the process in the 1930s and 1940s Aichers company was named Synthetic Oils Ltd not related to a company of the same name in Canada Commercialization The Fischer–Tropsch process has been applied in largescale gas–liquids and coal–liquid facilities such as Shells Pearl GTL facility in Ras Laffan Qatar Such large facilities are susceptible to high capital costs high operation and maintenance costs the uncertain and volatile price of crude oil and the involvement of potentially environmentally damaging processes In particular the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of stranded gas ie sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with conventional gas pipelines and LNG technology otherwise the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable Several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of socalled stranded gas reserves Conventional FT reactors have been optimized for massive coaltoliquids and gas–liquid facilities such as Shells Pearl GTL facility These slurry bed and fixedbed reactors are much larger than the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smallerscale naturalgas fields The use of microchannel reactors such as those developed by Velocys intensifies the reaction scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional FT technology Enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control which maximizes catalyst activity and life While no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation indications show capital costs operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional FT facilities In Australia Linc Energy commenced construction in 1999 of the worlds first gas–liquid plant operating on synthesis gas produced by underground coal gasification The GTL plant uses the FT process and produced liquids in 2008 Sasol Main article Sasol The largest scale implementation of Fischer–Tropsch technology are in a series of plants operated by Sasol in South Africa a country with large coal reserves but little oil The first commercial plant opened in 1952 40 miles south of Johannesburg Sasol uses coal and now natural gas as feedstocks and produces a variety of synthetic petroleum products including most of the countrys diesel fuel In December 2012 Sasol announced plans to build a 96000 barrels a day plant in Westlake Louisiana using natural gas from tight shale formations in Louisiana and Texas as feedstock Costs are estimated to be between 11 and 12 billion dollars with 2 billion in tax relief being contributed by the state of Louisiana The planned complex will include a refinery and a chemical plant PetroSA PetroSA a South African company which in a joint venture won project innovation of the year award at the Petroleum Economist Awards in 2008 has the worlds largest Gas to Liquids complexes at Mossel Bay in South Africa The refinery is a 36000 barrels a day plant that completed semicommercial demonstration in 2011 paving the way to begin commercial preparation The technology can be used to convert natural gas biomass or coal into synthetic fuels Shell middle distillate synthesis One of the largest implementations of Fischer–Tropsch technology is in Bintulu Malaysia This Shell facility converts natural gas into lowsulfur Diesel fuels and foodgrade wax The scale is 12000 barrels per day 1900 md Ras Laffan Qatar Main article Oryx GTL The new LTFT facility Pearl GTL which began operation in 2011 at Ras Laffan Qatar uses cobalt catalysts at 230 °C converting natural gas to petroleum liquids at a rate of 140000 barrels per day 22000 md with additional production of 120000 barrels 19000 m of oil equivalent in natural gas liquids and ethane The first GTL plant in Ras Laffan was commissioned in 2007 and is called Oryx GTL and has a capacity of 34000 barrels per day 5400 md The plant utilizes the Sasol slurry phase distillate process which uses a cobalt catalyst Oryx GTL is a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Sasol Velocys Construction is underway for Velocys’ commercial reference plant incorporating its microchannel FischerTropsch technology ENVIA Energys Oklahoma City GTL project being built adjacent to Waste Managements East Oak landfill site The project is being financed by a joint venture between Waste Management NRG Energy Ventech and Velocys The feedstock for this plant will be a combination of landfill gas and pipeline natural gas UPM Finland In October 2006 Finnish paper and pulp manufacturer UPM announced its plans to produce biodiesel by the Fischer–Tropsch process alongside the manufacturing processes at its European paper and pulp plants using waste biomass resulting from paper and pulp manufacturing processes as source material Rentech A demonstrationscale Fischer–Tropsch plant was built and operated by Rentech Inc in partnership with ClearFuels a company specializing in biomass gasification Located in Commerce City Colorado the facility produces about 10 barrels per day 16 md of fuels from natural gas Commercialscale facilities are planned for Rialto California Natchez Mississippi Port St Joe Florida and White River Ontario Rentech closed down their pilot plant in 2013 and abandoned work on their FT process as well as the proposed commercial facilities Other In the United States and India some coalproducing states have invested in Fischer–Tropsch plants In Pennsylvania Waste Management and Processors Inc was funded by the state to implement Fischer–Tropsch technology licensed from Shell and Sasol to convert socalled waste coal leftovers from the mining process into lowsulfur diesel fuel Research developments Choren Industries has built a plant in Germany that converts biomass to syngas and fuels using the Shell Fischer–Tropsch process structure The company went bankrupt in 2011 due to impracticalities in the process Biomass gasification BG and Fischer–Tropsch FT synthesis can in principle be combined to produce renewable transportation fuels biofuels US Air Force certification Syntroleum a publicly traded United States company has produced over 400000 US gallons 1500000 L of diesel and jet fuel from the Fischer–Tropsch process using natural gas and coal at its demonstration plant near Tulsa Oklahoma Syntroleum is working to commercialize its licensed Fischer–Tropsch technology via coaltoliquid plants in the United States China and Germany as well as gastoliquid plants internationally Using natural gas as a feedstock the ultraclean low sulfur fuel has been tested extensively by the United States Department of Energy DOE and the United States Department of Transportation DOT Most recently Syntroleum has been working with the United States Air Force to develop a synthetic jet fuel blend that will help the Air Force to reduce its dependence on imported petroleum The Air Force which is the United States militarys largest user of fuel began exploring alternative fuel sources in 1999 On December 15 2006 a B52 took off from Edwards Air Force Base California for the first time powered solely by a 50–50 blend of JP8 and Syntroleums FT fuel The sevenhour flight test was considered a success The goal of the flight test program is to qualify the fuel blend for fleet use on the services B52s and then flight test and qualification on other aircraft The test program concluded in 2007 This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative an effort to develop secure domestic sources for the military energy needs The Pentagon hopes to reduce its use of crude oil from foreign producers and obtain about half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016 With the B52 now approved to use the FT blend the C17 Globemaster III the B1B and eventually every airframe in its inventory to use the fuel by 2011 Carbon dioxide reuse Carbon dioxide is not a typical feedstock for FT catalysis Hydrogen and carbon dioxide react over a cobaltbased catalyst producing methane With ironbased catalysts unsaturated shortchain hydrocarbons are also produced Upon introduction to the catalysts support ceria functions as a reverse water gas shift catalyst further increasing the yield of the reaction The shortchain hydrocarbons were upgraded to liquid fuels over solid acid catalysts such as zeolites Process efficiency Using conventional FT technology the process ranges in carbon efficiency from 25 to 50 percent and a thermal efficiency of about 50 for CTL facilities idealised at
