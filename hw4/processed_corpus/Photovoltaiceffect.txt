 The photovoltaic effect is the creation of voltage or electric current in a material upon exposure to light and is a physical and chemical propertyphenomenon The photovoltaic effect is closely related to the photoelectric effect In either case light is absorbed causing excitation of an electron or other charge carrier to a higherenergy state The main distinction is that the term photoelectric effect is now usually used when the electron is ejected out of the material usually into a vacuum and photovoltaic effect used when the excited charge carrier is still contained within the material In either case an electric potential or voltage is produced by the separation of charges and the light has to have a sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for excitation The physical essence of the difference is usually that photoelectric emission separates the charges by ballistic conduction and photovoltaic emission separates them by diffusion but some hot carrier photovoltaic device concepts blur even this line of distinction The first demonstration of the photovoltaic effect in 1839 used an electrochemical cell but the most familiar form of the photovoltaic effect in modern times though is in solidstate devices mainly in photodiodes When sunlight or other sufficiently energetic light is incident upon the photodiode the electrons present in the valence band absorb energy and being excited jump to the conduction band and become free These excited electrons diffuse and some reach the rectifying junction usually a pn junction where they are accelerated into a different material by a builtin potential Galvani potential This generates an electromotive force and thus some of the light energy is converted into electric energy The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called twophoton photovoltaic effect The photovoltaic effect was first observed by French physicist A E Becquerel in 1839 He explained his discovery in Les Comptes Rendus de lAcademie des Sciences the production of an electric current when two plates of platinum or gold immersed in an acid neutral or alkaline solution are exposed in an uneven way to solar radiation Besides the direct excitation of free electrons a photovoltaic effect can also arise simply due to the heating caused by absorption of the light The heating leads to an increase in temperature which is accompanied by temperature gradients These thermal gradients in turn may generate a voltage through the Seebeck effect Whether direct excitation or thermal effects dominate the photovoltaic effect will depend on many material parameters In most photovoltaic applications the radiation is sunlight and the devices are called solar cells In the case of a pn junction solar cell illuminating the material creates an electric current as excited electrons and the remaining holes are swept in different directions by the builtin electric field of the depletion region See also Theory of solar cells Electromotive force in solar cells References
