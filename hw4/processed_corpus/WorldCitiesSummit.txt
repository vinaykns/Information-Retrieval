still manages to retain a surprisingly rich array of biodiversity by virtue of its geographical location within a biodiversity hotspot Therefore Singapore is well suited and equipped with relevant expertise to establish a cities biodiversity index Hence Singapores Minister for National Development Mr Mah Bow Tan proposed the establishment of an index to measure biodiversity in cities at the 9th Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Bonn Germany in May 2008 To lay out the details for the index the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the National Parks Board of Singapore jointly organised a Technical Expert Workshop on The Singapore Index on Cities Biodiversity 17 technical experts on biodiversity indicators as well as city executives responsible for implementation and management of biodiversity and urban projects attended the workshop The Singapore Index on Cities Biodiversity would measure performance and assign scores based on three categories Biodiversity the number of plant animal and other species that exist in a city The services that these plants and animals provide such as pollination and as carbon sinks How well a city manages its biodiversity for instance by setting up a conservation agency or a museum to document species and habitats The Index will be presented for endorsement during the 10th Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya Japan in October 2010 A User’s Manual for the Singapore Index on Cities’ Biodiversity is available online More information about biodiversity conservation in Singapore is available from the National Biodiversity Centre 2014 Suzhou won the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize in 2014 for its transformation over the prior two decades
