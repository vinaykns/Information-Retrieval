 This article is about the general production and development model For its application to software see Opensource software development model For other uses see Open source disambiguation The opensource model is a decentralized development model that encourages open collaboration A main principle of opensource software development is peer production with products such as source code blueprints and documentation freely available to the public The opensource movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code The model is used for projects such as in opensource appropriate technologies and opensource drug discovery Open source promotes universal access via an opensource or free license to a products design or blueprint and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint Before the phrase open source became widely adopted developers and producers used a variety of other terms Open source gained hold with the rise of the Internet The opensource software movement arose to clarify copyright licensing domain and consumer issues Generally open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use andor modification from its original design Opensource code is meant to be a collaborative effort where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community Code is released under the terms of a software license Depending on the license terms others may then download modify and publish their version fork back to the community Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the opensource movement including the Apache Software Foundation which supports community projects such as the opensource framework Apache Hadoop and the opensource HTTP server Apache HTTP History Main article History of free and opensource software The sharing of technical information predates the Internet and the personal computer considerably For instance in the early years of automobile development a group of capital monopolists owned the rights to a 2cycle gasoline engine patent originally filed by George B Selden By controlling this patent they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands or risk a lawsuit In 1911 independent automaker Henry Ford won a challenge to the Selden patent The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association which would eventually become the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association was formed The new association instituted a crosslicensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers although each company would develop technology and file patents these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers By the time the US entered World War II 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers without any exchange of money or lawsuits Early instances of the free sharing of source code include IBMs source releases of its operating systems and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s and the SHARE user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software Beginning in the 1960s ARPANET researchers used an open Request for Comments RFC process to encourage feedback in early telecommunication network protocols This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969 The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive with software distributed via UUCP Usenet IRC and Gopher BSD for example was first widely distributed by posts to composlinux on the Usenet which is also where its development was discussed Linux followed in this model Open source as a term The term open source was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term free software and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position In addition the ambiguity of the term free software was seen as discouraging business adoption The group included Christine Peterson Todd Anderson Larry Augustin Jon Hall Sam Ockman Michael Tiemann and Eric S Raymond Peterson suggested open source at a meeting held at Palo Alto California in reaction to Netscapes announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for Navigator Linus Torvalds gave his support the following day and Phil Hughes backed the term in Linux Journal Richard Stallman the founder of the free software movement initially seemed to adopt the term but later changed his mind Netscape released its source code under the Netscape Public License and later under the Mozilla Public License Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998 Shortly after he founded The Open Source Initiative in collaboration with Bruce Perens The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim OReilly Originally titled the Freeware Summit and later known as the Open Source Summit the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and opensource projects including Linus Torvalds Larry Wall Brian Behlendorf Eric Allman Guido van Rossum Michael Tiemann Paul Vixie Jamie Zawinski and Eric Raymond At that meeting alternatives to the term free software were discussed Tiemann argued for sourceware as a new term while Raymond argued for open source The assembled developers took a vote and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening Open source has never managed to entirely supersede the older term free software giving rise to the combined term free and opensource software FOSS Economics Main article Opensource economics Some economists agree that opensource is an information good or knowledge good with original work involving a significant amount of time money and effort The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost – this is referred to as the marginal cost of a product Copyright creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a derivative work—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature or a remix of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so Being organized as effectively a consumers cooperative open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works Organizations such as Creative Commons host websites where individuals can file for alternative licenses or levels of restriction for their works These selfmade protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement Others argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place By this argument consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available In practice content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies or an open license Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development such as the pharmaceutical industry which depends largely on patents not copyright for intellectual property protection are almost exclusively proprietary although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on opensource principles There is evidence that opensource development creates enormous value For example in the context of opensource hardware design digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies eg RepRap 3D printers can replicate the product for the cost of materials The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the peer production community Licensing alternatives Further information Business models for opensource software Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model Examples include Creation for its own sake – For example Wikipedia editors add content for recreation Artists have a drive to create Both communities benefit from free starting material Voluntary afterthefact donations – used by shareware street performers and public broadcasting in the United States Patron – For example open access publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement Works of the US federal government are automatically released into the public domain Freemium – Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version potentially using a dual license Give away the product and charge something related – Charge for support of opensource enterprise software give away music but charge for concert admission Give away work in order to gain market share – Used by artists in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor for example in the browser wars and the Android operating system For own use – Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem bearing the full cost of initial creation They will then open source the solution and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users free riders can also benefit without undermining the creation process Open source applications Social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields But Eric Raymond and other founders of the opensource movement have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling The broader impact of the opensource movement and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures remain to be seen The opensource movement has inspired increased transparency and liberty in biotechnology research for example by CAMBIA Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of opensource principles It has also given rise to the rapidlyexpanding opensource hardware movement Computer software Main article Free and open source software Opensource software is software whose source code is published and made available to the public enabling anyone to copy modify and redistribute the source code without paying royalties or fees Opensource code can evolve through community cooperation These communities are composed of individual programmers as well as large companies Some of the individual programmers who start an opensource project may end up establishing companies offering products or services incorporating opensource programs Examples of opensource software products are Electronics Opensource hardware is hardware whose initial specification usually in a software format are published and made available to the public enabling anyone to copy modify and redistribute the hardware and source code without paying royalties or fees Opensource hardware evolves through community cooperation These communities are composed of individual hardwaresoftware developers hobbyists as well as very large companies Examples of opensource hardware initiatives are Openmoko a family of opensource mobile phones including the hardware specification and the operating system OpenRISC an opensource microprocessor family with architecture specification licensed under GNU GPL and implementation under LGPL Sun Microsystemss OpenSPARC T1 Multicore processor Sun has released it under GPL Arduino a microcontroller platform for hobbyists artists and designers GizmoSphere an opensource development platform for the embedded design community the site includes code downloads and hardware schematics along with free user guides spec sheets and other documentation Simputer an open hardware handheld computer designed in India for use in environments where computing devices such as personal computers are deemed inappropriate LEON A family of opensource microprocessors distributed in a library with peripheral IP cores open SPARC V8 specification implementation available under GNU GPL Tinkerforge A system of opensource stackable microcontroller building blocks Allows to control motors and read out sensors with the programming languages C C C Object Pascal Java PHP Python and Ruby over a USB or Wifi connection on Windows Linux and Mac OS X All of the hardware is licensed under CERN OHL CERN Open Hardware License Open Compute Project designs for computer data center including power supply Intel motherboard AMD motherboard chassis racks battery cabinet and aspects of electrical and mechanical design Lasersaur an opensource laser cutter Food and beverages Some publishers of openaccess journals have argued that data from food science and gastronomy studies should be freely available to aid reproducibility A number of people have published creative commons licensed recipe books Opensource colas – cola soft drinks similar to CocaCola and Pepsi whose recipe is open source and developed by volunteers The taste is said to be comparable to that of the standard beverages Most corporations producing beverages hold their formulas as closely guarded secrets Free Beer originally Vores Øl – is an opensource beer created by students at the ITUniversity in Copenhagen together with Superflex an artist collective to illustrate how opensource concepts might be applied outside the digital world In 2002 the beer company Brewtopia in Australia started an opensource brewery and invited the general population to be involved in the development and ownership of the brewery and to vote on the development of every aspect of its beer Blowfly and its road to market In return for their feedback and input individuals received shares in the company which is now publicly traded on a stock exchange in Australia The company has always adhered to its opensource roots and is the only beer company in the world that allows the public to design customise and develop its own beers online Digital content Opencontent projects organized by the Wikimedia Foundation – Sites such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have embraced the opencontent Creative Commons content licenses These licenses were designed to adhere to principles similar to various opensource software development licenses Many of these licenses ensure that content remains free for reuse that source documents are made readily available to interested parties and that changes to content are accepted easily back into the system Important sites embracing opensourcelike ideals are Project Gutenberg and Wikisource both of which post many books on which the copyright has expired and are thus in the public domain ensuring that anyone has free unlimited access to that content Open ICEcat is an open catalog for the IT CE and Lighting sectors with product datasheets based on Open Content License agreement The digital content are distributed in XML and URL formats Google Sketchups 3D Warehouse is an opensource design community centered around the use of proprietary software thats free The University of Waterloo Stratford Campus invites students every year to use its threestorey Christie MicroTiles wall as a digital canvas for their creative work Medicine Pharmaceuticals – There have been several proposals for opensource pharmaceutical development which led to the establishment of the Tropical Disease Initiative and the Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium Genomics – The term opensource genomics refers to the combination of rapid release of sequence data especially raw reads and crowdsourced analyses from bioinformaticians around the world that characterised the analysis of the 2011 E coli O104H4 outbreak OpenEMR – OpenEMR is an ONCATB Ambulatory EHR 20112012 certified electronic health records and medical practice management application It features fully integrated electronic health records practice management scheduling electronic billing and is the base for many EHR programs httpwwwopenemrorg Science and engineering Research – The Science Commons was created as an alternative to the expensive legal costs of sharing and reusing scientific works in journals etc Research – The Open Source Science Project was created to increase the ability for students to participate in the research process by providing them access to microfunding – which in turn offers nonresearchers the opportunity to directly invest and follow cuttingedge scientific research All data and methodology is subsequently published in an openly accessible manner under a Creative Commons fair use license Research – The Open Solar Outdoors Test Field OSOTF is a gridconnected photovoltaic test system which continuously monitors the output of a number of photovoltaic modules and correlates their performance to a long list of highly accurate meteorological readings The OSOTF is organized under opensource principles – All data and analysis is to be made freely available to the entire photovoltaic community and the general public Engineering – Hyperloop a form of highspeed transport proposed by entrepreneur Elon Musk which he describes as an elevated reducedpressure tube that contains pressurized capsules driven within the tube by a number of linear electric motors Construction – WikiHouse is an opensource project for designing and building houses Energy research The Open Energy Modelling Initiative promotes opensource models and open data in energy research and policy advice Robotics Main article Opensource robotics An opensource robot is a robot whose blueprints schematics andor source code are released under an opensource model Transport Open Trip Planner this code base is growing rapidly with adoption in Portland New York The Netherlands and Helsinki TravelSpirit – a greater level of superarchitecture ambition to bring a range of open source projects together in order to deliver Mobility as a Service Fashion Eyewear – In June 2013 an opensource eyewear brand Botho has started trading under the UK based Open Optics Ltd company Other Opensource principles can be applied to technical areas such as digital communication protocols and data storage formats Open design – which involves applying opensource methodologies to the design of artifacts and systems in the physical world It is very nascent but has huge potential Opensourceappropriate technology OSAT refers to technologies that are designed in the same fashion as free and opensource software These technologies must be appropriate technology AT – meaning technology that is designed with special consideration to the environmental ethical cultural social political and economic aspects of the community it is intended for An example of this application is the use of opensource 3D printers like the RepRap to manufacture appropriate technology Teaching – which involves applying the concepts of open source to instruction using a shared web space as a platform to improve upon learning organizational and management challenges An example of an Opensource courseware is the Java Education Development Initiative JEDI Other examples include Khan Academy and wikiversity At the university level the use of opensourceappropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging the connection between scienceengineering and social benefit This approach has the potential to use university students access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving service learning There are few examples of business information methodologies advice guidance practices using the opensource model although this is another case where the potential is enormous ITIL is close to open source It uses the Cathedral model no mechanism exists for user contribution and the content must be bought for a fee that is small by business consulting standards hundreds of British pounds Various checklists are published by government banks or accounting firms An opensource group emerged in 2012 that is attempting to design a firearm that may be downloaded from the internet and printed on a 3D Printer Calling itself Defense Distributed the group wants to facilitate a working plastic gun that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer Society and culture The rise of opensource culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often copyrighted and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright particularly in the United States and penalties such as those articulated in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA placed on attempts to circumvent antipiracy technologies Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under fairuse doctrines the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners Also the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a chilling effect among cultural practitioners The idea of an opensource culture runs parallel to Free Culture but is substantively different Free culture is a term derived from the free software movement and in contrast to that vision of culture proponents of opensource culture OSC maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods as in the Good life and ends Sites such as ccMixter offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a Creative Commons license The resulting cultural product is then available to download free generally accessible to anyone with an Internet connection Older analog technologies such as the telephone or television have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have Through various technologies such as peertopeer networks and blogs cultural producers can take advantage of vast social networks to distribute their products As opposed to traditional media distribution redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless Technologies such as BitTorrent and Gnutella take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol TCPIP in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution Further information Opensource software movement Government Open politics sometimes known as Opensource politics is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters There is also an alternative conception of the term Opensource politics which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the opensource software movement Opensource governance is similar to opensource politics but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information The South Korean government wants to increase its use of free and opensource software in order to decrease its dependence on proprietary software solutions It plans to make open standards a requirement to allow the government to choose between multiple operating systems and web browsers Koreas Ministry of Science ICT Future Planning is also preparing ten pilots on using opensource software distributions Ethics Opensource ethics is split into two strands Opensource ethics as an ethical school – Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an opensource approach Ess famously even defined the AoIR Research Guidelines as an example of opensource ethics Opensource ethics as a professional body of rules – This is based principally on the computer ethics school studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular Religion Irish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term opensource Hinduism to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition Media Opensource journalism formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking reflecting opensource intelligence a similar term used in military intelligence circles Now opensource journalism commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of online journalism rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist In the December 25 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as user created content and listed alongside more traditional opensource projects such as OpenSolaris and Linux Weblogs or blogs are another significant platform for opensource culture Blogs consist of periodic reverse chronologically ordered posts using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design code or file transfer required While corporations political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression political organizing and socializing Some such as LiveJournal or WordPress utilize opensource software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes Whether the code is open or not this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and represent culture whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate the mutability of blogs makes open sourcing even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere Messageboards are another platform for opensource culture Messageboards also known as discussion boards or forums are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are spammers Other common board features are private messages where users can send messages to one another as well as chat a way to have a real time conversation online and image uploading Some messageboards use phpBB which is a free opensource package Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product movie or CD By removing the cultural middlemen messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas OpenDocument is an open document file format for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents including memos reports and books spreadsheets charts and presentations Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being locked into a single software vendor leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business raises their prices changes their software or changes their licensing terms to something less favorable Opensource movie production is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production a system in which the end result is made available for reuse by others or in which exclusively opensource products are used in the production The 2006 movie Elephants Dream is said to be the worlds first open movie created entirely using opensource technology An opensource documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material footage and other filmic elements both in unedited and edited form similar to crowdsourcing By doing so online contributors become part of the process of creating the film helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary as well as its thematic development The first opensource documentary film is the nonprofit The American Revolution which went into development in 2006 and will examine the role media played in the cultural social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCNFM in Boston The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the nonprofit Filmmakers Collaborative Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age coproduced by the National Film Board of Canada Opensource filmmaking refers to a form of filmmaking that takes a method of idea formation from opensource software but in this case the source for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code It can also refer to a method of filmmaking where the process of creation is open ie a disparate group of contributors at different times contribute to the final piece OpenIPTV is IPTV that is not limited to one recording studio production studio or cast OpenIPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show Education Within the academic community there is discussion about expanding what could be called the intellectual commons analogous to the Creative Commons Proponents of this view have hailed the Connexions Project at Rice University OpenCourseWare project at MIT Eugene Thackers article on opensource DNA the Open Source Cultural Database Salman Khans Khan Academy and Wikipedia as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software Opensource curricula are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used distributed and modified Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an opensource license In the UK the Joint Information Systems Committee JISC has developed a policy on opensource software JISC also funds a development service called OSS Watch which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use contribute to and develop opensource software On March 30 2010 President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act which included 2 billion over four years to fund the TAACCCT program which is described as the largest OER open education resources initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing health energy transportation and IT Innovation communities The principle of sharing predates the opensource movement for example the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century Opensource principles have always been part of the scientific community The sociologist Robert K Merton described the four basic elements of the community—universalism an international perspective communalism sharing information disinterestedness removing ones personal views from the scientific inquiry and organized skepticism requirements of proof and review that accurately describe the scientific community today These principles are in part complemented by US laws focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been open access—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online however most journals do charge a fee either to users or libraries for access The Budapest Open Access Initiative is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet The National Institutes of Health has recently proposed a policy on Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information This policy would provide a free searchable resource of NIHfunded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication The NIHs move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs public access and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access FarmavitaNet is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of opensource pharmaceuticals The project is targeted to development and sharing of knowhow for manufacture of essential and lifesaving medicines It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs It will be limited to generic offpatent medicines with established use By the definition medicinal product have a wellestablished use if is used for at least 15 years with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety In that event the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature Benjamin Franklin was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the Franklin stove bifocals and the lightning rod to the public domain New NGO communities are starting to use the opensource technology as a tool One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members Open innovation is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting RD in a common pool The Eclipse platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network Arts and recreation Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices In 2012 Russian music composer scientist and Russian Pirate Party member Victor Argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera 2032 under free license CCBYNC 30 This opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by Russian label MC Entertainment as a commercial product but then the author changed its status to free In his blog 2 he said that he decided to open raw files including wav midi and other used formats to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against SOPA and PIPA Several Internet resources called 2032 the first opensource musical opera in history Other related movements The following are events and applications that have been developed via the open source community and echo the ideologies of the open source movement Open Education Consortium — an organization composed of various colleges that support open source and share some of their material online This organization headed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology was established to aid in the exchange of open source educational materials Wikipedia — usergenerated online encyclopedia with sister projects in academic areas such as Wikiversity — a community dedicated to the creation and exchange of learning materials Project Gutenberg — prior to the existence of Google Scholar Beta this was the first supplier of electronic books and the very first free library project Synthetic Biology Synthetic Biology is considered the feasibility of the open source movement This new technology is important and exciting because it promises to enable cheap lifesaving new drugs as well as helping to yield biofuels that may help to solve our energy problem Although synthetic biology has not yet come out of its lab stage it has great potential to become industrialized in the near future In order to industrialize open source science there are some scientists who are trying to build their own brand of it Ideologically related movements The open access movement is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement Members of this movement maintain that academic material should be readily available to provide help with “future research assist in teaching and aid in academic purposes” The Open access movement aims to eliminate subscription fees and licensing restrictions of academic materials The free culture movement is a movement that seeks to achieve a culture that engages in collective freedom via freedom of expression free public access to knowledge and information full demonstration of creativity and innovation in various arenas and promotion of citizen liberties Creative Commons is an organization that “develops supports and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity sharing and innovation” It encourages the use of protected properties online for research education and creative purposes in pursuit of a universal access Creative Commons provides an infrastructure through a set of copyright licenses and tools that creates a better balance within the realm of “all rights reserved” properties The Creative Commons license offers a slightly more lenient alternative to “all rights reserved” copyrights for those who do not wish to exclude the use of their material The Zeitgeist Movement is an international social movement that advocates a transition into a sustainable resourcebased economy based on collaboration in which monetary incentives are replaced by commonsbased ones with everyone having access to everything from code to products as in open source everything While its activism and events are typically focused on media and education TZM is a major supporter of open source projects worldwide since they allow for uninhibited advancement of science and technology independent of constraints posed by institutions of patenting and capitalist investment P2P Foundation is an “international organization focused on studying researching documenting and promoting peer to peer practices in a very broad sense” Its objectives incorporate those of the open source movement whose principles are integrated in a larger socioeconomic model See also Free software portal Lists List of commercial opensource applications
