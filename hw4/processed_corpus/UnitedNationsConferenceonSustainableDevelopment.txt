 The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development UNCSD also known as Rio 2012 Rio20 Portuguese pronunciation ˈʁiu ˈmajʒ ˈvĩtʃi or Earth Summit 2012 was the third international conference on sustainable development aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community Hosted by Brazil in Rio de Janeiro from 13 to 22 June 2012 Rio20 was a 20year followup to the 1992 Earth Summit United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED held in the same city and the 10th anniversary of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development WSSD in Johannesburg The tenday megasummit which culminated in a threeday highlevel UN conference was organized by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and included participation from 192 UN member states — including 57 Heads of State and 31 Heads of Government private sector companies NGOs and other groups The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution ARES64236 on 24 December 2009 It was intended to be a highlevel conference including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy Background In 1992 the first conference of its kind the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED commonly referred to as the Rio Conference or Earth Summit succeeded in raising public awareness of the need to integrate environment and development The conference drew 109 heads of state to Rio de Janeiro Brazil to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socioeconomic development The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences including Rio20 and set the global green agenda “The World Conference on Human Rights for example focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit” Major outcomes of the conference include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC —a climatechange agreement that led to the Kyoto Protocol Agenda 21 the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity CBD and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification UNCCD It also created new international institutions among them the Commission on Sustainable Development tasked with the followup to the Rio Conference and led to the reform of the Global Environment Facility Ten years later Earth Summit 2002 informally nicknamed Rio10 was held in Johannesburg South Africa with the goal of again bringing together leaders from government business and NGOs to agree on a range of measures toward similar goals At Rio10 sustainable development was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national regional and international levels There the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies programs and funds was highlighted The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system Major outcomes of that conference include the Johannesburg Declaration and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals Objectives The conference had three objectives Securing renewed political commitment for sustainable development Assessing the progress and implementation gaps in meeting previous commitments Addressing new and emerging challenges Conference themes The official discussions had two main themes How to build a green economy to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty including support for developing countries that will allow them to find a green path for development How to improve international coordination for sustainable development by building an institutional framework Rio20 In the months leading up to the beginning of the conference negotiators held frequent informal consultations at UN headquarters in New York City and in the two weeks before the conference was scheduled to begin they managed to reach consensus on the sensitive language in the then proposed outcome document for the summit Billed as the biggest UN event ever organized—with 15000 soldiers and police guarding about 130 heads of state and government from 192 countries and the more than 45000 individuals gathered in Rio de Janeiro—the 10day megaconference was intended to be a highlevel international gathering organized to redirect and renew global political commitment to the three dimensions of sustainable development economic growth social improvement and environmental protection focusing on reducing poverty while promoting jobs growth clean energy and more fair sustainable uses of resources goals first established at Earth Summit in 1992 The conference centered around Agenda 21 the outcome document from Earth Summit 1992 That document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years The representatives of participating governments gathered in Rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document Rio20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in Agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein and discussing new and emerging issues The UN wanted Rio to endorse a UN green economy roadmap with environmental goals targets and deadlines whereas developing countries preferred establishing new sustainable development goals to better protect the environment guarantee food and power to the poorest and alleviate poverty Rio20 attracted many protests and more than 500 parallel events exhibitions presentations fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention The British online newspaper The Guardian reported that “Downtown Rio de Janeiro was partly shutdown as an estimated 50000 protesters some of whom were naked took to the streets” Participation A few key global leaders—mostly G20 leaders and namely United States President Barack Obama German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister David Cameron—did not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing European sovereigndebt crisis Their collective absence was seen as a reflection of their administrations’ failure to prioritize sustainability issues In not attending the prime minister is sending out a powerful signal that the UK government does not see sustainability as a priority Joan Walley chair of the UK environmental audit committee said to The Guardian Calendar of meetings 1st Preparatory Committee Held from 16–18 May 2010 immediately after the conclusion of the eighteenth session and the first meeting of the nineteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development 1st Intersessional Held from 10–11 January 2011 at UN Headquarters New York the Intersessional

Janeiro Brazil and ended on 15 June 2012 marking the start of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development The talks were held from 20–22 June 2012 in Rio de Janeiro Brazil The conference was expected to draw 50000 participants including delegates environmental activists business leaders and indigenous groups Additionally about 130 heads of state from around the world were expected to be present for the final three days of the summit Outcomes The primary result of the conference was the nonbinding document The Future We Want a 49page work paper In it the heads of state of the 192 governments in attendance renewed their political commitment to sustainable development and declared their commitment to the promotion of a sustainable future The document largely reaffirms previous action plans like Agenda 21 Some important outcomes include the following “The text includes language supporting the development of Sustainable Development Goals SDGs a set of measurable targets aimed at promoting sustainable development globally It is thought that the SDGs will pick up where the Millennium Development Goals leave off and address criticism that the original Goals fail to address the role of the environment in development” The attempt to shore up the UN Environment Programme UNEP in order to make it the “leading global environmental authority” by setting forth eight key recommendations including strengthening its governance through universal membership increasing its financial resources and strengthening its engagement in key UN coordination bodies Nations agreed to explore alternatives to GDP as a measure of wealth that take environmental and social factors into account in an effort to assess and pay for ‘environmental services’ provided by nature such as carbon sequestration and habitat protection Recognition that fundamental changes in the way societies consume and produce are indispensable for achieving global sustainable development” EU officials suggest it could lead to a shift of taxes so workers pay less and polluters and landfill operators pay more The document calls the need to return ocean stocks to sustainable levels “urgent” and calls on countries to develop and implement sciencebased management plans All nations reaffirmed commitments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies In addition to the outcome text there were over 400 voluntary commitments for sustainable development made by Member States At the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment 40 African countries agreed to implement The Future We Want Leaders in attendance

European Commission look at the official photo of the summit Controversies Environmental and Indigenous Rights Activists Activists took initiative at Rio20 by staging numerous loud protests and making their voices heard Numbered in the thousands these activists joined forces to stand up to what they considered exploitation and degradation of the Earth as well as the negation of the rights of indigenous peoples This group is ever more relevant in Brazil as deforestation threatens Amazonian ethnic groups everyday In addition to holding signs and shouting chants the crowds took a theatric route to convey their messages Firstly they poked at Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff claiming she has given in to the global North’s corporate hand Rousseffs controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil and its economy Additionally the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic tearing up of the plenarys negotiated text conveying their disapproval Thousands of nongovernmental organizations NGOs gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio They criticized the draft negotiating text particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy in light of the Fukushima disaster in Japan Organizations such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature as well as members of indigenous communities activists and artists participated The Danish artist Jens Galschiøt the leader of the group AIDOH and the Group 92 used his Freedom to Pollute sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees About 20000 flyers about Freedom to Pollute were distributed during Rio20 and a related television program was produced in Denmark Ahmadinejad Visit to Rio There was some controversy over Irans involvement in the Rio20 conference Iran sent a delegation which included President Ahmadinejad to Rio in June to attend the summit The controversy of Iranian attendance at the summit surrounds the fact that Iran has serious environmental issues which it has refused to address continuing human rights violations and is refusing to cooperate with the IAEA over its contentious nuclear program Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations attended by thousands of people on his arrival in Rio The Iranian delegation were met with protesters waving banners with the slogan “Ahmadinejad go home” on their arrival in Rio
