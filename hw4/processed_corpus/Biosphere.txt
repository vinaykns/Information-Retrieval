 For other uses see Biosphere disambiguation The biosphere also known as the ecosphere is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems The two joined words are bio and sphere It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth a closed system apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the Earth and largely selfregulating By the most general biophysiological definition the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere The biosphere is postulated to have evolved beginning with a process of biopoiesis life created naturally from nonliving matter such as simple organic compounds or biogenesis life created from living matter at least some 35 billion years ago The earliest evidence for life on Earth includes biogenic graphite found in 37 billionyearold metasedimentary rocks from Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 348 billionyearold sandstone from Western Australia More recently in 2015 remains of biotic life were found in 41 billionyearold rocks in Western Australia In 2017 putative fossilized microorganisms or microfossils were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec Canada that were as old as 428 billion years the oldest record of life on earth suggesting an almost instantaneous emergence of life after ocean formation 44 billion years ago and not long after the formation of the Earth 454 billion years ago According to one of the researchers If life arose relatively quickly on Earth then it could be common in the universe In a general sense biospheres are any closed selfregulating systems containing ecosystems This includes artificial biospheres such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS3 and potentially ones on other planets or moons Origin and use of the term The term biosphere was coined by geologist Eduard Suess in 1875 which he defined as the place on Earths surface where life dwells While the concept has a geological origin it is an indication of the effect of both Charles Darwin and Matthew F Maury on the Earth sciences The biospheres ecological context comes from the 1920s see Vladimir I Vernadsky preceding the 1935 introduction of the term ecosystem by Sir Arthur Tansley see ecology history Vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere It is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy geophysics meteorology biogeography evolution geology geochemistry hydrology and generally speaking all life and Earth sciences Narrow definition Geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms the biomass or biota as referred to by biologists and ecologists In this sense the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model the other three being geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere When these four component spheres are combined into one system it is known as the Ecosphere This term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet The Second International Conference on Closed Life Systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and models of Earths biosphere ie artificial Earthlike biospheres Others may include the creation of artificial nonEarth biospheres—for example humancentered biospheres or a native Martian biosphere—as part of the topic of biospherics Extent of Earths biosphere Life timeline view • discuss • edit 4500 — – 4000 — –

Nature timeline Every part of the planet from the polar ice caps to the equator features life of some kind Recent advances in microbiology have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the Earths terrestrial surface and that the total mass of microbial life in socalled uninhabitable zones may in biomass exceed all animal and plant life on the surface The actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure Birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1800 m 5900 ft 11 mi and fish live as much as 8372 m 27467 ft 5202 mi underwater in the Puerto Rico Trench There are more extreme examples for life on the planet Rüppells vulture has been found at altitudes of 11300 m 37100 ft 70 mi barheaded geese migrate at altitudes of at least 8300 m 27200 ft 52 mi yaks live at elevations as high as 5400 m 17700 ft 34 mi above sea level mountain goats live up to 3050 m 10010 ft 190 mi Herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens grasses and herbs Life forms live in every part of the Earths biosphere including soil hot springs inside rocks at least 19 km 12 mi deep underground the deepest parts of the ocean and at least 64 km 40 mi high in the atmosphere Microorganisms under certain test conditions have been observed to thrive in the vacuum of outer space The total amount of soil and subsurface bacterial carbon is estimated as 5 × 10 g or the weight of the United Kingdom The mass of prokaryote microorganisms—which includes bacteria and archaea but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms—may be as much as 08 trillion tons of carbon of the total biosphere mass estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons Barophilic marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10000 m 33000 ft 62 mi in the Mariana Trench the deepest spot in the Earths oceans In fact singlecelled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the Mariana Trench by the Challenger Deep at depths of 11034 m 36201 ft 6856 mi Other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580 m 1900 ft 036 mi below the sea floor under 2590 m 8500 ft 161 mi of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States as well as 2400 m 7900 ft 15 mi beneath the seabed off Japan Culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than 5000 m 16000 ft 31 mi into the Earths crust in Sweden from rocks between 65–75 °C 149–167 °F Temperature increases with increasing depth into the Earths crust The rate at which the temperature increases depends on many factors including type of crust continental vs oceanic rock type geographic location etc The greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122 °C 252 °F Methanopyrus kandleri Strain 116 and it is likely that the limit of life in the deep biosphere is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth On 20 August 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800 m 2600 ft 050 mi below the ice of Antarctica According to one researcher You can find microbes everywhere — theyre extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are Our biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna On land biomes are separated primarily by latitude Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator Specific biospheres For this list if a word is followed by a number it is usually referring to a specific system or number Thus Biosphere 1 the planet Earth

extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical The rare Earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare save ones composed of microbial life only On the other hand Earth analogs may be quite numerous at least in the Milky Way galaxy Three of the planets discovered orbiting TRAPPIST1 could possibly contain biospheres Given limited understanding of abiogenesis it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres It is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future for example on Mars The process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of Earths biosphere is called terraforming See also Environment portal Ecology portal Earth sciences portal Sustainable development portal Abiogenesis Biosphere reserve
