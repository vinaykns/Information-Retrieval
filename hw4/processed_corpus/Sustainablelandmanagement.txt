 Sustainable land management SLM refers to practices and technologies that aim to integrate the management of land water biodiversity and other environmental resources to meet human needs while ensuring the longterm sustainability of ecosystem services and livelihoods The term sustainable land management is used for example in regional planning and soil or environmental protection as well as in property and estate management Examples The World Bank defines sustainable land management as a process in a charged environment between environmental protection and the guarantee claim of ecosystem services on the one hand On the other hand it is about productivity of agriculture and forestry with respect to demographic growth and increasing pressure in land use SLM is defined as a knowledgebased procedure that helps integrate land water biodiversity and environmental management including input and output externalities to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growing population Improper land management can lead to land degradation and a significant reduction in the productive and service biodiversity niches hydrology carbon sequestration functions of watersheds and landscapes — The World Bank The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE applies the term in a much wider context Besides agriculture and forestry they include the mineral extraction sector property and estate management Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect It covers all activities concerned with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective It can include farming mineral extraction property and estate management and the physical planning of towns and the countryside In the course of national politics and programmes few European states use the terminology sustainable land management Here Australia and New Zealand are to be mentioned as both countries have agreed on sustainable land management with respect to climate change as part of their government programmes In the European context the definition of the European Network for Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities LUMASEC may be used as a reference It emphasizes the inter and transdisciplinary cooperation on sustainable land management As management is the human activity meaning the action of people working together in the aim to accomplish desired goals land use management is a process of managing use and development of land in which spatial sectororiented and temporary aspects of urban policy are coordinated Resources of land are used for different purposes which may produce conflicts and competitions and land use management has to see those purposes in an integrated way Therefore land management covers the debate about norms and visions driving the policymaking sectorbased planning both in the strategic and more operative time spans spatial integration of sectoral issues decisionmaking budgeting implementation of plans and decisions and the monitoring of results and evaluation of impacts Research examples Since 2010 the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF funds an international research program on sustainable land management Module A of the program investigates interactions between land management climate change and ecosystem services It includes projects operating in South America Africa Europe Central Asia and South Asia Module B seeks innovative system solutions in 13 projects with a Central European focus Furthermore the Economics of Land Degradation ELD Initiative seeks to establish a cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management highlighting its economic benefits This economic analysis will enable decision makers to take appropriate measures combat land degradation globally Additionally the Initiative supports regional case studies focusing on Africa and Central Asia See also Holistic management Permaculture References External links Sustainable Development portal Environment portal Sustainable land management – website of the BMBFFunding Holistic Management International Global Land Project website – The Global Land Project is a joint research project for land systems for the International GeosphereBiosphere Programme IGBP and the International Human Dimensions Programme IHDP URBACT website website of the BMBFFunding project REFINA Research for the Reduction of Land Consumption and for Sustainable Land Management httpwwwnachhaltigewaldwirtschaftde Sustainable Forestry website of the National Research Programme Sustainable Forestry of the BMBF The Economics of Land Degradation ELD Initiative
