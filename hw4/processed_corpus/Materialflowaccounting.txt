 Material flow accounting MFA is the study of material flows on a national or regional scale It is therefore sometimes also referred to as regional national or economywide material flow analysis Introduction Material flow accounting provides economywide data on material use Through international standardization this data has become reliable and comparable across countries Increasingly the data are also being made available in medium to longterm time series allowing for the analysis of past trends as well as potential future developments Material flow accounts provide information on the material inputs into the changes in material stock within and the material outputs in the form of exports to other economies or discharges to the environment of an economy Material flow accounting can be used in national planning especially for scarce resources and also allows for forecasting The method can be used to assess environmental burdens associated with the economic activities of a nation and to determine how material intensive an economy is The principle concept underlying MFA is a simple model of this interrelation between the economy and the environment in which the economy is an embedded subsystem of the environment Similar to living beings this subsystem is dependent on a constant throughput of materials and energy Raw materials water and air are extracted from the natural system as inputs transformed into products and finally retransferred to the natural system as outputs waste and emissions In order to highlight the similarity to natural metabolic processes the terms “industrial” or “societal” metabolism have been introduced In MFA studies for a region or on a national level the flows of materials between the natural environment and the economy are analyzed and quantified on a physical level The focus may be on individual substances eg Cadmium flows specific materials or bulk material flows eg steel and steel scrap flows within an economy Researchers in this field are organized in the SocioEconomic Metabolism SEM section of the International Society for Industrial Ecology ISIE Statistics related to material flow accounting are usually compiled by national statistical offices using economic agricultural and trade statistics measuring the exchange of material between different products available in an economy Scope and Indicators Aside from calculating the net additions to stock NAS as a balancing item flows within the economy are not considered advances are currently being made in the field of dynamic stock modelling MFA covers all solid gaseous and liquid materials mobilized by humans or by their livestock with the exception of bulk water and air The unit of measurement is most commonly metric tonnes per year ta Flows are distinguished by whether they are extracted domestically domestic extraction DE or are trade flows imports or exports Materials are most commonly grouped according to four main material categories biomass fossil energy carriers metals and nonmetallic minerals The former category may be further differentiated by type of use into industrial and construction minerals It is very important to note that MFA seeks to provide a complete picture of an economy’s material use so that materials are included in these accounts irrespective of whether or not they have direct market value The most prominent nonmarket flows covered by MFA are grazed biomass and used crop residues as well as waste rock extracted during mining activities In 2010 these material flows accounted for 21 of global extraction The data collected in MFA is used to calculate several different standardized indicators Direct Material Input DMI is a measure of the total material inputs into an economy and is calculated as the sum of domestic extraction DE and imports The Physical Trade Balance PTB is a measure of netimports and is calculated as the difference between imports and exports Reflecting that material and money flow in opposite directions during trade this is a contrast to the monetary trade balance which calculates netexports Domestic Material Consumption DMC is a measure of apparent consumption and calculated from domestic extraction plus imports minus exports or DE plus PTB Economywide MFA is a satellite system to the system of national accounts and provides a rich empirical database for analytical studies More information on how the statistics are collected under what legal framework and how they are defined is available on Economywide material flow accounts In addition the following indicators are may be used in material flow accounting Total Material Requirement TMR includes the domestic extraction of resources minerals fossil fuels biomass the indirect flows caused by and associated with the domestic extraction called Hidden Flows and the imports Hidden Flows are materials that are extracted or moved but do not enter the economy According to OECD the displacement of environmental assets without absorption into the economic sphere such as overburden from mining operations Domestic Processed Output DPO is defined by the OECD as the total mass of materials which have been used in the national economy before flowing into the environment These flows occur at the processing manufacturing use and final disposal stages of the economic productionconsumption chain Total Domestic Output TDO includes the domestic processed output DPO plus the hidden flows associated with the domestic production Raw Material Consumption RMC includes the raw materials that are embodied in traded products eg metal ores from which metals have been extracted RMC does not include hidden flows RMC is most commonly calculated via environmentally extended inputoutput analysis See also Business and
