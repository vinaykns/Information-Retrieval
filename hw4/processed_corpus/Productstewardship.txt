 Product stewardship is where environmental health and safety protection centers on the product itself and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental health and safety impacts For manufacturers this includes planning for and if necessary paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life This may be achieved in part by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances to be more durable reusable and recyclable and to make products from recycled materials For retailers and consumers this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an endoflife product Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process It is considered a prerequisite to a strict service economy interpretation of fictional national legal commodity and product relationships The most familiar example is the containerdeposit legislation A fee is paid to buy the bottle separately from the fee to buy what it contains If the bottle is returned the fee is returned and the supplier must return the bottle for reuse or recycling If not the collected fee can be used to pay for landfill or litter control measures Also since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving This is quite common for instance among homeless people in US cities However the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires When purchasing paint or tires in many places one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become In some countries such as Germany law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction production distribution use and waste of a product and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally In the United States the issue has been confronted via class action lawsuits that attempt to hold companies liable for the environmental impact of their products Thus far such as litigation or proposed accounting reforms such as full cost accounting have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of academe and corporate public relations derisively referred to as greenwashing The demandside approach ethical consumerism supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship Extended producer responsibility Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with Extended producer responsibility a similar concept However there are distinct differences between the two as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for endoflife products from the government to the manufacturers Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the lifecycle of the product This includes not only the manufacturers but also the retailers consumers and recyclers as well See also Extended producer responsibility Sustainability Recycling References External links Product Stewardship Society Product Policy Institute The Product Stewardship Institute Northwest Product Stewardship Council Container Recycling Institute Global Product Stewardship Council
