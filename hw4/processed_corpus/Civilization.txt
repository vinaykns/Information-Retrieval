 This article is about human society For other uses see Civilization disambiguation A civilization UK and US or civilisation British English variant is any complex society characterized by urban development social stratification symbolic communication forms typically writing systems and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other sociopoliticoeconomic characteristics including centralization the domestication of both humans and other organisms specialization of labour culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism monumental architecture taxation societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice and expansionism Historically a civilization was a socalled advanced culture in contrast to more supposedly primitive cultures In this broad sense a civilization contrasts with noncentralized tribal societies including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists egalitarian horticultural subsistence neolithic societies or huntergatherers As an uncountable noun civilization also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized urbanized stratified structure Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations which engage in intensive agriculture mining smallscale manufacture and trade Civilization concentrates power extending human control over the rest of nature including over other human beings The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally associated with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state formation a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite The earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in the Middle East for example at Göbekli Tepe from about 9130 BCE and later in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins in China for example the Pengtoushan culture from 7500 BCE and later spread Similar precivilized neolithic revolutions also began independently from 7000 BCE in such places as northwestern South America the Norte Chico civilization and Mesoamerica These were among the six civilizations worldwide that arose independently Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10000 BCE with civilizations developing from 6500 years ago This area has been identified as having inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel the development of cursive script mathematics astronomy and agriculture The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentarism the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors The transition from complex cultures to civilizations while still disputed seems to be associated with the development of state structures in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class who practised human sacrifice Towards the end of the Neolithic period various elitist Chalcolithic civilizations began to rise in various cradles from around 3300 BCE Chalcolithic civilizations as defined above also developed in PreColumbian Americas and despite an early start in Egypt Axum and Kush much later in Iron Age subSaharan Africa The Bronze Age collapse was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE during which a number of new civilizations emerged culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which German psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age and which he claimed was a critical transitional phase leading to Classical civilization A major technological and cultural transition to modernity began approximately 1500 CE in Western Europe and from this beginning new approaches to science and law spread rapidly around the world incorporating earlier cultures into the industrial and technological civilization of the present History of the concept The English word civilization comes from the 16thcentury French civilisé civilized from Latin civilis civil related to civis citizen and civitas city The fundamental treatise is Norbert Eliass The Civilizing Process 1939 which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the Early Modern period In The Philosophy of Civilization 1923 Albert Schweitzer outlines two opinions one purely material and the other material and ethical He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress Adjectives like civility developed in the mid16th century The abstract noun civilization meaning civilized condition came in the 1760s again from French The first known use in French is in 1757 by Victor Riqueti marquis de Mirabeau and the first use in English is attributed to Adam Ferguson who in his 1767 Essay on the History of Civil Society wrote Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness in the active pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment In the late 1700s and early 1800s during the French revolution civilization was used in the singular never in the plural and meant the progress of humanity as a whole This is still the case in French The use of civilizations as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century but has become much more common in the later 20th century sometimes just meaning culture itself in origin an uncountable noun made countable in the context of ethnography Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a medieval civilization which in Eliass sense would have been an oxymoron Already in the 18th century civilization was not always seen as an improvement One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau particularly his work about education Emile Here civilization being more rational and socially driven is not fully in accord with human nature and human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity see noble savage From this a new approach was developed especially in Germany first by Johann Gottfried Herder and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche This sees cultures as natural organisms not defined by conscious rational deliberative acts but a kind of prerational folk spirit Civilization in contrast though more rational and more successful in material progress is unnatural and leads to vices of social life such as guile hypocrisy envy and avarice In World War II Leo Strauss having fled Germany argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and German militarism and nihilism Characteristics Social scientists such as V Gordon Childe have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence types of livelihood settlement patterns forms of government social stratification economic systems literacy and other cultural traits Andrew Nikiforuk argues that civilizations relied on shackled human muscle It took the energy of slaves to plant crops clothe emperors and build cities and considers slavery to be a common feature of premodern civilizations All civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization irrigation and crop rotation It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare Grain surpluses have been especially important because they can be stored for a long time A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living early civilizations included soldiers artisans priests and priestesses and other people with specialized careers A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity a defining trait of civilizations However in some places huntergatherers have had access to food surpluses such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies The word civilization is sometimes simply defined as living in cities Nonfarmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade Compared with other societies civilizations have a more complex political structure namely the state State societies are more stratified than other societies there is a greater difference among the social classes The ruling class normally concentrated in the cities has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government or bureaucracy Morton Fried a conflict theorist and Elman Service an integration theorist have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality This system of classification contains four categories Huntergatherer bands which are generally egalitarian Horticulturalpastoral societies in which there are generally two inherited social classes chief and commoner Highly stratified structures or chiefdoms with several inherited social classes king noble freemen serf and slave Civilizations with complex social hierarchies and organized institutional governments Economically civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people Some people also acquire landed property or private ownership of the land Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food they must trade their goods and services for food in a market system or receive food through the levy of tribute redistributive taxation tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the population Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy supplemented by limited barter systems By the early Iron Age contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions To oversimplify in a village the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer In a city the potter may need a new roof the roofer may need new shoes the cobbler may need new horseshoes the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites Writing developed first by people in Sumer is considered a hallmark of civilization and appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records Like money writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other However writing is not always necessary for civilization The Inca civilization of the Andes did not use writing at all but it uses a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead the Quipus and it still functioned as a civilized society Aided by their division of labour and central government planning civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits These include organized religion development in the arts and countless new advances in science and technology Through history successful civilizations have spread taking over more and more territory and assimilating more and more previouslyuncivilized people Nevertheless some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day These cultures are called by some primitive a term that is regarded by others as pejorative Primitive implies in some way that a culture is first Latin primus that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity though this has been demonstrated not to be true Specifically as all of todays cultures are contemporaries todays socalled primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized Anthropologists today use the term nonliterate to describe these peoples Civilization has been spread by colonization invasion religious conversion the extension of bureaucratic control and trade and by introducing agriculture and writing to nonliterate peoples Some noncivilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour But civilization is also spread by the technical material and social dominance that civilization engenders Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities the territorial extensions of its power the complexity of its division of labour and the carrying capacity of its urban centres Secondary elements include a developed transportation system writing standardized measurement currency contractual and tortbased legal systems art architecture mathematics scientific understanding metallurgy political structures and organized religion Traditionally polities that managed to achieve notable military ideological and economic power defined themselves as civilized as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence—calling the latter barbarians savages and primitives In a modernday context civilized people have been contrasted with indigenous people or tribal societies Cultural identity Further information Cultural area Civilization can also refer to the culture of a complex society not just the society itself Every society civilization or not has a specific set of ideas and customs and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures including a statebased decision making apparatus a literature professional art architecture organized religion and complex customs of education coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures sometimes assimilating them into the civilization a classic example being Chinese civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea Japan and Vietnam Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions The civilization in which someone lives is that persons broadest cultural identity Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units Early twentiethcentury philosopher Oswald Spengler uses the German word Kultur culture for what many call a civilization Spengler believes a civilizations coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol Cultures experience cycles of birth life decline and death often supplanted by a potent new culture formed around a compelling new cultural symbol Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable This unified culture concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian Arnold J Toynbee in the midtwentieth century Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multivolume A Study of History which traced the rise and in most cases the decline of 21 civilizations and five arrested civilizations Civilizations generally declined and fell according to Toynbee because of the failure of a creative minority through moral or religious decline to meet some important challenge rather than mere economic or environmental causes Samuel P Huntington defines civilization as the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species Huntingtons theories about civilizations are discussed below Complex systems Another group of theorists making use of systems theory looks at a civilization as a complex system ie a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from preurban cultures and are defined by the economic political military diplomatic social and cultural interactions among them Any organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large organization Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities including economic relations cultural exchanges and politicaldiplomaticmilitary relations These spheres often occur on different scales For example trade networks were until the nineteenth century much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres Extensive trade routes including the Silk Road through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman Empire Persian Empire India and China were well established 2000 years ago when these civilizations scarcely shared any political diplomatic military or cultural relations The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the ancient world During the Uruk period Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt Mesopotamia Iran and Afghanistan Resin found later in the Royal Tombs of Ur it is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single world system a process known as globalization Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically politically and even culturally interdependent in many ways There is debate over when this integration began and what sort of integration – cultural technological economic political or militarydiplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and militarydiplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the Central Civilization around 1500 BCE Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization integrating the Americas Australia China and Japan by the nineteenth century According to Wilkinson civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous like the Central Civilization or homogeneous like the Japanese civilization What Huntington calls the clash of civilizations might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization Others point to the Crusades as the first step in globalization The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism History Development of theories on the origins of civilization Historically civilizations were assumed by writers such as Aristotle to be the natural state of humanity so no origin for the Greek polis was considered to be needed The Sumerian King List for instance sees the origin of their civilization as descending from heaven However the great age of maritime discovery exposed the states of Western Europe to huntergatherer and simple horticultural cultures that were not civilized To explain the differences observed early theorists turned to racist theories of cultural superiority theories of geographic determinism or accidents of culture After the second world war these theories were rejected on various grounds and other explanations sought Four schools have developed in the modern period Theories of voluntary development Theories of coercive militarism Carnieros theory of environmental circumscription Claessons Complex Interaction Model CIM Early civilizations Further information Prehistory and Cradle of Civilization The Neolithic Era and the transition to Civilization Main article Neolithic The process of sedentarization is first thought to have occurred around 12000 BCE in the Levant region of southwest Asia though other regions around the world soon followed The emergence of civilization is generally associated with the Neolithic or Agricultural Revolution which occurred in various locations between 8000 and 5000 BCE specifically in southwesternsouthern Asia northerncentral Africa and Central America At first the Neolithic was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement eventually compelling the settlement itself to move In major semiarid river valleys annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year with the result that population densities could rise significantly This encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat but also for milk wool manure and pulling ploughs and carts—a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene The 82 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 59 Kiloyear Interpluvial saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts This climate change shifted the costbenefit ratio of endemic violence between communities which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities associated with the first civilizations This urban revolution marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferrable surpluses which helped economies and cities develop It was associated with the state monopoly of violence the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare rapid

the prevalent use of iron The early period of the age is characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel The adoption of such material coincided with other changes in society including differing agricultural practices religious beliefs and artistic styles The Iron Age as an archaeological term indicates the condition as to civilization and culture of a people using iron as the material for their cutting tools and weapons The Iron Age is the third principal period of the threeage system created by Christian Thomsen 1788–1865 for classifying ancient societies and prehistoric stages of progress Karl Jaspers the German historical philosopher proposed that the ancient civilizations were affected greatly by an Axial Age in the period between 800 BCE–200 BCE during which a series of male sages prophets religious reformers and philosophers from China India Iran Israel and Greece changed the direction of civilizations William Hardy McNeill proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the closure of the oecumene and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean associated with the spread of coinage larger empires and new religions This view has recently been championed by Christopher ChaseDunn and other world systems theorists Africa Kush Axum Nok IgboUkwu East Asia civilizations

monopolizing the use of violence It was also linked with the spread of coinage and monetary economies which had the effect of dissolving the previous local community traditions The rise of the

generally ended in one of two ways either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization eg As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek and subsequently Roman civilizations or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form as happens in what are called Dark Ages There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization Some focus on historical examples and others on general theory Ibn Khaldūns Muqaddimah influenced theories of the analysis growth and decline of the Islamic civilization He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse Edward Gibbons work The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was a wellknown and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 CE For Gibbon The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness Prosperity ripened the principle of decay the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight The story of the ruin is simple and obvious and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so longGibbon Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire 2nd ed vol 4 ed by J B Bury London 1909 pp 173–174Chapter XXXVIII Reign Of ClovisPart VI General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West Theodor Mommsen in his History of Rome Mommsen suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of genesis growth senescence collapse and decay Oswald Spengler in his Decline of the West rejected Petrarchs chronological division and suggested that there had been only eight mature civilizations Growing cultures he argued tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations which expand and ultimately collapse with democratic forms of government ushering in plutocracy and ultimately imperialism Arnold J Toynbee in his A Study of History suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations including a small number of arrested civilizations and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural elite became a parasitic elite leading to the rise of internal and external proletariats Joseph Tainter in The Collapse of Complex Societies suggested that there were diminishing returns to complexity due to which as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE Jared Diamond in his 2005 book Collapse How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures environmental damage such as deforestation and soil erosion climate change dependence upon longdistance trade for needed resources increasing levels of internal and external violence such as war or invasion and societal responses to internal and environmental problems Peter Turchin in his Historical Dynamics and Andrey Korotayev et al in their Introduction to Social Macrodynamics Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations For example the basic logic of Turchins fiscaldemographic model can be outlined as follows during the initial phase of a sociodemographic cycle we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption which leads not only to relatively high population growth rates but also to relatively high rates of surplus production As a result during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems the taxes are quite easily collectible and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues During the intermediate phase the increasing overpopulation leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes and state revenues stop growing whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state As a result during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems During the final precollapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production the surplus production further decreases state revenues shrink but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing though with lower and lower rates population Eventually this leads to famines epidemics state breakdown and demographic and civilization collapse Peter Turchin Historical Dynamics Princeton University Press 2003121–127 Andrey Korotayev et al Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends Moscow Russian Academy of Sciences 2006 Peter Heather argues in his book The Fall of the Roman Empire a New History of Rome and the Barbarians that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a much more sophisticated and dangerous adversary The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and reequip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field led to the dismemberment of the Empire Although this argument is specific to Rome it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians to the Han and Tang dynasties of China to the Muslim Abbasid Caliphate and others Bryan WardPerkins in his book The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1000 years Similar Dark Age collapses are seen with the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern Mediterranean the collapse of the Maya on Easter Island and elsewhere Arthur Demarest argues in Ancient Maya The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology paleoecology and epigraphy that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic complex events including loss of soil fertility drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms which began a spiral of decline and decay He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today Jeffrey A McNeely has recently suggested that A review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to overexploit their forests and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the overexploiting society Thomas HomerDixon in The Upside of Down Catastrophe Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization considers that the fall in the energy return on investments the energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations The degree of social complexity is associated strongly he suggests with the amount of disposable energy environmental economic and technological systems allow When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse Feliks Koneczny in his work On the Plurality of Civilizations calls his study the science on civilizations Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a biological life span There still exist two ancient civilizations—BrahminHindu and Chinese—which are not ready to fall any time soon Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it One of Konecznys claims in his study on civilizations is that a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways without falling into what he calls an abcivilized state as in abnormal He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital they will be in an existential combat imposing its own method of organizing social life upon the other Absorbing alien method of organizing social life that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition Future See also Global catastrophic risk Political scientist Samuel Huntington has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a clash of civilizations According to Huntington conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between nationstates and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries These views have been strongly challenged by others like Edward Said Muhammed Asadi and Amartya Sen Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris have argued that the true clash of civilizations between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the Wests more liberal sexual values rather than a difference in political ideology although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of true democracy In Identity and Violence Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed civilization defined by religion and culture only He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences Cultural Historian Morris Berman suggests in Dark Ages America the End of Empire that in the corporate consumerist United States the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism territorial and economic expansion and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable Politically associated with overreach and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowedout economy is physically socially economically and politically impossible Although developed in much more depth Bermans thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner Jane Jacobs who argues that five pillars of US culture that are in serious decay community and family higher education the effective practice of science taxation and government and the selfregulation of the learned professions The corrosion of these pillars Jacobs argues is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor Some environmental scientists also see the world entering a Planetary Phase of Civilization characterized by a shift away from independent disconnected nationstates to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions environmental challenges economic systems and consciousness In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption the Global scenario group used scenario analysis to arrive at three archetypal futures Barbarization in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown Conventional Worlds in which market forces or Policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices and a Great Transition in which either the sum of fragmented EcoCommunalism movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new sustainability paradigm Cultural critic and author Derrick Jensen argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful unsustainable and selfdestructive fashion Defending his definition both linguistically and historically he defines civilization as a culture that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities with cities defined as people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life This need for civilizations to import ever more resources he argues stems from their overexploitation and diminution of their own local resources Therefore civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and to maintain these highly militarized hierarchically structured and coercionbased cultures and lifestyles The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist see also Civilizations and the
