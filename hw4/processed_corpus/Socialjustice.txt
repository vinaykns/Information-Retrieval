 For the early20thcentury periodical see Social Justice periodical Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth opportunities for personal activity and social privileges In Western as well as in older Asian cultures the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society In the current global grassroots movements for social justice the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility the creation of safety nets and economic justice Social justice assigns rights and duties in the institutions of society which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation The relevant institutions often include taxation social insurance public health public school public services labour law and regulation of markets to ensure fair distribution of wealth and equal opportunity Interpretations that relate justice to a reciprocal relationship to society are mediated by differences in cultural traditions some of which emphasize the individual responsibility toward society and others the equilibrium between access to power and its responsible use Hence social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures such as Bartolomé de las Casas in philosophical debates about differences among human beings in efforts for gender racial and social equality for advocating justice for migrants prisoners the environment and the physically and mentally disabled While the concept of social justice can be traced through the theology of Augustine of Hippo and the philosophy of Thomas Paine the term social justice became used explicitly from the 1840s A Jesuit priest named Luigi Taparelli is typically credited with coining the term and it spread during the revolutions of 1848 with the work of Antonio RosminiSerbati In the late industrial revolution progressive American legal scholars began to use the term more particularly Louis Brandeis and Roscoe Pound From the early 20th century it was also embedded in international law and institutions the preamble to establish the International Labour Organization recalled that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice In the later 20th century social justice was made central to the philosophy of the social contract primarily by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice 1971 In 1993 the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action treats social justice as a purpose of the human rights education History Main articles Social contract Justice Corrective justice and Distributive justice The different concepts of justice as discussed in ancient Western philosophy were typically centered upon the community Plato wrote in The Republic that it would be an ideal state that every member of the community must be assigned to the class for which he finds himself best fitted In an article for JNV University author DR Bhandari says Justice is for Plato at once a part of human virtue and the bond which joins man together in society It is the identical quality that makes good and social Justice is an order and duty of the parts of the soul it is to the soul as health is to the body Plato says that justice is not mere strength but it is a harmonious strength Justice is not the right of the stronger but the effective harmony of the whole All moral conceptions revolve about the good of the wholeindividual as well as social Aristotle believed rights existed only between free people and the law should take account in the first instance of relations of inequality in which individuals are treated in proportion to their worth and only secondarily of relations of equality Reflecting this time when slavery and subjugation of women was typical ancient views of justice tended to reflect the rigid class systems that still prevailed On the other hand for the privileged groups strong concepts of fairness and the community existed Distributive justice was said by Aristotle to require that people were distributed goods and assets according to their merit Socrates through Platos dialogue Crito is attributed with developing the idea of a social contract whereby people ought to follow the rules of a society and accept its burdens because they have accepted its benefits During the Middle Ages religious scholars particularly such as Thomas Aquinas continued discussion of justice in various ways but ultimately connected being a good citizen to the purpose of serving God After the Renaissance and Reformation the modern concept of social justice as developing human potential began to emerge through the work of a series of authors Baruch Spinoza in On the Improvement of the Understanding 1677 contended that the one true aim of life should be to acquire a human character much more stable than ones own and to achieve this pitch of perfection The chief good is that he should arrive together with other individuals if possible at the possession of the aforesaid character During the enlightenment and responding to the French and American Revolutions Thomas Paine similarly wrote in The Rights of Man 1792 society should give genius a fair and universal chance and so the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions The first modern usage of the specific term social justice is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s including the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in Civiltà Cattolica based on the work of St Thomas Aquinas He argued that rival capitalist and socialist theories based on subjective Cartesian thinking undermined the unity of society present in Thomistic metaphysics as neither were sufficiently concerned with moral philosophy Writing in 1861 the influential British philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill stated in Utilitarianism his view that Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it that is who have deserved equally well absolutely This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice towards which all institutions and the efforts of all virtuous citizens should be made in the utmost degree to converge In the later 19th and early 20th century social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy particularly in the work of John Dewey Roscoe Pound and Louis Brandeis One of the prime concerns was the Lochner era decisions of the US Supreme Court to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement such as the eighthour day or the right to join a trade union After the First World War the founding document of the International Labour Organization took up the same terminology in its preamble stating that peace can be established only if it is based on social justice From this point the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse In the late 20th century a number of liberal and conservative thinkers notably Friedrich von Hayek rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything or meant too many things However the concept remained highly influential particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as John Rawls Contemporary theory Philosophical perspectives Cosmic values Hunter Lewis work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for conservation as a key premise in social justice His manifesto on sustainability ties the continued thriving of human life to real conditions the environment supporting that life and associates injustice with the detrimental effects of unintended consequences of human actions Quoting classical Greek thinkers like Epicurus on the good of pursuing happiness Hunter also cites ornithologist naturalist and philosopher Alexander Skutch in his book Moral Foundations The common feature which unites the activities most consistently forbidden by the moral codes of civilized peoples is that by their very nature they cannot be both habitual and enduring because they tend to destroy the conditions which make them possible Pope Benedict XVI cites Teilhard de Chardin in a vision of the cosmos as a living host embracing an understanding of ecology that includes humanitys relationship to others that pollution affects not just the natural world but interpersonal relations as well Cosmic harmony justice and peace are closely interrelated If you want to cultivate peace protect creation John Rawls Main article John Rawls Political philosopher John Rawls draws on the utilitarian insights of Bentham and Mill the social contract ideas of John Locke and the categorical imperative ideas of Kant His first statement of principle was made in A Theory of Justice where he proposed that Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others A deontological proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in absolutist terms His views are definitively restated in Political Liberalism where society is seen as a fair system of cooperation over time from one generation to the next All societies have a basic structure of social economic and political institutions both formal and informal In testing how well these elements fit and work together Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding Obviously not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable Rawls constructed an argument for a twostage process to determine a citizens hypothetical agreement The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes and to that extent X holds these powers as a trustee for the citizen X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate The citizen therefore is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way This applies to one person who represents a small group eg the organiser of a social event setting a dress code as equally as it does to national governments which are ultimate trustees holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries Governments that fail to provide for welfare of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the lawmaking powers of governments Rawls asserted that There is a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold — to some extent the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome According to Rawls the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are Freedom of thought Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion philosophy and morality Political liberties eg representative democratic institutions freedom of speech and the press and freedom of assembly Freedom of association Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person namely freedom from slavery freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose ones occupation and Rights and liberties covered by the rule of law Thomas Pogge Thomas Pogges arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable Thomas argues that social institutions have a negative duty that means that their duty is to not harm the poor Pogge speaks of Institutional Cosmopolitanism and assigns responsibility to institutional schemes for deficits of human rights An example given is slavery and third parties A third party should not recognize or enforce slavery The institutional order should be held responsible only for deprivations of human rights that it establishes or authorizes The current institutional design systematically harms developing economies by enabling corporate tax evasion illicit financial flows corruption trafficking of people and weapons as a few examples Joshua Cohen disputes his claims based on the fact that some poor countries have done well in spite of the current institutional design Elizabeth Kahn argues that some of these responsibilities should apply globally United Nations The United Nations’ 2006 document Social Justice in an Open World The Role of the United Nations states that Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth The term social justice was seen by the UN as a substitute for the protection of human rights and first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s At the initiative of the Soviet Union and with the support of developing countries the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development adopted in 1969 The same document reports From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence repression and chaos The report concludes Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent redistributive policies conceived and implemented by public agencies The same UN document offers a concise history The notion of social justice is relatively new None of history’s great philosophers—not Plato or Aristotle or Confucius or Averroes or even Rousseau or Kant—saw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist exploitation of labour and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid1800s social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists By the midtwentieth century the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world Religious perspectives Hinduism The presentday Jāti hierarchy is undergoing changes for a variety of reasons including social justice which is a politically popular stance in democratic India Institutionalized affirmative action has promoted this The disparity and wide inequalities in social behaviour of the jātis – exclusive endogamous communities centred on traditional occupations – has led to various reform movements in Hinduism While legally outlawed the caste system remains strong in practice Islam The Quran contains numerous references to elements of social justice For example one of Islams Five Pillars is Zakāt or almsgiving Charity and assistance to the poor – concepts central to social justice – are and have historically been important parts of the Islamic faith In Muslim history Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyads The Shia believe that the return of the Mahdi will herald in the messianic age of justice and the Mahdi along with the Isa Jesus will end plunder torture oppression and discrimination For the Muslim Brotherhood the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of consumerism and communism The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work However the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need It held that zakat almsgiving was not voluntary charity but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the zakat through taxes Though monetary donations are the most practiced way of zakat Islam is deeply rooted in the tenets of volunteerism and social activism Areas of ones communities which require assistance and beneficiaries must be a Muslims foci if need be rather than strictly her or his personal or superficial wants For example the ecological wellbeing of the planet ie animal rights global warming natural resources degradation locally nationally globally is a campaign to which every Muslim must adhere Many Muslims practice this today by ensuring that they produce minimal waste give to charity what they no longer need and spend time in prayer and meditation upon the bounties of nature so as to more mindfully approach all that is provided by nature and ultimately Allah Other areas of society in need may be the safety and security of minority populations ie women or persons of color children the elderly the developmentally or physically disabled animals et al Judaism Main article Tikkun olam In To Heal a Fractured World The Ethics of Responsibility Rabbi Jonathan Sacks states that social justice has a central place in Judaism One of Judaism’s most distinctive and challenging ideas is its ethics of responsibility reflected in the concepts of simcha gladness or joy tzedakah the religious obligation to perform charity and philanthropic acts chesed deeds of kindness and tikkun olam repairing the world Christianity Methodism From its founding Methodism was a Christian social justice movement Under John Wesleys direction Methodists became leaders in many social justice issues of the day including the prison reform and abolition movements Wesley himself was among the first to preach for slaves rights attracting significant opposition Today social justice plays a major role in the United Methodist Church The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church says We hold governments responsible for the protection of the rights of the people to free and fair elections and to the freedoms of speech religion assembly communications media and petition for redress of grievances without fear of reprisal to the right to privacy and to the guarantee of the rights to adequate food clothing shelter education and health care The United Methodist Church also teaches population control as part of its doctrine Catholicism Main article Catholic social teaching Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life A distinctive feature of Catholic social doctrine is its concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society Two of the seven key areas of Catholic social teaching are pertinent to social justice Life and dignity of the human person The foundational principle of all Catholic Social Teaching is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person from conception to natural death Human life must be valued above all material possessions Preferential option for the poor and vulnerable Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the Day of Judgement God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy Amen I say to you whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine you did for me The Catholic Church believes that through words prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with and compassion for the poor The moral test of any society is how it treats its most vulnerable members The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church Pope Leo XIII who studied under Taparelli published in 1891 the encyclical Rerum novarum On the Condition of the Working Classes lit On new things rejecting both socialism and capitalism while defending labor unions and private property He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not class conflict and competition In this document Leo set out the Catholic Churchs response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony The encyclical Quadragesimo anno On Reconstruction of the Social Order literally in the fortieth year of 1931 by Pope Pius XI encourages a living wage subsidiarity and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just Pope John Paul II added much to the corpus of the Catholic social teaching penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics politics geopolitical situations ownership of the means of production private property and the social mortgage and private property The encyclicals Laborem exercens Sollicitudo rei socialis and Centesimus annus are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and human rights and spoke forcefully for the poor He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused and admits a fear that the progress of the world is not true progress at all if it should denigrate the value of the human person He argued in Centesimus annus that private property markets and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person Pope Benedict XVIs encyclical Deus caritas est God is Love of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics and not of the church which has charity as its central social concern It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the churchs active role in social justice should be to inform the debate using reason and natural law and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics The official Catholic doctrine on social justice can be found in the book Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church published in 2004 and updated in 2006 by the Pontifical Council Iustitia et Pax The Catechism §1928–1948 contain more detail of the Churchs view of social justice Criticism Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice Moral relativists deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general Noncognitivists moral skeptics moral nihilists and most logical positivists deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice Political realists believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the status quo Many other people accept some of the basic principles of social justice such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this One example is the statement by H G Wells that all people are equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen On the other hand some scholars reject the very idea of social justice as meaningless religious selfcontradictory and ideological believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty Perhaps the most complete rejection of the concept of social justice comes from Friedrich Hayek of the Austrian School of economics There can be no test by which we can discover what is socially unjust because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined would appear just to us Social justice does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense like the term a moral stone Ben ONeill of the University of New South Wales argues that for proponents of social justice the notion of rights is a mere term of entitlement indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good no matter how important or trivial abstract or tangible recent or ancient It is merely an assertion of desire and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire In fact since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods paid for through the efforts of others the term actually refers to an intention to use force to acquire ones desires Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action production and voluntary exchange but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them Janusz KorwinMikke states Either social justice has the same meaning as justice – or not If so – why use the additional word social We lose time we destroy trees to obtain paper necessary to print this word If not if social justice means something different from justice – then something different from justice is by definition injustice Sociologist Carl L Bankston has argued that a secular leftist view of social justice entails viewing the redistribution of goods and resources as based on the rights of disadvantaged categories of people rather than on compassion or national interest Bankston maintains that this secular version of social justice became widely accepted due to the rise of demandside economics and to the moral influence of the civil rights movement Social justice movements Social justice is also a concept that is used to describe the movement towards a socially just world eg the Global Justice Movement In this context social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality and can be defined as the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society A number of movements are working to achieve social justice in society These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society regardless of background or procedural justice have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society Liberation theology Main article Liberation theology Liberation theology is a movement in Christian theology which conveys the teachings of Jesus Christ in terms of a liberation from unjust economic political or social conditions It has been described by proponents as an interpretation of Christian faith through the poors suffering their struggle and hope and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor and by detractors as Christianity perverted by Marxism and Communism Although liberation theology has grown into an international and interdenominational movement it began as a movement within the Catholic Church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s The term was coined by the Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutiérrez who wrote one of the movements most famous books A Theology of Liberation 1971 According to Sarah Kleeb Marx would surely take issue she writes with the appropriation of his works in a religious contextthere is no way to reconcile Marxs views of religion with those of Gutierrez they are simply incompatible Despite this in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path the two have much in common and particularly in the first edition of A Theology of Liberation the use of Marxian theory is quite evident Other noted exponents are Leonardo Boff of Brazil Carlos Mugica of Argentina Jon Sobrino of El Salvador and Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay Health care Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of bioethics Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care especially for low income households and families The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare Ruth Faden of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level gender education or any other stratifying factors Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the biomedical model Human rights education Main article Human rights education The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action affirm that Human rights education should include peace democracy development and social justice as set forth in international and regional human rights instruments in order to achieve common understanding and awareness with a view to strengthening universal commitment to human rights See also Beyond Vietnam A Time to Break Silence an antiVietnam war and
