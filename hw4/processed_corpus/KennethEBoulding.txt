 Kenneth Ewart Boulding January 18 1910 – March 18 1993 was a British economist educator peace activist poet religious mystic devoted Quaker systems scientist and interdisciplinary philosopher He was cofounder of General Systems Theory and founder of numerous ongoing intellectual projects in economics and social science He was married to Elise M Boulding Biography Boulding was born in Liverpool England in 1910 He graduated from Oxford University and was granted United States citizenship in 1948 From 1934 to 1937 he was an academic staff at the University of Edinburgh and from 1937 to 1941 he taught at Colgate University From 1945 to 1949 he was a faculty member of Iowa State College now Iowa State University and during the years 1949 to 1967 he was a faculty member of the University of Michigan In 1967 he joined the faculty of the University of Colorado at Boulder where he remained until his retirement Boulding was president of numerous scholarly societies including the American Economic Association the Society for General Systems Research and the American Association for the Advancement of Science He was not only a prolific writer and a creative integrator of knowledge but an academician of world stature—indeed a magisterial figure in the discipline of social science For Boulding economics and sociology were not social sciences—rather they were all aspects of a single social science devoted to the study of human persons and their relationships organizations Boulding spearheaded an evolutionary instead of equilibrium approach to economics Boulding with his wife Elise was an active member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers He took part in Quaker gatherings served on committees and spoke to and about the Friends The two were members of meetings in Nashville Tennessee Ann Arbor Michigan and Boulder Colorado Interestingly although he stuttered when he ministered in a Friends meeting he spoke clearly Kenneth Boulding was instrumental in organizing the first TeachIn relating to the Vietnam War at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in March 1965 He later spoke on the steps of the Hatcher Graduate Library at the University and was pelted with snowballs by a group of disagreeing students In March 1977 he even conducted a silent vigil at the headquarters of the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia to protest what he considered its distancing itself from Quakers He penned the widely circulated There is a Spirit a series of sonnets he wrote in 1945 based on the last statement of the 17th century Quaker James Nayler Boulding emphasized that human economic and other behavior is embedded in a larger interconnected system To understand the results of our behavior economic or otherwise we must first research and develop a scientific understanding of the ecodynamics of the general system the global society in which we live in all its dimensions spiritual and material Boulding believed that in the absence of a committed effort to the right kind of social science research and understanding the human species might well be doomed to extinction But he died optimistic believing our evolutionary journey had just begun Work In addition to economics Boulding made important contributions to the fields of political science sociology philosophy and social psychology Economic Analysis Bouldings major work in economics was his introductory textbook Economic Analysis which first appeared in 1941 The book sought to be a contribution to the development and systematization of the body of economic analysis itself Psychic capital Psychic capital is a term first used by Boulding 1950 Capital is an accumulation of wealth and with psychic capital the accumulation is one of desirable mental states which admittedly are highly transitory in nature The mental states could be memories of pleasure success achievement recognition and the desire to add to psychic capital is likely to be a powerful motivating force Exchanges involving increases or decreases of psychic capital are likely to occur at any time either through decision or through the turn of events However failure in a task could also lead to a depletion of psychic capital An accumulation of negative memories of failures disasters atrocities or perceived injustices and indignities as either recipient or perpetrator could be called negative psychic capital Negative psychic capital can also be a powerful motivating factor in the pursuit of satisfaction through revenge or a settling of scores In either of its forms as positive or negative psychic capital this package of collective memory is an essential link between collective memory and collective mental state The concept is somewhat more specific than social capital which focuses on social networks rather than mental states Evolutionary economics Boulding was the key exponent of the evolutionary economics movement In his “Economic Development as an Evolutionary System” 1961 1964 Boulding suggests a parallel between economic development and biological evolution They economics and evolution are both examples of a larger process which has been at work in this part of the universe for a very long time This is the process of the development of structures of increasing complexity and improbability The evolutionary process always operates through mutation and selection and has involved some distinction between the genotype which mutates and the phenotype which is selected The process by which the genotype constructs the phenotype may be described as organization Economic development manifests itself largely in the production of commodities that is goods and services It originates however in ideas plans and attitudes in the human mind These are the genotypes in economic development This whole process indeed can be described as a process in the growth of knowledge What the economist calls capital is nothing more than human knowledge imposed on the material world Knowledge and the growth of knowledge therefore is the essential key to economic development Investment financial systems and economic organizations and institutions are in a sense only the machinery by which a knowledge process is created and expressed — Kenneth E Boulding Kenneth Boulding was also nominated for the Nobel Prize for both peace and economics See also Systems science
