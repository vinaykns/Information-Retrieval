 A biocenosis UK English biocoenosis also biocenose biocoenose biotic community biological community ecological community life assemblage coined by Karl MÃ¶bius in 1877 describes the interacting organisms living together in a habitat biotope In the palaeontological literature the term distinguishes life assemblages which reflect the original living community living together at one place and time In other words it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific time Which is different from death assemblages thanatocoenoses Of course no palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community ie the biocoenosis in the sense used by an ecologist the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context Based on the concept of biocenosis ecological communities can take in various forms Zoocenosis for the faunal community Phytocenosis for the flora community Microbiocenosis for the microbial community The geographical extent of a biocenose is limited by the requirement of a more or less uniform species composition Ecosystems Main article Ecosystem An ecosystem originally defined by Tansley 1935 is a biotic community or biocenosis along with its physical environment or biotope In ecological studies biocenosis is the emphasis on relationships between species in an area These relationships are an additional consideration to the interaction of each species with the physical environment Biotic communities Biotic communities vary in size and larger ones may contain smaller ones Species interactions are evident in food or feeding relationships A method of delineating biotic communities is to map the food network to identify which species feed upon which others and then determine the system boundary as the one that can be drawn through the fewest consumption links relative to the number of species within the boundary Mapping biotic communities is important identifying sites needing environmental protection such as the British Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSIs The Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage maintains a register of Threatened Species and Threatened Ecological Communities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 EPBC Act See also Environment portal Ecology portal Earth sciences portal Biology portal Community ecology Hylozoism Population biology References Further reading Kendeigh S Charles 1961 Animal Ecology PrenticeHall Inc Englewood Cliffs NJ 468 p Tansley A G 1935 The use and abuse of vegetational concepts and terms Ecology 163 284307
