 Small hydro is the development of hydroelectric power on a scale suitable for local community and industry or to contribute to distributed generation in a regional electricity grid The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of 1 to 20 megawatts MW is common In contrast many hydroelectric projects are of enormous size such as the generating plant at the Three Gorges Dam at 22500 megawatts or the vast multiple projects of the Tennessee Valley Authority Small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a national electricity grid or in areas where a national grid does not exist Description The use of the term small hydro varies considerably around the world the maximum limit is usually somewhere between 10 and 30 MW While a minimum limit is not usually set the US National Hydropower Association specifies a minimum limit of 5 MW The small hydro description may be stretched up to 50 MW in the United States Canada and China Small hydro can be further subdivided into mini hydro usually defined as 100 to 1000 kilowatts kW and micro hydro which is 5 to 100 kW Micro hydro is usually the application of hydroelectric power sized for smaller communities single families or small enterprise The smallest installations are pico hydro below 5 kW Since small hydro projects usually have correspondingly small civil construction work and little or no reservoir they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro Growth According to a report by REN21 during 2008 small hydro installations grew by 28 over year 2005 to raise the total world small hydro capacity to 85 gigawatts GW Over 70 of this was in China with 65 GW followed by Japan 35 GW the United States 3 GW and India 2 GW China planned to electrify a further 10000 villages between 2005 and 2010 under their China Village Electrification Program including further investments in small hydro and photovoltaics By 2010 China had 45000 small hydro installations especially in rural areas producing 160 Twh annually Over 50 of the worlds potential small hydro power was found in Asia however the report noted It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents In the mountains and rain forests of British Columbia Canada there are a great many sites suitable for hydro development However environmental concerns towards large reservoirs after the 1980s halted new dam construction The solution to coping with increased demand was to offer contracts to independent power producers who have built 100 run of the river projects under 50MW Power production without reservoirs varies dramatically but older conventional dams retain or release water to average out production though the year In 2014 these independent producers generated 18000 GWh from 4500 MW of capacity Generation Main article hydroelectricity Hydroelectric power is the generation of electric power from the movement of water A hydroelectric facility requires a dependable flow of water and a reasonable height for the water to fall called the head In a typical installation water is fed from a reservoir through a pipe into a turbine The water flowing through the turbine causes a electrical generator to rotate converting the motion into electrical energy Small hydro may developed by constructing new facilities or through redevelopment of existing dams whose primary purpose is flood control or irrigation Old hydro sites may be redeveloped sometimes salvaging substantial investment in the installation such as penstock pipe and turbines or just reusing the water rights associated with an abandoned site Either of these cost saving advantages can make the return on investment for a small hydro site well worth the use of existing sites Project design Many companies offer standardized turbine generator packages in the approximate size range of 200 kW to 10 MW These water to wire packages simplify the planning and development of the site since one vendor looks after most of the equipment supply Since nonrecurring engineering costs are minimized and development cost is spread over multiple units the cost of such package systems is reduced While synchronous generators capable of isolated plant operation are often used small hydro plants connected to an electrical grid system can use economical induction generators to further reduce installation cost and simplify control and operation Small run of the river projects do not have a conventional dam with a reservoir only a weir to form a headpond for diversion of inlet water to the turbine unused water simply flows over the weir and the headpond may only be capable of a single days storage not enough for dry summers or frozen winters when generation may come to a halt A preferred scenario is to have the inlet in an existing lake Countries like India and China have policies in favor of small hydro the regulatory process allows for building dams and reservoirs In North America and Europe the regulatory process is too long and expensive to consider having a dam and a reservoir for a small project Small hydro projects usually have faster environmental and licensing procedures and since the equipment is usually in serial production standardized and simplified and since the civil works construction is also reduced small hydro projects may be developed very rapidly The physically smaller size of equipment makes it easier to transport to remote areas without good road or rail access One measure of decreased environmental impact with lakes and reservoirs depends on the balance between stream flow and power production Reducing water diversions helps the rivers ecosystem but reduces the hydro systems return on Investment ROI The hydro system design must strike a balance to maintain both the health of the stream and the economics Sample list of small
