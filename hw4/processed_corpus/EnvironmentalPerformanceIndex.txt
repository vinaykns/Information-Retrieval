 The Environmental Performance Index EPI is a method of quantifying and numerically marking the environmental performance of a states policies This index was developed from the Pilot Environmental Performance Index first published in 2002 and designed to supplement the environmental targets set forth in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals The EPI was preceded by the Environmental Sustainability Index ESI published between 1999 and 2005 Both indexes were developed by Yale University Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission The ESI was developed to evaluate environmental sustainability relative to the paths of other countries Due to a shift in focus by the teams developing the ESI the EPI uses outcomeoriented indicators then working as a benchmark index that can be more easily used by policy makers environmental scientists advocates and the general public Other leading indices like the Global Green Economy Index GGEI provide an integrated measure of the environmental social and economic dynamics of national economies The GGEI utilizes EPI data for the environmental dimension of the index while also providing a performance assessment of efficiency sectors eg transport buildings energy investment green innovation and national leadership around climate change As of January 2012 four EPI reports have been released the Pilot 2006 Environmental Performance Index and the 2008 2010 and 2012 Environmental Performance Index For the 2012 report a new Pilot Trend EPI was developed to rank countries based on the environmental performance changes occurred during the last decade allowing to establish which countries are improving and which are declining In the 2014 EPI ranking the top five countries were Switzerland Luxembourg Australia Singapore and the Czech Republic The bottom five countries in 2014 were Somalia Mali Haiti Lesotho and Afghanistan The United Kingdom was ranked in 12th place Japan 26th place the United States 33rd Brazil 77th China 118th and India came in 155th The top five countries based on their 2012 Pilot Trend EPI were Estonia Kuwait El Salvador Namibia and Congo 2016 variables Source 2010 variables EPI scores 2016 On 23 January 2016 the
