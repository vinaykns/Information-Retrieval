consisting of 58 small lakes and their watersheds set aside for scientific research Located in a Northwestern Ontario Canada the lakes in the region are not affected by human impacts By manipulating these small lakes scientists are able to examine how all aspects of the ecosystem—from the atmosphere to fish populations—respond Findings from these realworld experiments are often much more accurate than those from research conducted at smaller scales such as in laboratories IISD took over operation of the Experimental Lakes Area in 2014 IISD Reporting Services IISD Reporting Services IISDRS

making bringing together many of the negotiating experiences that they have tracked through each issue of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin Knowledge Management In 2008 IISD began tracking activities throughout the United Nations system related to climate change in the lead up to the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference “Climate Change Policy Practice” is a knowledgebase that IISD updates daily with news and events related to intergovernmental climate change policy This knowledgebase offers a searchable data set on meetings publications and upcoming events that the United Nations system has undertaken in response to climate change IISD has subsequently created additional knowledgebases to track international activities related to Biodiversity Forests Land Water and Sanitation Chemicals and Wastes Sustainable Development Sustainable Energy the Post2015 Development Agenda Small Island Developing States Latin America and the Caribbean Africa and AsiaPacific Summaries of recent posts to each of these knowledgebases are distributed through related electronic mailing lists that IISD maintains These listservs also distribute posts from subscribers regarding their recent
