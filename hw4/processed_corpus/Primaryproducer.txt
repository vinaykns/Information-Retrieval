 Primary producers are organisms in an ecosystem that produce biomass from inorganic compounds autotrophs In almost all cases these are photosynthetically active organisms plants cyanobacteria and a number of other unicellular organisms see article on photosynthesis However there are examples of archaea and bacteria unicellular organisms that produce biomass from the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean Fungi and other organisms that gain their biomass from oxidizing organic materials are called decomposers and are not primary producers However lichens located in tundra climates are an exceptional example of a primary producer that by mutualistic symbiosis combine photosynthesis by algae or additionally nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria with the protection of a decomposer fungus See also Primary production External links Lichen Biology and the Environment wwwlichencom  Lichens herbariumusuedu  Lichens archivebioedacuk
