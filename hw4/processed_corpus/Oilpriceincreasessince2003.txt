 From the mid1980s to September 2003 the inflation adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under 25barrel Then during 2004 the price rose above 40 and then 50 A series of events led the price to exceed 60 by August 11 2005 leading to a recordspeed hike that reached 75 by the middle of 2006 Prices then dropped back to 60barrel by the early part of 2007 before rising steeply again to 92barrel by October 2007 and 9929barrel for December futures in New York on November 21 2007 Throughout the first half of 2008 oil regularly reached record high prices Prices on June 27 2008 touched 14171barrel for August delivery in the New York Mercantile Exchange amid Libyas threat to cut output and OPECs president predicted prices may reach 170 by the Northern summer The highest recorded price per barrel maximum of 14702 was reached on July 11 2008 After falling below 100 in the late summer of 2008 prices rose again in late September On September 22 oil rose over 25 to 130 before settling again to 12092 marking a record oneday gain of 1637 Electronic crude oil trading was temporarily halted by NYMEX when the daily price rise limit of 10 was reached but the limit was reset seconds later and trading resumed By October 16 prices had fallen again to below 70 and on November 6 oil closed below 60 Then in 2009 prices went slightly higher although not to the extent of the 20052007 crisis exceeding 100 in 2011 and most of 2012 Since late 2013 the oil price has fallen below the 100 mark plummeting below the 50 mark one year later As the price of producing petroleum did not rise significantly the price increases have coincided with a period of record profits for the oil industry Between 2004 and 2007 the profits of the six supermajors ExxonMobil Total Shell BP Chevron and ConocoPhillips totaled 4948 billion Likewise major oildependent countries such as Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Canada Russia Venezuela and Nigeria have benefited economically from surging oil prices during the 2000s 2003 United States crude oil prices averaged 30 a barrel in 2003 due to political instability within various oil producing nations It rose 19 from the average in 2002 The 2003 invasion of Iraq marked a significant event for oil markets because Iraq contains a large amount of global oil reserves The conflict coincided with an increase in global demand for petroleum but it also reduced Iraqs current oil production and has been blamed for increasing oil prices However oil company CEO Matthew Simmons emphasizes the peaking and decline of oilexporting in Mexico Indonesia and the United Kingdom is the reason for the price gouging According to Simmons isolated events such as the Iraq war affect shortterm prices but do not determine a longterm trend Simmons cites the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques in large fields such as Mexicos Cantarell which maintained production for a few years until it eventually declined Pumping oil out of Iraq may reduce petroleum prices in the short term but will be unable to perpetually lower the price From Simmons point of view the invasion of Iraq is associated with the start of longterm increase in oil prices but it may mitigate the decline in oil production by retaining a partial amount of Iraqs oil reserves As a direct consequence the oil production capacity was diminished to 2 million barrels 320000 m per day 2004 to 2008 rising costs of oil After retreating for several months in late 2004 and early 2005 crude oil prices rose to new highs in March 2005 The price on NYMEX has been above 50 per barrel since March 5 2005 In June 2005 crude oil prices broke the psychological barrier of 60 per barrel From 2005 onwards the price elasticity of the crude oil market changed significantly Before 2005 a small increase in oil price lead to an noticeable expansion of the production volume Later price rises let the production grow only by small numbers This was the reason to call 2005 a tipping point After the destruction of Hurricane Katrina in the United States gasoline prices reached a record high during the first week of September 2005 The average retail price was on average 304 per US gallon The average retail price of a liter of petrol in the United Kingdom was 864p on October 19 2006 or 613 per gallon Oil production in Iraq continued to decline as result of the nations ongoing conflict causing a decrease in production to 1 million barrels per day 160000 md In mid2006 crude oil was traded for over USD 79 per barrel bbl setting an alltime record The runup is attributed to a 19 increase in gasoline consumption geopolitical tensions resulting from North Koreas missile launch The ongoing Iraq war as well as Israel and Lebanon going to war are also causative factors The higher price of oil substantially cut growth of world oil demand in 2006 including a reduction in oil demand of the OECD After news of North Koreas successful nuclear test on October 9 2006 oil prices rose past 60 a barrel but fell back the next day On October 19 2007 US light crude rose to 9002 per barrel due to a combination of ongoing tensions in eastern Turkey and the reducing strength of the US dollar Prices fell briefly on the expectation of increased US crude oil stocks however they quickly rose to a peak of 9222 on October 26 2007 On January 2 2008 US light crude surpassed 100 per barrel before falling to 9969 due to tensions on New Years Day in Nigeria and on suspicion that US crude stocks will have dropped for the seventh consecutive week A BBC report from the following day stated a single trader bid up the price Stephen Schork a former floor trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the editor of an oil market newsletter said one floor trader bought 1000 barrels 160 m the smallest amount permitted and immediately sold it for 9940 at a 600 loss Oil fell back later in the week to 9791 at the close of trading on Friday January 4 in part due to a weak jobs report that showed unemployment had risen On March 5 2008 OPEC accused the United States of economic mismanagement that was pushing oil prices to record highs rebuffing calls to boost output and laying blame at the George W Bush administration Oil prices surged above 110 to a new inflationadjusted record on March 12 2008 before settling at 10992 On April 18 2008 the price of oil broke 117 per barrel after a Nigerian militant group claimed an attack on an oil pipeline Oil prices rose to a new high of 11990 a barrel on April 22 2008 before dipping and then rising 3 on April 25 2008 to 11910 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a news report that a ship contracted by the US Military Sealift Command fired at an Iranian boat On June 6 prices rose 11 in 24 hours the largest gain in history due to the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran The combination of two major oil suppliers reducing supply generated fears of a repeat of the 1973 oil crisis The midJuly decision of Saudi Arabia to increase oil output caused little significant influence on prices According to the oil minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran GholamHossein Nozari the world markets were saturated and a Saudi promise of increased production would not lower prices Several Asian refineries were refusing Saudi petroleum in late June because they were over priced grade On July 3 the Brent North Sea crude contract for August delivery rose to US14501 a barrel in Asian trade London Brent crude reached a record of 14575 a barrel and Brent crude for August delivery peaked to a record 14511 a barrel on Londons ICE Futures Europe exchange and to 14444 a barrel on the NYMExchange By midday in Europe crude rose to 14585 a barrel on the NYME while Brent crude futures rose to a trading record of 14669 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange 2008 oil prices peak at 14585 then bottom at 32 On July 15 2008 a bubblebursting selloff began after remarks by President Bush the previous day that the ban on oil drilling would be lifted This precipitated an 8 drop the biggest since the first USIraq war By the end of the week crude oil fell 11 to 128 also affected by easing of tensions between the US and Iran By August 13 prices had fallen to 113 a barrel By the middle of September oil price fell below 100 for the first time in over six months falling below 92 in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy A stronger US dollar and a likely decline in European demand were suggested to be among the causes of the decline By October 24 the price of crude dropped to 6415 and closed at 6077 on November 6 By the end of December 2008 oil had bottomed out at 32 2009 In January 2009 oil prices rose temporarily because of tensions in the Gaza Strip From mid January to February 13 oil fell to near 35 a barrel 2010 On May 21 2010 the price of oil had dropped in two weeks from 88 to 70 mainly due to concerns over how European countries would reduce budget deficits if the European economy slowed down this would mean less demand for crude oil Also if the European economic crisis caused the American economy to have problems demand for oil would be reduced further Other factors included the strong dollar and high inventories According to the US Energy Information Administration gas prices nationwide averaged 291 on May 10 dropping to 279 two weeks later The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was not a factor in gas prices since the well had not produced Prices rose back to 90barrel in December 2010 The US average for a gallon of 87 octane regular unleaded averaged 300gallon on December 23 sparking fear of a second recession if prices reached 100barrel and 400gallon gasoline as forecasted for spring 2011 The price increases in December were based on global demand and the Arctic blasts affecting North America and Europe 2011 Political turmoil in Egypt Libya Yemen and Bahrain drove oil prices to 95barrel in late February 2011 A few days prior oil prices on the NYMEX closed at 86 Oil prices topped at 103 on February 24 where oil production is curtailed to the political upheaval in Libya Oil supplies remained high and Saudi Arabia assured an increase in production to counteract shutdowns Still the Mideast and North African crisis led to a rise in oil prices to the highest level in two years with gasoline prices following Though most Libyan oil went to Europe all oil prices reacted The average price of gasoline in the United States increased 6 cents to 317 On March 1 2011 a significant drop in Libyan production and fears of more instability in other countries pushed the price of oil over 100 a barrel in New York trading while the average price of gas reached 337 Despite Saudi promises the sour type oil the country exported could not replace the more desirable sweet Libyan oil On March 7 2011 the average price of gas having reached 357 individuals were making changes in their driving The weakened US Dollar resulted in a spike to 112barrel with the national average of 374gallon with expectations of damaging the US economy suggestive of a longterm recession As of April 26 the national average was 387 with a fear of 4gallon as the nationwide average prior to the summer driving season The national average rose on May 5 2011 for the 44th straight day reaching 398 However that same day West Texas Intermediate crude fell below 100 a barrel the lowest since March 16 This came after crude oil for June delivery reached 11483 on May 2 the highest since September 2008 before closing at 9718 on May 6 a day after dropping 9 percent the most dramatic singleday drop in over two years Gas prices fell slightly on May 6 and experts predicted 350 a gallon by summer In midJune West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery fell nearly 2 to 9301 the lowest price since February The dollar was up and the euro and other currencies down and the European economic crisis made investors concerned London Brent crude fell 81 cents to 11321 On June 15 the Energy Information Association said oil consumption was down 35 percent from a year earlier but wholesale gasoline demand was up for the first time in several weeks The price of gas on June 17 was 3675 a gallon 251 cents lower than a month earlier but 968 cents above a year earlier On June 24 the price of gas was 3628 and expected to go much lower due to the opening of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve US oil prices fell below 90 before rising again and Brent crude fell two percent However on June 29 West Texas intermediate crude had risen to 9496 almost 5 above the lowest point reached after the previous weeks action One reason was the falling dollar as Greece appeared less likely to default on its debt concern over the Greek debt crisis had caused falling oil prices After another week oil for August delivery had risen from 9061 to 9867 and gas prices were up five cents Increased worldwide demand was one reason Brent Crude remained high at 11838 partly due to supply problems in Europe including lower North Sea production and the continuing war in Libya On August 4 the price of oil dropped 6 percent to its lowest level in 6 months On August 5 the price had dropped 882 in a week to 8688 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange The same pessimistic economic news that caused stock prices to fall also decreased expected energy demand and experts predicted a

9 percent for the week due to concerns about another recession and the overall world economy The average price of gas was 351 with predictions of 325 by November but it was below 3 in some markets During October the price of oil rose 22 percent the fastest pace since February as worries over the US economy decreased leading to predictions of 4 by early 2012 As of November 8 the price reached 9680 Gas prices were not following the increase due to lower demand resulting from the economy the normal decrease in travel lower oil prices in other countries and production of winter blends which cost less The average rose slightly to 341 but predictions of 325 were made 2012 Shortages of oil could have resulted if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz through which onefifth of exported oil travels as a result of sanctions due to the countrys nuclear policies The price of oil stayed near 100 throughout January because of concerns over supplies and the European debt situation The average price of gas was 338 on January 20 up 17 cents from a month earlier Another factor was planned closing of refineries in the US and Europe due to lower demand By early February the national average was 348 though oil prices were at 98 the lowest in six weeks and US demand was the lowest since September 2001 On February 20 benchmark March crude oil reached 10521 the highest in nine months This came one day after Irans oil ministry announced an end to sales to British and French companies though this would have little actual impact on supplies fears resulted in higher prices Also approval of the bailout plan for Greece was expected and Chinas action to raise the money supply was likely to stimulate the economy Brent crude was up 11 percent for the year to 11958 on February 17 with cold weather in Europe and higher Third World demand and West Texas Intermediate crude was up 19 percent to 10324 The average price of gas was 353 On February 29 the average was 373 The average peaked at

July 17 Benchmark Crude reached 8922 and Brent crude 104 after good economic news in the United States Gas rose to 340 On August 7 a California refinery fire contributed to a jump in oil futures Other refinery problems a pipeline leak fears about Iran the crisis in Syria North Sea problems and Tropical Storm Ernesto all contributed to a 20 percent jump in oil prices in six weeks The price of gas reached 363 but was not expected to go much higher Good economic news in the United States contributed to oil reaching its highest price since May on August 17 with Benchmark Crude reaching 9601 while

Benchmark Crude reached 9541 with Brent crude at 11484 The price of gas went down slightly to 382 but was still the highest ever for Labor Day weekend Hurricane Isaac contributed to a temporary spike in gas prices but on September 12 gas once again rose to 386 as refineries cut production prior to the switch from summer blend gasoline to winter blend Benchmark Crude also reached its highest level

January delivery to 8792 benchmark oil reached 8624 on November 28 and gas was 341 On December 13 Brent crude was down to 10920 while benchmark oil fell slightly due to US fiscal cliff concerns and

Business the efficiency of newer shale oil wells that use hydraulic fracturing in the United States combined with the US12 million upfront well drilling and construction costs provide incentives to oil producers to continue to flood the already glutted market with underpriced oil in spite of crude oil storage limitations Many less efficient and less productive older wells were shut down but these shale oil wells continue to increase production while making a profit in a market where crude oil is priced as low as US50 a barrel In 16 April the price of WTI hit a high of 5652 for 2015

Exporting Countries OPEC member Venezuelas Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino and a Goldman Sachs analyst Michele Della Vigna suggested that oil may go as low as 20perbarrel mark although with a 15
