 Various rights associated with a fair trial are explicitly proclaimed in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights as well as numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the world There is no binding international law that defines what is not a fair trial for example the right to a jury trial and other important procedures vary from nation to nation Definition in international human rights law The right to fair trial is very helpful in numerous declarations which represent customary international law such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR Though the UDHR enshrines some fair trial rights such as the presumption of innocence until the accused is proven guilty in Articles 6 7 8 and 11 the key provision is Article 10 which states that Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him Some years after the UDHR was adopted the right to a fair trial was defined in more detail in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR The right to a fair trial is protected in Articles 14 and 16 of the ICCPR which is binding in international law on those states that are party to it Article 141 establishes the basic right to a fair trial article 142 provides for the presumption of innocence and article 143 sets out a list of minimum fair trial rights in criminal proceedings Article 145 establishes the right of a convicted person to have a higher court review the conviction or sentence and article 147 prohibits double jeopardy Article 141 states that All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals In the determination of any criminal charge against him or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent independent and impartial tribunal established by law The press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals public order or national security in a democratic society or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children Geneva Conventions – International right to a fair trial when no crime is alleged The Geneva Conventions guarantee combatants the right not to be put on trial for fighting in a war – unless they commit a war crime a grave breach or other crime eg captured behind enemy lines out of proper uniforms or insignia while carrying out espionage or sabotage operations Most held under the Geneva Conventions are not accused of a crime and therefore it would be a war crime under the Geneva Conventions to give them a trial This protection against getting a trial is fully consistent with human rights law because human rights law prohibits putting people on trial when there is no crime to try them for The Geneva Conventions however guarantee that anyone charged with a war crime or other crime must get a fair trial Definition in regional human rights law The right to a fair trial is enshrined in articles 3 7 and 26 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights ACHPR The right to a fair trial is also enshrined in articles 5 6 and 7 of the European Charter on Human Rights and articles 2 to 4 of the 7th Protocol to the Charter The right to a fair trial is furthermore enshrined in articles 3 8 9 and 10 of the American Convention on Human Rights Relationship with other rights The right to equality before the law is sometimes regarded as part of the right to a fair trial It is typically guaranteed under a separate article in international human rights instruments The right entitles individuals to be recognised as subject not as object of the law International human rights law permits no derogation or exceptions to this human right Closely related to the right to a fair trial is the prohibition on ex post facto law or retroactive law which is enshrined in human rights instrument separately from the right to fair trial and can not be limited by states according to the European Convention on Human Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights Fair trial rights The right to a fair trial has been defined in numerous regional and international human rights instruments It is one of the most extensive human rights and all international human rights instruments enshrine it in more than one article The right to a fair trial is one of the most litigated human rights and substantial case law that has been established on the interpretation of this human right Despite variations in wording and placement of the various fair trial rights international human rights instrument define the right to a fair trial in broadly the same terms The aim of the right is to ensure the proper administration of justice As a minimum the right to fair trial includes the following fair trial rights in civil and criminal proceedings the right to be heard by a competent independent and impartial tribunal the right to a public hearing the right to be heard within a reasonable time the right to counsel the right to interpretation States may limit the right to a fair trial or derogate from the fair trial rights only under circumstances specified in the human rights instruments In the United States In the United States the right to a fair trial is sometimes illusory For example the United States Supreme Court said in Town of Newton v Rumery 480 US 386 that a prosecutor may threaten a person that he will take or withhold an official act and prosecute that person for crime unless that person disposes or parts with their right to peacefully and orderly petition the courts for a redress of grievances For example the Rumery court said when talking about an accused ″the public interest opposing involuntary waiver of constitutional rights is no reason to hold the agreement here invalid″ Rumery did not receive nor waive their right to a trial during a criminal cause In civil proceedings The European Court of Human Rights and the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights have clarified that the right to a fair trial applies to all types of judicial proceedings whether civil or criminal According to the European Court of Human Rights Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the fair trial rights apply to all civil rights and obligations created under domestic law and therefore to all civil proceedings see Apeh Uldozotteinek Szovetsege and Others v Hungary 2000 In administrative proceedings Both the European Court of Human Rights and the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights have clarified that the right to a fair trial applies not only to judicial proceedings but also administrative proceedings If an individuals right under the law is at stake the dispute must be determined through a fair process In special proceedings In Europe special proceeding may also be subject to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights In Mills v the United Kingdom 2001 the European Court of Human Rights held that a courtmartial was subject to Article 6 because of the defendants had been accused of what the court considered to be serious crime assault with a weapon and wounding The African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights ACHPR frequently deals with instances where civilians are tried by military tribunals for serious crimes The ACHPR has held that on the face of it military courts to do not satisfy civilians right to a fair trial see Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria In this respect the ACHPR has reaffirmed the right to counsel as essential in guaranteeing a fair trial The ACHPR held that individuals have the right to choose their own counsel and that giving the military tribunal the right to veto a counsel violates the right to a fair trial Impeding a fair trial A fair trial might be impeded by Contempt of court typically by the media or jurors Witness intimidation Nondisclosure of evidence through malice or through use of state secrets privilege in the USA or publicinterest immunity in the UK In Spain In the Spanish legal justice system the examining magistrate is the head of the investigation of a specific crime and any other matters that may relate to that particular offence The magistrate can be aided by the judicial and national police and can also at the request of the prosecution and defence attorney follow any number of leads regarding the case The magistrate can also when deemed appropriate restrict the access the defence and prosecution have to the primary evidence and case information which can include allowing witness statements to be introduced without the actual witness having to be in attendance An extension of this power is the ability for the judge to declare under special circumstances the trial wholly or partially confidential However this is only when information and evidence presented during the trial could pose a threat to an individual a group of individuals or even the general interest of the public In the United Kingdom Between 1971 and 1975 the right to a fair trial was suspended in Northern Ireland Suspects were simply imprisoned without trial and tortured by the British army for information This power was mostly used against the Catholic minority The British government supplied deliberately misleading evidence to the European Court of Human Rights when it investigated this issue in 1978 The Irish government and human rights group Amnesty International requested that the ECHR reconsider the case in December 2014 Three court cases related to the Northern Ireland conflict took place in mainland Britain in 1975 and 1976 have been accused of being unfair resulting in the false imprisonment of the Birmingham Six Guildford Four and Maguire Seven These convictions were later overturned though an investigation into allegations that police officers perverted the course of justice failed to convict anyone of wrongdoing The United Kingdom created an act – the Special Immigration Appeals Act in 1997 which then led to the creation of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission SIAC It allowed for secret evidence to be stated in court however it provides provisions for the anonymity of the sources and information itself The judge has the power to clear the courtroom of the public and press and the appellant if need be if sensitive information must be relayed The appellant is provided with a Special Advocate who is appointed in order to represent their interests however no contact can be made with the appellant after seeing the secret evidence SIAC is mostly used for deportation cases and other cases of public interest Secret evidence has seen increased use in UK courts Some argue that this undermines the British criminal justice system as this evidence may not come under proper democratic scrutiny Secret evidence can now be used in wide range of cases including deportations hearings control orders proceedings parole board cases assetfreezing applications precharge detention hearings in terrorism cases employment tribunals and planning tribunals Juries and a fair trial The rationale for a jury was that it offers a check against state power Under Article 6 of the ECHR the right to a fair trial implies that accused and public must be able to understand the verdict Trials decided by jury as they do not provide reasons for their decision therefore do not allow for this In Taxquet v Belgium a violation of article 61 was found The court also implied a right to a reasoned verdict irrespective of whether that was given by a judge or a jury Under ECHR case law jury decisions can also be problematic in circumstances where juries draw adverse inferences from trial judges directions in contravention of Article 63 b and c EU member states that do not have a jury system or any other form of lay adjudication in criminal matters or have abolished it include Cyprus Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg the Netherlands and Romania In these countries criminal courts are composed exclusively of judges EU member states with a collaborative jury system which comprises a combination of jurors and judge include Bulgaria Croatia the Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Italy Norway in most cases Poland Portugal Serbia Slovakia Slovenia and Sweden The collaborative system which can also be employed alongside the traditional jury model is characterised by the professional judges and the jurors collectively determining all questions of law and fact the issue of guilt and the sentence Within the EU the traditional jury system exists within Austria Belgium Ireland Malta Norway only in serious appeal cases Spain and the United Kingdom England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland With the expansion of the EU It is seen as problematic that juries are used given that their use cannot ensure all the guarantees set out under Article 6 particularly in the everexpanding landscape and corpus of European law Children and the trial process The issue of children and juvenile engagement with court proceedings and the criminal justice system is a contemporary issue when dealing with the human right of a fair trial Juveniles need to be competent to stand trial and be able to comprehend the proceedings for their criminal trial to be considered a fair trial This stands as a contentious issue because many argue that it may never be fair for children to have a role in trial or be involved in criminal justice proceedings due to their age inability to grasp legal concepts etc In discussing children in the legal system the Netherlands and Sweden provide for an intriguing contrast which assists in understanding of the different punitive measures applicable In Sweden children under the age of 15 are not held accountable for the crimes which they may have committed Young people aged between 15 and 18 are generally sentenced to a fine or placed in a social services care agreement by order of the court This care can often be in combination with fines or additional community service It is a rare occurrence for young people to be sentenced to imprisonment For the most serious crimes such as murder and manslaughter the penalty may be institutionalisation at a specialised youth home The National Board of Institutional Care is responsible to enforce these sentences This punishment is for a fixed term and its focus is on care treatment and the rehabilitation of young offenders By contrast the age of criminal responsibility in the Netherlands is 12 A specialised youth police and courts system was reintroduced in the Netherlands in order to provide for a specialised task force to deal with youth crime At the age of 16 an offender who commits crime may be tried in an adult court The ‘stop and halt’ program is also aimed at punishing young offenders Younger children under the age of 12 can be ‘stopped’ when they offend with the main aim at confronting the onset of delinquency Older children over the age of 12 can be ‘halted’ with successful completion meaning no criminal record and no prosecution for the young offender in the hope of rehabilitation The main difference between the Netherlands and Sweden in terms of children in court revolves around how the Netherlands tailors its law around its juvenile offence framework meaning that each case is directly measured against that offender’s individual circumstances In Sweden the court system for children is not tailored towards their individual needs rather the framework of the juvenile court system is based on the adult court system However in Sweden unlike in the Netherlands the mitigating circumstance of youth applies in order to provide for a young offender’s needs See also Change of venue Legal aid Natural justice Presumption of innocence References
