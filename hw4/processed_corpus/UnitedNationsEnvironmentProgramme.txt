Glaciers shrinking Further information Retreat of glaciers since 1850 Glaciers are shrinking at record rates and many could disappear within decades the UN Environment Programme said on March 16 2008 The scientists measuring the health of almost 30 glaciers around the world found that ice loss reached record levels in 2006 On average the glaciers shrank by 49 feet in 2006 the most recent year for which data are available The most severe loss was recorded at Norways Breidalblikkbrea glacier which shrank 102 feet in 2006 Glaciers lost an average of about a foot of ice a year between 1980 and 1999 But since the turn of the millennium the average loss has increased to about 20 inches Electric vehicles At the fifth Magdeburg Environmental Forum held from 3–4 July 2008 in Magdeburg Germany UNEP and car manufacturer Daimler called for the establishment of infrastructure for electric vehicles At this international conference 250 highranking representatives from ce politics and nongovernment organizations discussed solutions for future road transportation under the motto of Sustainable Mobility–the Post2012 CO2 Agenda Reports UNEP publishes many reports atlases and

sustain it exceeds what is available In June 2010 a report from UNEP declared that a global shift towards a vegan diet was needed to save the world from hunger fuel shortages and climate change
