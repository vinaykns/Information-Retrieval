 The net capacity factor is the unitless ratio of an actual electrical energy output over a given period of time to the maximum possible electrical energy output over the same amount of time The capacity factor is defined for any electricity producing installation ie a fuel consuming power plant or one using renewable energy such as wind or the sun The capacity factor is thus defined also for any class of such installations and can be used to compare different types of electricity production The maximum possible energy output of a given installation assumes its continuous operation at full nameplate capacity over the relevant period of time The actual energy output over the same period of time and with it the capacity factor varies greatly depending on a range of factors As such the capacity factor can never exceed the availability factor ie the fraction of downtime due to for example reliability issues and maintenance both scheduled and unscheduled Other factors include the design of the installation its location the overall type of electricity production and with it either the fuel being used or for renewable energy the local weather conditions Additionally the capacity factor can be subject to regulatory constraints and market forces potentially affecting both its fuel purchase and its electricity sale To gain insight into seasonal fluctuations the capacity factor can be computed on a monthly basis see the illustration Otherwise it is often computed over a timescale of a year averaging out most temporal fluctuations Alternatively it be computed over the lifetime of the power source both while operational and after decommissioning The capacity factor has some relation to but is different from the capacity credit firm capacity efficiency or cost of energy Sample calculations Nuclear power plant Nuclear power plants are at the high end of the range of capacity factors ideally reduced only by the availability factor ie maintenance and refueling The largest nuclear plant in the US Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station has between its three reactors a nameplate capacity of 3942 MW As of 2010 its annual generation was 31200000 MWh leading to a capacity factor of Each of Palo Verde’s three reactors is refueled every 18 months with one refueling every spring and fall In 2014 a refueling was completed in a record 28 days compared to the 35 days of downtime that the 2010 capacity factor corresponds to Wind farm The Danish offshore wind farm Horns Rev 2 the worlds largest at its inauguration in 2009 has a nameplate capacity of 2093 MW As of January 2017 it has since its commissioning 73 years ago produced 6416 GWh ie an average annual production of 875 GWhyear and a capacity factor of Sites with lower capacity factors may be deemed feasible for wind farms for example the onshore 1 GW Fosen Vind which as of 2017 is under construction in Norway has a projected capacity factor of 39 Certain onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60 for example the 44 MW Eolo plant in Nicaragua had a net generation of 232132 MWh in 2015 equivalent to a capacity factor of 602 Since the capacity factor of a wind turbine measures actual production relative to possible production it is not constrained by Betzs coefficient of 1627 ≈ displaystyle approx 593 which limits production vs energy available in the wind Hydroelectric dam As of 2017 the Three Gorges Dam in China is with its nameplate capacity of 22500 MW the largest power generating station in the world by installed capacity In 2015 it generated 87 TWh for a capacity factor of Hoover Dam has a nameplate capacity of 2080 MW and an annual generation averaging 42 TW·h The annual generation has varied between a high of 10348 TW·h in 1984 and a low of 2648 TW·h in 1956 Taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of Photovoltaic power station At the low range of capacity factors is the photovoltaic power station which supplies power to the electricity grid from a largescale photovoltaic system PV system An inherent limit to its capacity factor comes from its requirement of daylight preferably with a sun unobstructed by clouds smoke or smog shade from trees and building structures Since the amount of sunlight varies both with the time of the day and the seasons of the year the capacity factor is typically computed on an annual basis The amount of available sunlight is mostly determined by the latitude of the installation but also influenced by local factors such as indirect light reflected from a nearby body of water The actual production is also influenced by local factors such as dust and ambient temperature which ideally should be low As for any power station the maximum possible power production is the nameplate capacity times the number of hours in a year while the actual production is the amount of electricity delivered annually to the grid For example Agua Caliente Solar Project located in Arizona near the 33rd parallel and awarded for its excellence in renewable energy has a nameplate capacity of 290 MW and an actual average annual production of 740 GWhyear Its capacity factor is thus A significantly lower capacity factor is achieved by Lauingen Energy Park located in Bavaria near the 49th parallel with a nameplate capacity of 257 MW and an actual average annual production of 2698 GWhyear for a capacity factor of 120 Reasons for reduced capacity factor There are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100 The first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance This accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants Base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output Geothermal plants nuclear plants coalfired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants The second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100 is that output is curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical This accounts for most of the unused capacity of peaking power plants Peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day Their electricity is relatively expensive Many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or times of the year because of variation in loads and electricity prices If a plant is only needed during the day for example even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day all year long it would only have a 50 Capacity factor eg A third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time This can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources When the sun isnt shining solar PV cannot produce electricity When the wind is not blowing wind turbines cannot produce electricity Solar PV and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their fuel sunshine and wind respectively A hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100 due to scarcity of water However its output may also simply be regulated to match the current power need conserving its stored water for later usage A hydroelectricity plant may also be designed for reverse usage so it can pump water up in its reservoir in situations with a power surplus In both cases the use of the hydroelectricity plant to stabilize the grid reduces its capacity factor Hydroelectricity may have a higher capacity factor with respect to the turbine size since in some case the amount of stored water fluctuates to account for intermittent availability of water Other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100 include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output Load following power plants Load following power plants also called intermediate power plants are between base load and peaking plants in terms of capacity factor efficiency and cost per unit of electricity They produce most of their electricity during the day when prices and demand are highest However the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight Capacity factor and renewable energy When it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power wind power and hydroelectricity there is a fourth reason for unused capacity The plant may be capable of producing electricity but its fuel wind sunlight or water may not be available A hydroelectric plants production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream However solar wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors so when they have fuel available they are almost always able to produce electricity When hydroelectric plants have water available they are also useful for load following because of their high dispatchability A typical hydroelectric plants operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes Wind farms are variable due to the natural variability of the wind For a wind farm the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind Transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor Typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45 though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55 capacity factor and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65 capacity factor Solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth seasonal changes and because of cloud cover According to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District observed a 15 capacity factor in 2005 However according to the SolarPACES programme of the International Energy Agency IEA solar power plants designed for solaronly generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands such as Spain or the southwestern United States although in some locations solar PV does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced SolarPACES states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power CSP stations can be extended to become dispatchable load following The IEA CSP Technology Roadmap 2010 suggests that in the sunniest countries CSP can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020 and of baseload power by 2025 to 2030 A dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power Geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week While the carrier medium for geothermal electricity water must be properly managed the source of geothermal energy the Earths heat will be available for the foreseeable future Geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth Real world capacity factors United States According to the US Energy Information Administration EIA in 2009 the capacity factors were as follows Nuclear–903 Coal–638 Natural Gas Plant–425 Hydroelectric–398 Renewables WindSolarBiomass–339 Oil–78 However these values often vary significantly by month Nuclear power 887 2006 2012 average of USs plants Hydroelectricity worldwide average 44 range of 10 99 depending on
