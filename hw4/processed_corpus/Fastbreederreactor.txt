 A breeder reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates more fissile material than it consumes These devices achieve this because their neutron economy is high enough to breed more fissile fuel than they use from fertile material such as uranium238 or thorium232 Breeders were at first found attractive because their fuel economy was better than light water reactors but interest declined after the 1960s as more uranium reserves were found and new methods of uranium enrichment reduced fuel costs Fuel efficiency and types of nuclear waste Breeder reactors could in principle extract almost all of the energy contained in uranium or thorium decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely used oncethrough light water reactors which extract less than 1 of the energy in the uranium mined from the earth The high fuel efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply or energy used in mining Adherents claim that with seawater uranium extraction there would be enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy our energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983s total energy consumption rate thus making nuclear energy effectively a renewable energy Nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s In broad terms spent nuclear fuel has two main components The first consists of fission products the leftover fragments of fuel atoms after they have been split to release energy Fission products come in dozens of elements and hundreds of isotopes all of them lighter than uranium The second main component of spent fuel is transuranics atoms heavier than uranium which are generated from uranium or heavier atoms in the fuel when they absorb neutrons but do not undergo fission All transuranic isotopes fall within the actinide series on the periodic table and so they are frequently referred to as the actinides The physical behavior of the fission products is markedly different from that of the transuranics In particular fission products do not themselves undergo fission and therefore cannot be used for nuclear weapons Furthermore only seven longlived fission product isotopes have halflives longer than a hundred years which makes their geological storage or disposal less problematic than for transuranic materials With increased concerns about nuclear waste breeding fuel cycles became interesting again because they can reduce actinide wastes particularly plutonium and minor actinides Breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel and thus convert them to more fission products After spent nuclear fuel is removed from a light water reactor it undergoes a complex decay profile as each nuclide decays at a different rate Due to a physical oddity referenced below there is a large gap in the decay halflives of fission products compared to transuranic isotopes If the transuranics are left in the spent fuel after 1000 to 100000 years the slow decay of these transuranics would generate most of the radioactivity in that spent fuel Thus removing the transuranics from the waste eliminates much of the longterm radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel Todays commercial light water reactors do breed some new fissile material mostly in the form of plutonium Because commercial reactors were never designed as breeders they do not convert enough uranium238 into plutonium to replace the uranium235 consumed Nonetheless at least onethird of the power produced by commercial nuclear reactors comes from fission of plutonium generated within the fuel Even with this level of plutonium consumption light water reactors consume only part of the plutonium and minor actinides they produce and nonfissile isotopes of plutonium build up along with significant quantities of other minor actinides Conversion ratio breakeven breeding ratio doubling time and burnup One measure of a reactors performance is the conversion ratio the average number of new fissile atoms created per fission event All proposed nuclear reactors except specially designed and operated actinide burners experience some degree of conversion As long as there is any amount of a fertile material within the neutron flux of the reactor some new fissile material is always created The ratio of new fissile material in spent fuel to fissile material consumed from the fresh fuel is known as the conversion ratio or breeding ratio of a reactor For example commonly used light water reactors have a conversion ratio of approximately 06 Pressurized heavy water reactors PHWR running on natural uranium have a conversion ratio of 08 In a breeder reactor the conversion ratio is higher than 1 Breakeven is achieved when the conversion ratio becomes 1 the reactor produces as much fissile material as it uses Doubling time is the amount of time it would take for a breeder reactor to produce enough new fissile material to create a starting fuel load for another nuclear reactor This was considered an important measure of breeder performance in early years when uranium was thought to be scarce However since uranium is more abundant than thought and given the amount of plutonium available in spent reactor fuel doubling time has become a less important metric in modern breeder reactor design Burnup is a measure of how much energy has been extracted from a given mass of heavy metal in fuel often expressed for power reactors in terms of gigawattdays per ton of heavy metal Burnup is an important factor in determining the types and abundances of isotopes produced by a fission reactor Breeder reactors by design have extremely high burnup compared to a conventional reactor as breeder reactors produce much more of their waste in the form of fission products while most or all of the actinides are meant to be fissioned and destroyed In the past breeder reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding ratios from 101 for the Shippingport Reactor running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 12 for the Soviet BN350 liquidmetalcooled reactor Theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements tubeinshell construction suggest breeding ratios of at least 18 are possible on an industrial scale The Soviet BR1 test reactor achieved a breeding ratio of 25 under noncommercial conditions Types of breeder reactor Many types of breeder reactor are possible A breeder is simply a reactor designed for very high neutron economy with an associated conversion rate higher than 10 In principle almost any reactor design could possibly be tweaked to become a breeder An example of this process is the evolution of the Light Water Reactor a very heavily moderated thermal design into the Super Fast Reactor concept using light water in an extremely lowdensity supercritical form to increase the neutron economy high enough to allow breeding Aside from water cooled there are many other types of breeder reactor currently envisioned as possible These include moltensalt cooled gas cooled and liquid metal cooled designs in many variations Almost any of these basic design types may be fueled by uranium plutonium many minor actinides or thorium and they may be designed for many different goals such as creating more fissile fuel longterm steadystate operation or active burning of nuclear wastes For convenience it is perhaps simplest to divide the extant reactor designs into two broad categories based upon their neutron spectrum which has the natural effect of dividing the reactor designs into those designed to use primarily uranium and transuranics and those designed to use thorium and avoid transuranics Fast breeder reactor or FBR uses fast unmoderated neutrons to breed fissile plutonium and possibly higher transuranics from fertile uranium238 The fast spectrum is flexible enough that it can also breed fissile uranium233 from thorium if desired Thermal breeder reactor use thermal spectrum moderated neutrons to breed fissile uranium233 from thorium thorium fuel cycle Due to the behavior of the various nuclear fuels a thermal breeder is thought commercially feasible only with thorium fuel which avoids the buildup of the heavier transuranics Reprocessing Fission of the nuclear fuel in any reactor produces neutronabsorbing fission products Because of this unavoidable physical process it is necessary to reprocess the fertile material from a breeder reactor to remove those neutron poisons This step is required if one is to fully utilize the ability to breed as much or more fuel than is consumed All reprocessing can present a proliferation concern since it extracts weapons usable material from spent fuel The most common reprocessing technique PUREX presents a particular concern since it was expressly designed to separate pure plutonium Early proposals for the breeder reactor fuel cycle posed an even greater proliferation concern because they would use PUREX to separate plutonium in a highly attractive isotopic form for use in nuclear weapons Several countries are developing reprocessing methods that do not separate the plutonium from the other actinides For instance the nonwater based pyrometallurgical electrowinning process when used to reprocess fuel from an integral fast reactor leaves large amounts of radioactive actinides in the reactor fuel More conventional advanced waterbased reprocessing systems like PUREX include SANEX UNEX DIAMEX COEX and TRUEX—as well as proposals to combine PUREX with coprocesses All these systems have modestly better proliferation resistance than PUREX though their adoption rate is low In the thorium cycle thorium232 breeds by converting first to protactinium233 which then decays to uranium233 If the protactinium remains in the reactor small amounts of U232 are also produced which has the strong gamma emitter Tl208 in its decay chain Similar to uraniumfueled designs the longer the fuel and fertile material remain in the reactor the more of these undesirable elements build up Inside the envisioned commercial thorium reactors high levels of U232 would be allowed to accumulate leading to extremely high gamma radiation doses from any uranium derived from thorium These gamma rays complicate the safe handling of a weapon and the design of its electronics this explains why U233 has never been pursued for weapons beyond proofofconcept demonstrations Waste reduction Nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s Breeding fuel cycles attracted renewed interest because of their potential to reduce actinide wastes particularly plutonium and minor actinides Since breeder reactors on a closed fuel cycle would use nearly all of the actinides fed into them as fuel their fuel requirements would be reduced by a factor of about 100 The volume of waste they generate would be reduced by a factor of about 100 as well While there is a huge reduction in the volume of waste from a breeder reactor the activity of the waste is about the same as that produced by a light water reactor In addition the waste from a breeder reactor has a different decay behavior because it is made up of different materials Breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products while light water reactor waste has a large quantity of transuranics After spent nuclear fuel has been removed from a light water reactor for longer than 100000 years these transuranics would be the main source of radioactivity Eliminating them would eliminate much of the longterm radioactivity from the spent fuel In principle breeder fuel cycles can recycle and consume all actinides leaving only fission products As the graphic in this section indicates fission products have a peculiar gap in their aggregate halflives such that no fission products have a halflife longer than 91 years and shorter than two hundred thousand years As a result of this physical oddity after several hundred years in storage the activity of the radioactive waste from a Fast Breeder Reactor would quickly drop to the low level of the longlived fission products However to obtain this benefit requires the highly efficient separation of transuranics from spent fuel If the fuel reprocessing methods used leave a large fraction of the transuranics in the final waste stream this advantage would be greatly reduced Both types of breeding cycles can reduce actinide wastes The fast breeder reactors fast neutrons can fission actinide nuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons Such nuclei usually lack the lowspeed thermal neutron resonances of fissile fuels used in LWRs The thorium fuel cycle inherently produces lower levels of heavy actinides The fertile material in the thorium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 232 while the fertile material in the uranium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 238 That mass difference means that thorium232 requires six more neutron capture events per nucleus before the transuranic elements can be produced In addition to this simple mass difference the reactor gets two chances to fission the nuclei as the mass increases First as the effective fuel nuclei U233 and as it absorbs two more neutrons again as the fuel nuclei U235 A reactor whose main purpose is to destroy actinides rather than increasing fissile fuel stocks is sometimes known as a burner reactor Both breeding and burning depend on good neutron economy and many designs can do either Breeding designs surround the core by a breeding blanket of fertile material Waste burners surround the core with nonfertile wastes to be destroyed Some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers Breeder reactor concepts There are several concepts for breeder reactors the two main ones are Reactors with a fast neutron spectrum are called fast breeder reactors FBR – these typically utilize uranium238 as fuel Reactors with a thermal neutron spectrum are called thermal breeder reactors – these typically utilize thorium232 as fuel Fast breeder reactor In 2006 all largescale fast breeder reactor FBR power stations were liquid metal fast breeder reactors LMFBR cooled by liquid sodium These have been of one of two designs Loop type in which the primary coolant is circulated through primary heat exchangers outside the reactor tank but inside the biological shield due to radioactive sodium24 in the primary coolant Pool type in which the primary heat exchangers and pumps are immersed in the reactor tank All current fast neutron reactor designs use liquid metal as the primary coolant to transfer heat from the core to steam used to power the electricity generating turbines FBRs have been built cooled by liquid metals other than sodium—some early FBRs used mercury other experimental reactors have used a sodiumpotassium alloy called NaK Both have the advantage that they are liquids at room temperature which is convenient for experimental rigs but less important for pilot or full scale power stations Lead and leadbismuth alloy have also been used The relative merits of lead vs sodium are discussed here Looking further ahead four of the proposed generation IV reactor types are FBRs GasCooled Fast Reactor GFR cooled by helium SodiumCooled Fast Reactor SFR based on the existing Liquid Metal FBR LMFBR and Integral Fast Reactor designs LeadCooled Fast Reactor LFR based on Soviet naval propulsion units Supercritical Water Reactor SCWR based on existing LWR and supercritical boiler technology FBRs usually use a mixed oxide fuel core of up to 20 plutonium dioxide PuO2 and at least 80 uranium dioxide UO2 Another fuel option is metal alloys typically a blend of uranium plutonium and zirconium used because it is transparent to neutrons Enriched uranium can also be used on its own Many designs surround the core in a blanket of tubes that contain nonfissile uranium238 which by capturing fast neutrons from the reaction in the core converts to fissile plutonium239 as is some of the uranium in the core which is then reprocessed and used as nuclear fuel Other FBR designs rely on the geometry of the fuel itself which also contains uranium238 arranged to attain sufficient fast neutron capture The plutonium239 or the fissile uranium235 fission crosssection is much smaller in a fast spectrum than in a thermal spectrum as is the ratio between the PuU fission crosssection and the U absorption crosssection This increases the concentration of PuU needed to sustain a chain reaction as well as the ratio of breeding to fission On the other hand a fast reactor needs no moderator to slow down the neutrons at all taking advantage of the fast neutrons producing a greater number of neutrons per fission than slow neutrons For this reason ordinary liquid water being a moderator as well as a neutron absorber is an undesirable primary coolant for fast reactors Because large amounts of water in the core are required to cool the reactor the yield of neutrons and therefore breeding of Pu are strongly affected Theoretical work has been done on reduced moderation water reactors which may have a sufficiently fast spectrum to provide a breeding ratio slightly over 1 This would likely result in an unacceptable power derating and high costs in an liquidwatercooled reactor but the supercritical water coolant of the SCWR has sufficient heat capacity to allow adequate cooling with less water making a fastspectrum watercooled reactor a practical possibility The only commercially operating reactor as of 2015 is the BN600 reactor in Russia a 560MW sodium cooled reactor Integral fast reactor One design of fast neutron reactor specifically designed to address the waste disposal and plutonium issues was the integral fast reactor also known as an integral fast breeder reactor although the original reactor was designed to not breed a net surplus of fissile material To solve the waste disposal problem the IFR had an onsite electrowinning fuel reprocessing unit that recycled the uranium and all the transuranics not just plutonium via electroplating leaving just short halflife fission products in the waste Some of these fission products could later be separated for industrial or medical uses and the rest sent to a waste repository where they would not have to be stored for anywhere near as long as wastes containing long halflife transuranics The IFR pyroprocessing system uses molten cadmium cathodes and electrorefiners to reprocess metallic fuel directly onsite at the reactor Such systems not only commingle all the minor actinides with both uranium and plutonium they are compact and selfcontained so that no plutoniumcontaining material ever needs to be transported away from the site of the breeder reactor Breeder reactors incorporating such technology would most likely be designed with breeding ratios very close to 100 so that after an initial loading of enriched uranium andor plutonium fuel the reactor would then be refueled only with small deliveries of natural uranium metal A quantity of natural uranium metal equivalent to a block about the size of a milk crate delivered once per month would be all the fuel such a 1 gigawatt reactor would need Such selfcontained breeders are currently envisioned as the final selfcontained and selfsupporting ultimate goal of nuclear reactor designers The project was canceled in 1994 by United States Secretary of Energy Hazel OLeary Other fast reactors Another proposed fast reactor is a fast molten salt reactor in which the molten salts moderating properties are insignificant This is typically achieved by replacing the light metal fluorides eg LiF BeF2 in the salt carrier with heavier metal chlorides eg KCl RbCl ZrCl4 Several prototype FBRs have been built ranging in electrical output from a few light bulbs equivalent EBRI 1951 to over 1000 MWe As of 2006 the technology is not economically competitive to thermal reactor technology—but India Japan China South Korea and Russia are all committing substantial research funds to further development of Fast Breeder reactors anticipating that rising uranium prices will change this in the long term Germany in contrast abandoned the technology due to safety concerns The SNR300 fast breeder reactor was finished after 19 years despite cost overruns summing up to a total of 36 billion Euros only to then be abandoned As well as their thermal breeder program India is also developing FBR technology using both uranium and thorium feedstocks Thermal breeder reactor The advanced heavy water reactor AHWR is one of the few proposed largescale uses of thorium India is developing this technology their interest motivated by substantial thorium reserves almost a third of the worlds thorium reserves are in India which also lacks significant uranium reserves The third and final core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station 60 MWe reactor was a light water thorium breeder which began operating in 1977 It used pellets made of thorium dioxide and uranium233 oxide initially the U233 content of the pellets was 5–6 in the seed region 15–3 in the blanket region and none in the reflector region It operated at 236 MWt generating 60 MWe and ultimately produced over 21 billion kilowatt hours of electricity After five years the core was removed and found to contain nearly 14 more fissile material than when it was installed demonstrating that breeding from thorium had occurred The liquid fluoride thorium reactor LFTR is also planned as a thorium thermal breeder Liquidfluoride reactors may have attractive features such as inherent safety no need to manufacture fuel rods and possibly simpler reprocessing of the liquid fuel This concept was first investigated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment in the 1960s From 2012 it became the subject of renewed interest worldwide Japan China the UK as well as private US Czech and Australian companies have expressed intent to develop and commercialize the technology Discussion Like many aspects of nuclear power fast breeder reactors have been subject to much controversy over the years In 2010 the International Panel on Fissile Materials said After six decades and the expenditure of the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars the promise of breeder reactors remains largely unfulfilled and efforts to commercialize them have been steadily cut back in most countries In Germany the United Kingdom and the United States breeder reactor development programs have been abandoned The rationale for pursuing breeder reactors—sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit—was based on the following key assumptions It was expected that uranium would be scarce and highgrade deposits would quickly become depleted if fission power were deployed on a large scale the reality however is that since the end of the cold war uranium has been much cheaper and more abundant than early designers expected It was expected that breeder reactors would quickly become economically competitive with the lightwater reactors that dominate nuclear power today but the reality is that capital costs are at least 25 more than water cooled reactors It was thought that breeder reactors could be as safe and reliable as lightwater reactors but safety issues are cited as a concern with fast reactors that use a sodium coolant where a leak could lead to a sodium fire It was expected that the proliferation risks posed by breeders and their “closed” fuel cycle in which plutonium would be recycled could be managed But since plutonium breeding reactors produce plutonium from U238 and thorium reactors produce fissile U233 from thorium all breeding cycles could theoretically pose proliferation risks U232 which is always present in U233 produced in breeder reactors however is a strong alpha emitter and as such would make weapon handling extremely hazardous and the weapon easy to detect There are some past antinuclear advocates that have become pronuclear power as a clean source of electricity since breeder reactors effectively recycle most of their waste This solves one of the most important negative issues of nuclear power In the documentary Pandoras Promise a case is made for breeder reactors because they provide a real high kW alternative to fossil fuel energy According to the movie one pound of uranium provides as much energy as 5000 barrels of oil FBRs have been built and operated in the United States the United Kingdom France the former USSR India and Japan The experimental FBR SNR300 was built in Germany but never operated and eventually shut down amid political controversy following the Chernobyl disaster As of 2014 one such reactor was being used for power generation with another scheduled for early 2015 Several reactors are planned many for research related to the Generation IV reactor initiative Development and notable breeder reactors The Soviet Union comprising Russia and other countries dissolved in 1991 constructed a series of fast reactors the first being mercurycooled and fueled with plutonium metal and the later plants sodiumcooled and fueled with plutonium oxide BR1 1955 was 100W thermal was followed by BR2 at 100 kW and then the 5MW BR5 BOR60 first criticality 1969 was 60 MW with construction started in 1965 Future plants India has been an early leader in the FBR segment and is currently rolling out the next phase of their program In 2012 an FBR called the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor was under construction in India due to be completed that year with commissioning date known by midyear The FBR program of India includes the concept of using fertile thorium232 to breed fissile uranium233 India is also pursuing the thorium thermal breeder reactor A thermal breeder is not possible with purely uraniumplutonium based technology Thorium fuel is the strategic direction of the power program of India owing to the nations large reserves of thorium but worldwide known reserves of thorium are also some four times those of uranium Indias Department of Atomic Energy DAE said in 2007 that it would simultaneously construct four more breeder reactors of 500 MWe each including two at Kalpakkam BHAVINI an Indian nuclear power company was established in 2003 responsible for the construction commissioning and operation of all Stage II fast breeder reactors envisaged as part of the country’s three stage nuclear power programme The new Indian FBR600 is being used to advance these plans The FBR600 is a pooltype sodium cooled reactor with a rating of 600MWe and advanced active and passive safety features The China Experimental Fast Reactor CEFR is a 25 MWe prototype for the planned China Prototype Fast Reactor CFRP It started generating power on 21 July 2011 China also initiated a research and development project in thorium moltensalt thermal breeder reactor technology Liquid fluoride thorium reactor formally announced at the Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS annual conference in January 2011 Its ultimate target is to investigate and develop a thoriumbased molten salt nuclear system over about 20 years Kirk Sorensen former NASA scientist and Chief Nuclear Technologist at Teledyne Brown Engineering has long been a promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors In 2011 Sorensen founded Flibe Energy a company aimed to develop 20–50 MW LFTR reactor designs to power military bases South Korea is developing a design for a standardized modular FBR for export to complement the standardized PWR Pressurized Water Reactor and CANDU designs they have already developed and built but has not yet committed to building a prototype Russia has a plan for increasing its fleet of fast breeder reactors significantly A BN800 reactor 800 MWe at Beloyarsk was completed in 2012 succeeding a smaller BN600 In June 2014 the BN800 was started in the minimum power mode The reactor working at 35 of the nominal efficiency was pluggedin the energy network on 10 December 2015 Plans for the construction of an even larger BN1200 reactor 1200 MWe initially anticipated completion in 2018 with two additional BN1200 reactors built by the end of 2030 However in 2015 Rosenergoatom postponed construction indefinitely to allow fuel design to be improved after more experience of operating the BN800 reactor and amongst cost concerns An experimental leadcooled fast reactor BREST300 will be built at the Siberian Chemical Combine SCC in Seversk The BREST design is seen as a successor to the BN series and the 300 MWe unit at the SCC could be the forerunner to a 1200 MWe version for wide deployment as a commercial power generation unit The development program is as part of an Advanced Nuclear Technologies Federal Program 20102020 that seeks to exploit fast reactors as a way to be vastly more efficient in the use of uranium while burning radioactive substances that otherwise would have to be disposed of as waste BREST refers to bystry reaktor so svintsovym teplonositelem Russian for fast reactor with lead coolant Its core would measure about 23 metres in diameter by 11 metres in height and contain 16 tonnes of fuel The unit would be refuelled every year with each fuel element spending five years in total within the core Lead coolant temperature would be around 540 °C giving a high efficiency of 43 primary heat production of 700 MWt yielding electrical power of 300 MWe The operational lifespan of the unit could be 60 years The design is expected to be completed by NIKIET in 2014 for construction between 2016 and 2020 On February 16 2006 the US France and Japan signed an arrangement to research and develop sodiumcooled fast reactors in support of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership In April 2007 the Japanese government selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the core company in FBR development in Japan Shortly thereafter MHI started a new company Mitsubishi FBR Systems MFBR to develop and eventually sell FBR technology In September 2010 the French government allocated 6516 million euros to the Commissariat à lénergie atomique to finalize the design of Astrid Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration a 600 MW reactor design of the 4th generation to be operational in 2020 As of 2013 the UK had shown interest in the PRISM reactor and was working in concert with France to develop ASTRID In October 2010 GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the operators of the US Department of Energys Savannah River Site which should allow the construction of a demonstration plant based on the companys SPRISM fast breeder reactor prior to the design receiving full NRC licensing approval In October 2011 The Independent reported that the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority NDA and senior advisers within the Department for Energy and Climate Change DECC had asked for technical and financial details of the PRISM partly as a means of reducing the countrys plutonium stockpile The traveling wave reactor proposed in a patent by Intellectual Ventures is a fast breeder reactor designed to not need fuel reprocessing during the decadeslong lifetime of the reactor The breedburn wave in the TWR design does not move from one end of the reactor to the other but gradually from the inside out Moreover as the fuels composition changes through nuclear transmutation fuel rods are continually reshuffled within the core to optimize the neutron flux and fuel usage at any given point in time Thus instead of letting the wave propagate through the fuel the fuel itself is moved through a largely stationary burn wave This is contrary to many media reports which have popularized the concept as a candlelike reactor with a burn region that moves down a stick of fuel By replacing a static core configuration with an actively managed standing wave or soliton core TerraPowers design avoids the problem of cooling a highly variable burn region Under this scenario the reconfiguration of fuel rods is accomplished remotely by robotic devices the containment vessel remains closed during the procedure and there is no associated downtime See also Energy
