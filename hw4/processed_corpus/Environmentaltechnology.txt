 Envirotech redirects here For the Singaporebased company see United Envirotech For the Californiabased company see Envirotech company Environmental technology envirotech green technology greentech or clean technology cleantech is the application of one or more of environmental science green chemistry environmental monitoring and electronic devices to monitor model and conserve the natural environment and resources and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement The term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics wind turbines bioreactors etc Sustainable development is the core of environmental technologies The term environmental technologies is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources Examples Biofiltration Bioreactor Bioremediation Desalination Doubly fed electric machine Energy conservation Energy saving modules Electric vehicles Wave energy Green computing Hydroelectricity Wind power Wind turbine Hydrogen fuel cell Ocean thermal energy conversion Solar power Photovoltaic Thermal depolymerization Composting toilet Pyrolysis Main article Recycling Renewable energy Renewable energy is the energy that can be replenished easily For years we have been using sources such as wood sun water etc for means for producing energy Energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood sun wind etc is considered to be renewable Water purification Water purification The whole ideaconcept of having dirtgermpollution free water flowing throughout the environment Many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water Water pollution is the main enemy of this concept and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water Air purification Air purification Basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove CO2 and convert it into oxygen The best examples are Dypsis lutescens Sansevieria trifasciata and Epipremnum aureum Sewage treatment Sewage treatment is conceptually similar to water purification Sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution The most polluted water is not used for anything and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently It may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection sustainability etc Environmental remediation Environmental remediation is the removal of pollutants or contaminants for the general protection of the environment This is accomplished by various chemical biological and bulk movements encyclopedia of medical concepts Solid waste management Solid waste management is the purification consumption reuse disposal and treatment of solid waste that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a citytown eGain forecasting Egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future weathers impact on a building By adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast the system eliminates redundant use of heat thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases Energy conservation Energy conservation is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity Alternative and clean power Principles Green syndicalism Sustainability Sustainable design Sustainable engineering Scientists continue to search for clean energy alternatives to our current power production methods Some technologies such as anaerobic digestion produce renewable energy from waste materials The global reduction of greenhouse gases is dependent on the adoption of energy conservation technologies at industrial level as well as this clean energy generation That includes using unleaded gasoline solar energy and alternative fuel vehicles including plugin hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles Since industrial use of energy accounts for 51 of worldwide energy usage improving energy efficiency in this field is a top priority for environmental technology companies around the globe Advanced energy efficient electric motor and electric generator technology that are cost effective to encourage their application such as the brushless woundrotor doubly fed electric machine and energy saving module can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide CO2 and sulfur dioxide SO2 that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere if electricity is generated using fossil fuels Greasestock is an event held yearly in Yorktown Heights New York which is one of the largest showcases of environmental technology in the United States Education Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes Environmental Engineering or Environmental Systems courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment Environmental chemistry sustainable chemistry or environmental chemical engineering courses oriented towards understanding the effects good and bad of chemicals in the environment Such awards can focus on mining processes pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes Environmental technology courses oriented towards producing electronic electrical or electrotechnology graduates capable of developing devices and artefacts able to monitor measure model and control environmental impact including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources and developing novel energy generation technologies See also Sustainable Development portal Environment portal Earth sciences portal Ecology portal Appropriate technology Groasis
