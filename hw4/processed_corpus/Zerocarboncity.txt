 A zerocarbon city runs entirely on renewable energy it has no carbon footprint and will in this respect not cause harm to the planet Most cities throughout the world produce energy by burning coal oil and gas unintentionally emitting carbon Almost every activity humans do involves burning one of these fossil fuels To become a zero carbon city an established modern city must collectively reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to zero and all practices that emit greenhouse gases must cease Also renewable energy must supersede other nonrenewable energy sources and become the sole source of energy so a zerocarbon city is a renewableenergyeconomy city This transition which includes decarbonising electricity increasing the importance of the sources of renewable electricity and zeroemission transport is undertaken as a response to climate change Zerocarbon cities maintain optimal living conditions while eliminating environmental impact Instead of using established cities many developers are starting from scratch in order to create a zerocarbon city This way they can make sure every aspect of a city contributes to it being carbon free Cities aspiring to be Carbonfree There are two places that are prototyped to become zerocarbon cities Masdar City United Arab Emirates and Dongtan China Malacca also has a stated ambition to become a carbonfree city with a Low Carbon Cities programme being piloted in Malaysia as of 2014 Once created these cities will become living examples of sustainable development which demonstrate optimal resource utilization Masdar City One of the worlds first zerocarbon cities called Masdar City is being constructed in the Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi it is set to house 50000 people Construction began in February 2008 The desert city is designed to be powered entirely with renewable energy including solar power and wind power The Masdar Initiative is an environmental urban ambition by Foster Partners to develop a sustainable city where residents would enjoy a carbon and wastefree environment The 6 million square metre project is based on the principles of an ancient walled city combined with modern alternative energy technologies Critics say that the city concept appears cold and uninviting however this project “promises to question conventional urban wisdom at a fundamental level” Masdar promises to set new benchmarks for the sustainable city of the future” The city will be entirely selfsustaining Masdar CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber explained “ We are creating a synergetic environment it is a true alternative energy cluster Here you will find researchers students scientists business investment professionals and policy makers all within the same community It will be a living example of sustainable development that will position Abu Dhabi and Masdar at the forefront of intelligent resource utilization It will combine the talent expertise and resources to enable the technological breakthroughs necessary for truly sustainable development” Construction of this largescale project will occur in two phases In phase one a solar photovoltaic power plant will be built as a central energy source In phase two urban growth will occur The site is located in close proximity to Abu Dhabi’s transportation infrastructure which will allow for easy access to and from surrounding communities An efficient network of rail road and public transit will link the city to central Abu Dhabi and the international airport Dongtan Dongtan China is located at the east end of Chongming and is adjacent to the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve Seeing as this area is near wetlands some question its effects on the surrounding environment The director of the project Peter Head insists it will not affect the wetlands The developers plan on a fully built city with 80000 residents by 2020 Dongtan development plans include use of the ten principles of ecocities Adjacent to booming Shanghai plans are coming together for the prototypical city of Dongtan which designers argue would be the world’s first truly sustainable new urban development Londonbased Arup and the Shanghai Industrial Investment Corporation SIIC the city’s investment branch have partnered to create a master plan for Dongtan an area three quarters the size of Manhattan The brief calls for integrated sustainable urban planning and design to create a city as close to carbonneutral as possible within economic constraints Located in sensitive wetlands on Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River just north of Shanghai Dongtan’s first phase a marina village of 20000 inhabitants will be unveiled at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai By 2020 nearly 80000 people are expected to inhabit the city’s environmentally sustainable neighborhoods As a strategic partner Arup is responsible for a range of services including urban design sustainable energy management waste management renewable energy process implementation architecture infrastructure and even the planning of communities and social structures Peter Head director of Arup’s sustainable urban design leads the project for the firm from its London’s office during design Arup is offsetting the emissions of its team’s travel to and from the site in cooperation with emissions brokerage firm CO2e “Renewable energy will be used to reduce particulate CO2 emissions Transport vehicles will run on batteries or hydrogenfuel cells and not use any diesel or petrol creating a relatively quiet city” he explains Other priorities include recycling organic waste to reduce landfills and generate clean energy Head insists development won’t affect the wetlands “First of all water usually discharged into the river will be collected treated and recycled within the city boundaries” he says “There will be a 2mile buffer zone of ecofarm between city development and the wetlands” While farming is water intensive relatively small amounts of water reach the plants themselves Head says Dongtan “will capture and recycle water in the city and use recycled water to grow green vegetables hydroponically This makes the whole water cycle much more efficient Dongtan is expected to eventually be home to more than 500000 residents which is an insignificant number for a country of 13 billion people But the ambitious carbonneutral experiment of Dongtan is meant to be a model for development worldwide Initiatives Transport Cars will be banned within the city instead batterypowered and auto piloted personal rapid transit systems PRT will be used Visitors to the city must park their cars outside and use public transit In both prototypes there will be ideal conditions to encourage walking or cycling Additionally both Masdar City and Dongtan will be connected to their larger counterparts via rail or road Energy Ecocities are selfsufficient in energy They meet energy need through solar wind and biomass sources About 80 of energy will be solar energy it will be generated through photovoltaic panels concentrated solar collectors and solar thermal tubes In order to keep cooling costs down wind cooling towers and narrow streets will be put in these help to maximize shaded areas Planners in Dongtan are putting meters in each house to display energy use Guiding principles There are 10 principles that are proposed to create an ecocity The developers of Dongtan have used them in order to create a carbonfree city Revise land use priorities Revise transportation priorities Restore damaged urban environments Create decent safe and economically mixed housing Nurture social justice and create improved opportunities Support local agriculture Promote recycling and resource conservation Work with businesses to support ecologically sound economic activity Promote voluntary simplicity Increase awareness of the local environment See also Renewable energy sources Ecology movement Electric vehicle network Environmental movement Environmental
