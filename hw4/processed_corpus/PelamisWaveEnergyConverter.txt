 The Pelamis Wave Energy Converter was a technology that used the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity The machine was made up of connected sections which flex and bend as waves pass it is this motion which is used to generate electricity Developed by the now defunct Scottish company Pelamis Wave Power formerly Ocean Power Delivery the Pelamis became the first offshore wave machine to generate electricity into the grid when it was first connected to the UK grid in 2004 Pelamis Wave Power then went on to build and test five additional Pelamis machines three firstgeneration P1 machines which were tested in a farm off the coast of Portugal in 2009 and two secondgeneration machines the Pelamis P2 were tested off Orkney between 2010 and 2014 The company went into administration in November 2014 with the intellectual property transferred to the Scottish Government body Wave Energy Scotland Operation The Pelamis machine is an offshore wave energy converter operating in water depths greater than 50m The machine consists of a series of semisubmerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints As waves pass along the length of the machine the sections move relative to one another The waveinduced motion of the sections is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors via smoothing hydraulic accumulators The hydraulic motors drive electrical generators to produce electricity Electricity from all the joints is fed down a single umbilical cable to a junction on the sea bed Several devices can be connected and linked to shore through a single seabed cable Principle The Pelamis is an attenuating wave energy converter The machine responds to the curvature of the waves their shape rather than the wave height As waves can only reach a certain curvature before naturally breaking this limits the range of motion through which the machine must move but maintains large motion at the joints in small waves Projects P2 Pelamis Testing at EMEC The P2 Pelamis design was Pelamis Wave Powers second generation Pelamis machine The Pelamis P2 is 180m long 4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight Consisting of five tube sections and four flexible joints the design is longer and fatter than the previous P1 design In 2010 Pelamis Wave Power began tests of the first Pelamis P2 machine at the European Marine Energy Centre Orkney Scotland The machine was owned by the German utility company EON and was the UKs first commercial supply contract in the marine energy sector In March 2010 Pelamis Wave Power announced a second order for a P2 machine from ScottishPower Renewables part of Iberdrola Renovables This second machine was first installed at EMEC in May 2012 The two utility companies announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the P2 Pelamis technology Following the demise of the company the P2001 device was acquired by Wave Energy Scotland having completed over 15000 hours of operation The device was decommissioned in April 2016 The other device P2002 was sold to the European Marine Energy Centre for use as a test rig Projects Formerly in Development EON and ScottishPower Renewables announced plans to build larger projects using Pelamis machines in the waters off Orkneys west coast Both companies won leases in 2010 from The Crown Estate who own the seabed around the UK for projects of up to 50MW The Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters Leasing Round was the worlds first commercial scale wave and tidal energy leasing opportunity Development History Prototype Pelamis Machine Pelamis Wave Power tested their first fullscale prototype at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney Scotland between 2004 and 2007 The machine which was rated at 750 kW was the worlds first offshore wave power machine to generate electricity into the grid system The prototype was 120m long and 35m in diameter It consisted of four tube sections linked by three shorter and power conversion modules Aguçadoura Wave Farm Main article Aguçadoura Wave Farm In 2008 Pelamis tested three first generation P1 Pelamis waves at the Aguçadoura Wave Farm Located off the northwest coast of Portugal near Póvoa de Varzim the farm had an installed capacity of 225MW and was the worlds first multiple machine wave power project The project was part funded by Portuguese utility Enersis at the time owned by Australian global investment company Babcock Brown The farm first generated electricity in July 2008 but was taken offline in November 2008 at the same time as Babcock Brown encountered financial difficulties Etymology Pelamis platurus is a yellowbellied sea snake that lives in tropical and subtropical waters It prefers shallow inshore waters Images
