 The terms transition town transition initiative and transition model refer to grassroot community projects that aim to increase selfsufficiency to reduce the potential effects of peak oil climate destruction and economic instability The Transition Network founded in 2006 inspired the creation of many of the projects A number of the groups have officially registered with the organisation The first initiative to use the name was Transition Town Totnes located in the United Kingdom Transition initiatives have been started in locations around the world with many located in the United Kingdom Europe North America and Australia Etymology The term transition town was coined by Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne The transition model can be applied to different types of places where people live such as villages regions islands and towns The generic term is transition initiative which includes transition neighborhoods communities and cities although transition town is in common usage History From Kinsale to Totnes In 2004 permaculture designer Rob Hopkins set his students at Kinsale Further Education College the task of applying permaculture principles to the concept of peak oil The output of this student project was the ‘Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan This looked at acrosstheboard creative adaptations in the realms of energy production health education economy and agriculture as a road map to a sustainable future for the town Two of his students Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne developed the Transition towns concept They then presented their ideas to Kinsale Town Council The councilors decided to adopt the plan and work towards energy independence Hopkins moved to his hometown of Totnes England where he and Naresh Giangrande developed these concepts into the transition model In 2006 Transition Town Totnes become the first Transition initiative Transition Network founded Between late 2006 and early 2007 the Transition Network was founded as a UK charity by British permaculture educator Rob Hopkins It trains and supports people involved with Transition initiatives It disseminates the concepts of transition towns 2008 to present day In 2008 the number of communities involved in the project had increased with many localities in the process of becoming official Transition towns The initiative spread and by May 2010 there were over 400 community initiatives recognized as official Transition towns in the United Kingdom Ireland Canada Australia New Zealand the United States Italy and Chile The term transition initiatives become common

Designers Manual 1988 and David Holmgren’s Permaculture Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability 2003 as well as David Flemings work on community culture and resilience Organization Each Transition town or initiative has a high level of autonomy However to be called an official initiative certain criteria must be met Additionally there is nothing to stop an unofficial initiative using ideas inspired by Transition towns Further there are various hubs to coordinate work at a regional level Transition Network The Transition Network is a UK charity founded between late 2006 and early 2007 It was set up to disseminate the concept of the Transition towns It has published books and films trained people and facilitated networking The networks website contains a listing of the initiatives that have registered there Some of the material has been translated and adapted to other languagescultures including Portuguese Danish German Dutch Spanish French Hungarian Italian Japanese and Irish Transition US In the United States Transition initiatives have been started in many communities Transition US is the national hub Its stated vision that every community in the United States will have engaged its collective creativity to unleash an extraordinary and historic transition to a future beyond fossil fuels a future that is more vibrant abundant and resilient one that is ultimately preferable to the present Transition US is a resource and catalyst for building resilient communities across the United States that are able to withstand severe energy climate or economic shocks while creating a better quality of life in the process They are accomplishing this mission by inspiring encouraging supporting networking and training individuals and their communities as they consider adopt adapt and implement the transition approach to community empowerment and change A large number of state sites have also been set up using the Ning social networking platform These state sites under the umbrella of a national Ning site were set up to help facilitate network inform monitor and house regional and organizational Transition initiatives Thus furthering the spread of the Transition Movement while networking related organizations projects ideas and activities In addition many Transition initiatives can be found on the WiserEarth community Guidance for new groups Some projects use the TNs guide the 12 ingredients or the revised ingredients when setting up their group Features The Transition Network TN promotes awareness of sustainable living and building local ecological resilience Peak oil and local resilience The Transition Handbook From Oil Dependency to Local Resiliency by Rob Hopkins provides much of the framework behind the Transition Initiative and outlines ways for local Transition Towns to get involved Transportation Communities are encouraged to seek out methods for reducing energy usage as well as reducing their reliance on long supply chains that are totally dependent on fossil fuels for essential items see environmental calculator Food production Food is a key area for transition sometimes the slogan Food feet not food miles is used Initiatives so far have included creating community gardens or replacing ornamental tree plantings with fruit or nut trees to grow food Waste and recycling Business waste exchange seeks to match the waste of one industry with another industry that uses that waste material sometimes referred to as industrial symbiosis Repairing old items rather than throwing them away is looked at Psychology The Transition Network proposes an alternative from business as usual or from shockeddoomladen reactions to peak oil and an end to unlimited economic growth According to SouthendonSea in Transition by shifting our mindset we can actually recognise the coming postcheap oil era as an opportunity rather than a threat and design the future low carbon age to be thriving resilient and abundant — somewhere much better to live than our current alienated consumer culture based on greed war and the myth of perpetual growth A theme of the Transition Network is acknowledging the emotional impact of changing to a low energy world Some Transition Network groups have Heart and Soul groups to look at this aspect Energy descent action plans EDAP An important aim for Transition towns is to reduce dependency on fossil fuels One way to further this goal is for the community to develop an EDAP The term community in this context includes local people local institutions local agencies and the local council The first comprehensive plan was created for Totnes in 2010 entitled Transition in Action Totnes District 2030 In France where the movement is called Villes et Territoires en Transition the association négaWatt provides a theoretical support to the transition movement Economics As of 2010 the TN includes the global financial crisis as further threat to local communities alongside peak oil and climate change To counter economic instability the TN promotes fiscal localism The organisation see local complementary currencies as a way to create sustainable local economies Local currencies existing or under development include Methods While the focus and aims remain the same the methods used to achieve these vary For example Totnes has introduced its own local currency the Totnes pound which is redeemable in local shops and businesses helping to reduce food miles while also supporting local firms This idea is also planned to be introduced in three Welsh transition towns and in Maleny Australia the Baroon Dollar as a part of a regional transition towns project In popular culture Transition towns have been featured in the plot line of the longrunning BBC Radio 4 series The Archers This is an example of mainstream media attention the movement got after a couple of years of being founded Publications Books A number of books have been
