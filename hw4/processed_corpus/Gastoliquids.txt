 Gas to liquids GTL is a refinery process to convert natural gas or other gaseous hydrocarbons into longerchain hydrocarbons such as gasoline or diesel fuel Methanerich gases are converted into liquid synthetic fuels either via direct conversion—using noncatalytic processes that convert methane to methanol in one step—or via syngas as an intermediate such as in the Fischer Tropsch Mobil and syngas to gasoline plus processes Fischer–Tropsch process Main article Fischer–Tropsch process The Fischer–Tropsch process starts with partial oxidation of methane natural gas to carbon dioxide carbon monoxide hydrogen gas and water The ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen is adjusted using the water gas shift reaction while the excess carbon dioxide is removed with aqueous solutions of alkanolamines or physical solvents Removing the water yields synthesis gas syngas which is chemically reacted over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons and other byproducts Oxygen is provided from a cryogenic air separation unit Methane to methanol process Methanol is made from methane natural gas in a series of three reactions The methanol thus formed may be converted to gasoline by the Mobil process Methanol to gasoline process MTG In the early 1970s Mobil developed an alternative procedure in which natural gas is converted to syngas and then methanol The methanol polymerized over a zeolite catalyst to form alkanes First methanol is dehydrated to give dimethyl ether This is then further dehydrated over a zeolite catalyst such as ZSM5 which would theoretically yield ethylene but which in practice is polymerized and hydrogenated to give a gasoline with hydrocarbons of five or more carbon atoms making up 80 of the fuel by weight Syngas to gasoline plus process STG Main article Syngas to gasoline plus A third gastoliquids process builds on the MTG technology by converting natural gasderived syngas directly into dropin gasoline and jet fuel via a thermochemical singleloop process The STG process follows four principal steps in one continuous process loop This process consists of four fixed bed reactors in series in which a syngas is converted to synthetic fuels The steps for producing highoctane synthetic gasoline are as follows Methanol Synthesis Syngas is fed to Reactor 1 the first of four reactors which converts most of the syngas CO and H2 to methanol CH3OH when passing through the catalyst bed Dimethyl Ether DME Synthesis The methanolrich gas from Reactor 1 is next fed to Reactor 2 the second STG reactor The methanol is exposed to a catalyst and much of it is converted to DME which involves a dehydration from methanol to form DME CH3OCH3 Gasoline synthesis The Reactor 2 product gas is next fed to Reactor 3 the third reactor containing the catalyst for conversion of DME to hydrocarbons including paraffins alkanes aromatics naphthenes cycloalkanes and small amounts of olefins alkenes mostly from C6 number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule to C10 Gasoline Treatment The fourth reactor provides transalkylation and hydrogenation treatment to the products coming from Reactor 3 The treatment reduces durene tetramethylbenzeneisodurene and trimethylbenzene components that have high freezing points and must be minimized in gasoline As a result the synthetic gasoline product has high octane and desirable viscometric properties Separator Finally the mixture from Reactor 4 is condensed to obtain gasoline The noncondensed gas and gasoline are separated in a conventional condenserseparator Most of the noncondensed gas from the product separator becomes recycled gas and is sent back to the feed stream to Reactor 1 leaving the synthetic gasoline product composed of paraffins aromatics and naphthenes Commercial uses Using gastoliquids processes refineries can convert some of their gaseous waste products flare gas into valuable fuel oils which can be sold as is or blended only with diesel fuel The World Bank estimates that over 150 billion cubic metres 53×10 cu ft of natural gas are flared or vented annually an amount worth approximately 306 billion equivalent to 25 of the United States gas consumption or 30 of the European Unions annual gas consumption a resource that could be useful using GTL Gastoliquids processes may also be used for the economic extraction of gas deposits in locations where it is not economical to build a pipeline This process will be increasingly significant as crude oil resources are depleted The use of microchannel reactors such as those developed by INFRA Technology or Velocys shows promise for the conversion of unconventional remote and problem gas into valuable liquid fuels GTL plants based on microchannel reactors are significantly smaller than those using conventional fixed bed or slurry bed reactors enabling modular plants that can be deployed cost effectively in remote locations and on smaller fields than is possible with competing systems Construction is underway for one such plant ENVIA Energys Oklahoma City GTL plant being built adjacent to Waste Managements East Oak landfill site The project is being financed by a joint venture between Waste Management NRG Energy Ventech and Velocys The feedstock for this plant will be a combination of landfill gas and pipeline natural gas On August 1 2014 Biofuels Power Corporation BFLS signed a letter of intent with ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions and Liberty GTL Inc to build a small scale gastoliquid demonstration facility in HoustonTexas The parties have established a nonbinding target date to complete installation and commissioning of the GTL Pilot Plant on or before December 31 2014 The purpose of the GTL Pilot Plant is to commercially demonstrate converting stranded natural gas resources to synthetic crude oil BFLS will operate the GTL Pilot Plant for the 2year demonstration ThyssenKrupp will provide technical services and contribute a previously operating autothermal reformer pilot plant of proven design “ATR” which will be used to generate synthesis gas feedstock for the production of synthetic crude oil Liberty will provide intellectual property and operating knowhow regarding crude oil synthesis along with the relevant catalyst supply The Liberty technical team is also credited for designing the FT Fischer Tropsch Reactor which will convert the synthetic gas to synthetic crude oil The GTL Pilot Plant will be assembled at the Houston Clean Energy Park which is an industrial estate owned by BFLS The Houston site is located between the Eagle Ford Natural Gas Field and numerous refineries One other proposed solution is to use a novel FPSO for offshore conversion of gas to liquids such as methanol diesel petrol synthetic crude and naphtha Two companies SASOL and Royal Dutch Shell have technology proven to work on a commercial scale PetroSA completed semicommercial demonstrations of gastoliquids used by the company in 2011 Royal Dutch Shell produces a diesel from natural gas in a factory in Bintulu Malaysia Another Shell GTL facility is the Pearl GTL plant in Qatar the worlds largest GTL facility and there are reports that Shell is looking at the feasibility of a GTL facility in Louisiana US SASOL has recently built the Oryx GTL facility in Ras Laffan Industrial City Qatar and together with Uzbekneftegaz and Petronas builds the Uzbekistan GTL plant Chevron Corporation in a joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is commissioning the Escravos GTL in Nigeria which uses Sasol technology On 1 February 2008 an Airbus A380 flew a threehour test flight between Britain and France with one of the A380s four RollsRoyce Trent 900 engines using a mix of 60 standard jet kerosene and 40 gas to liquids fuel supplied by Shell The aircraft engine needed no modification to use the GTL fuel which was designed to be mixed with normal jet fuel The fuel used was no cleaner in CO2 terms than standard fuel but it had local air quality benefits because the GTL portion contains no sulphur On 12 October 2009 a Qatar Airways Airbus A340600 conducted the worlds first commercial passenger flight using a mixture of kerosene and synthetic GTL fuel in its flight from Londons Gatwick Airport to Doha Brazilian oil company Petrobras has ordered two small experimental GTL production facilities intended to be posted at offshore oil fields too distant or deep to justify gas pipelines to onshore GTL plant In January 2012 Petrobras Cenpes Research and Development Centre approved for commercial deployment the technology supplied by UKbased gastoliquids company CompactGTL Petrobras has also completed its assessment of technology supplied by Velocys The STG technology is currently operating at precommercial scale in Hillsborough New Jersey at a plant owned by alternative fuels company Primus Green Energy The plant produces approximately 100000 gallons of highquality dropin gasoline per year directly from natural gas Further the company announced the findings of an independent engineer’s report prepared by E3 Consulting which found that STG system and catalyst performance exceeded expectations during plant operation The precommercial demonstration plant has also achieved 720 hours of continuous operation On March 2 2016 INFRA Technology LLC held a groundbreaking ceremony for
