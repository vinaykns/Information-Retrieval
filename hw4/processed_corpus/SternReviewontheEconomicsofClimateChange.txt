 The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change is a 700page report released for the Government of the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006 by economist Nicholas Stern chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics LSE and also chair of the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy CCCEP at Leeds University and LSE The report discusses the effect of global warming on the world economy Although not the first economic report on climate change it is significant as the largest and most widely known and discussed report of its kind The Review states that climate change is the greatest and widestranging market failure ever seen presenting a unique challenge for economics The Review provides prescriptions including environmental taxes to minimise the economic and social disruptions The Stern Reviews main conclusion is that the benefits of strong early action on climate change far outweigh the costs of not acting The Review points to the potential impacts of climate change on water resources food production health and the environment According to the Review without action the overall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5 of global gross domestic product GDP each year now and forever Including a wider range of risks and impacts could increase this to 20 of GDP or more also indefinitely Stern believes that 5–6 degrees of temperature increase is a real possibility The Review proposes that one percent of global GDP per annum is required to be invested to avoid the worst effects of climate change In June 2008 Stern increased the estimate for the annual cost of achieving stabilisation between 500 and 550 ppm CO2e to 2 of GDP to account for faster than expected climate change There has been a mixed reaction to the Stern Review from economists Several economists have been critical of the Review for example a paper by Byatt et al 2006 describes the Review as deeply flawed Some economists such as Brad DeLong and John Quiggin have supported the Review Others have criticised aspects of Reviews analysis but argued that some of its conclusions might still be justified based on other grounds eg see papers by Martin Weitzman 2007 and Dieter Helm 2008 Summary of the Reviews main conclusions The executive summary states The benefits of strong early action on climate change outweigh the costs The scientific evidence points to increasing risks of serious irreversible impacts from climate change associated with businessasusual BAU paths for emissions Climate change threatens the basic elements of life for people around the world – access to water food production health and use of land and the environment The impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed – the poorest countries and people will suffer earliest and most And if and when the damages appear it will be too late to reverse the process Thus we are forced to look a long way ahead Climate change may initially have small positive effects for a few developed countries but it is likely to be very damaging for the much higher temperature increases expected by midtolate century under BAU scenarios Integrated assessment modelling provides a tool for estimating the total impact on the economy our estimates suggest that this is likely to be higher than previously suggested Emissions have been and continue to be driven by economic growth yet stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere is feasible and consistent with continued growth Central estimates of the annual costs of achieving stabilisation between 500 and 550ppm CO2e are around 1 of global GDP if we start to take strong action now It would already be very difficult and costly to aim to stabilise at 450ppm CO2e If we delay the opportunity to stabilise at 500550ppm CO2e may slip away The transition to a lowcarbon economy will bring challenges for competitiveness but also opportunities for growth Policies to support the development of a range of lowcarbon and highefficiency technologies are required urgently Establishing a carbon price through tax trading or regulation is an essential foundation for climate change policy Creating a broadly similar carbon price signal around the world and using carbon finance to accelerate action in developing countries are urgent priorities for international cooperation Adaptation policy is crucial for dealing with the unavoidable impacts of climate change but it has been underemphasised in many countries An effective response to climate change will depend on creating the conditions for international collective action There is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change if strong collective action starts now Background On 19 July 2005 the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced that he had asked Sir Nicholas Stern to lead a major review of the economics of climate change to understand more comprehensively the nature of the economic challenges and how they can be met in the UK and globally The Stern Review was prepared by a team of economists at HM Treasury independent academics were involved as consultants only The scientific content of the Review was reviewed by experts from the Walker Institute The Stern review was not released for regular peerreview since the UK Government doesnt undertake peer review on commissioned reviews Papers were published and presentations held that outlined the approach in the months preceding the release Positive critical response The Stern Review attracted positive attention from several sectors Pia Hansen a European Commission Spokeswoman said doing nothing is not an option we must act now Simon Retallack of the UK think tank IPPR said This Review removes the last refuge of the donothing approach on climate change particularly in the US Tom Delay of The Carbon Trust said The Review offers a huge business opportunity Richard Lambert Director General of the Confederation of British Industry said that a global system of carbon trading is urgently needed Charlie Kronick of Greenpeace said Now the government must act and among other things invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation Asset managers FC look to the business opportunities and say this is an unprecedented opportunity to generate real value for our clients Brendan Barber General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress was optimistic about the opportunities for industry to meet demands created by investment in technology to combat climate change The Prince of Wales Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change formed by 14 of UKs leading companies shared this hope Chairman of Shell UK James Smith expressed the hope of the group that business and Government would discuss how Britain could obtain first mover advantage in what he described as massive new global market On 1 November 2006 then Australian Prime Minister John Howard responded by announcing that A60 million would be allotted to projects to help cut greenhouse gas emissions while reiterating that Australia would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol Much of this funding was directed at the nonrenewable coal industry British Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the Review demonstrated that scientific evidence of global warming was overwhelming and its consequences disastrous if the world failed to act The UK Treasury which commissioned the report simultaneously published a document of favourable comments on the Review Those quoted include Paul Wolfowitz former President of the World Bank Claude Mandil Executive Director of the International Energy Agency Kirit Parikh Member Planning Commission Government of India Adair Turner Former Director of UK Confederation of British Industry and Economic Advisor to Sustainable Development Commission Sir Rod Eddington Adviser to the UK Government on the long term links between transport and economic growth and former chief executive of British Airways Several academic economists are also quoted praising the Review see Response of economists Unfavorable critical response The Stern Review has received various critical responses Some economists have argued that the Review overestimates the present value of the costs of climate change and underestimates the costs of emission reduction Other critics have argued that the economic cost of the proposals put forward by Stern would be severe or that the scientific consensus view on global warming on which Stern relied is incorrect By contrast some argue that the Review emission reduction targets are too weak and that the climate change damage estimates in the Review are too small General criticisms In an article in the Daily Telegraph 2006 Ruth Lea Director of the Centre for Policy Studies questions the scientific consensus on climate change on which the Stern Review is based She says that authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change ie carbon emissions to have a predictable effect in magnitude or even direction Lea questions the longterm economic projections made in the Review commenting that economic forecasts for just two or three years ahead are usually wrong Lea goes on to describe the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as monumentally complex and doubts whether the international cooperation on climate change as argued for in the Review is really possible In conclusion Lea says that the real motive behind the Review is to justify increased tax on fuels Yohe and Tol 2007 described Leas article as a climate sceptics scattershot approach aiming to confuse the public by questioning the causal role of CO2 by emphasising the complexity of making economic predictions and by attributing a motive for Sterns conclusions Miles Templeman DirectorGeneral of the Institute of Directors said Without countries like the US China or India making decisive commitments UK competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer if we act alone This would be bad for business bad for the economy and ultimately bad for our climate Prof Bill McGuire of Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre said that Stern may have greatly underestimated the effects of global warming David Brown and Leo Peskett of the Overseas Development Institute a UK thinktank on international development argued that the key proposals in relation to how to use forests to tackle climate change may prove difficult to implement Radical ideas are needed not only at the level of understandings but also of forward strategies The Stern Review is much stronger on the former than the latter and leaves a lot of questions unanswered on implementation particularly the downstream practicalities of bringing avoided deforestation into climate mitigation efforts Soon after publication of the Stern Review former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson gave a lecture at the Centre for Policy Studies briefly criticising the Review and warning of what he called ecofundamentalism In 2008 Lawson gave evidence before the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee criticising the Review Environmental writer Bjørn Lomborg criticised the Stern Review in OpinionJournal Mr Sterns core argument that the price of inaction would be extraordinary and the cost of action modest falls apart when one actually reads the 700page tome Despite using many good references the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change is selective and its conclusion flawed Its fearmongering arguments have been sensationalized which is ultimately only likely to make the world worse off Reason magazines science correspondent Ronald Bailey describes the destructive character of the Stern Reviews policy proposals saying that Surely it is reasonable to argue that if one wants to help future generations deal with climate change the best policies would be those that encouraged economic growth This would endow future generations with the wealth and superior technologies that could be used to handle whatever comes at them including climate change So hurrying the process of switching from carbonbased fuels along by boosting energy costs means that humanity will have to delay buying other good things such as clean water better sanitation more and better food and more education Commenting on the Reviews suggested increases in environmental tax the British Chambers of Commerce have pointed to the dangers to business of additional taxation Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute a United States libertarian thinktank criticised Sterns conclusion taking a calculation by himself Sterns investment advice makes sense only if you think that warming will hammer GDP by 10 a year You dont gain much at all from emission cuts however if you think GDP will only drop by 5 a year if we do nothing And if you think warming will only cost the global economy 2 of GDP every year then Sterns investment advice is sheer lunacy In the BBC radio programme The Investigation a number of economists and scientists argued that Stern assumptions in the Review are far more pessimistic than those made by most experts in the field and that the Reviews conclusions are at odds with the mainstream view Cox and Vadon 2007 In his paper on the Jevons Paradox which states that improvements in energyefficiency of technologies can potentially increase greenhouse gas emission Steve Sorrel concludes with A prerequisite for all the above is a recognition that rebound effects matter and need to be taken seriously Something is surely amiss when such indepth and comprehensive studies as the Stern2007 review overlook this topic altogether John Bellamy Foster Brett Clark and Richard York in the Ecological Rift 2010 give considerable attention to the Stern Review noting that the targets of 550 ppm imply a global temperature increase of at least 3 °C well beyond what climate science consider dangerous and which would bring the earths average global temperature to a height last seen in the middle Pliocene around 3 million years ago p 154 They posit that the basis for such high targets is economics pure and simple p 155 that is lower emissions cuts were seen by the Stern Review authors as prohibitive destabilizing capitalism itself p 155 All of this signals that any reduction in C02 equivalent emissions beyond around 1 percent per year would make it virtually impossible to maintain strong economic growth—the bottom line of the capitalism economy Consequently in order to keep the treadmill of accumulation going the world needs to risk environmental Armageddon p 156 Claims that scientific consensus is incorrect or does not exist A paper by Carter et al 2006 sets out a scientific critique of the Review Martin Livermore of the Scientific Alliance a British industryfriendly organisation that promotes biotechnology genetically modified food and climate change scepticism has said that climate is not driven primarily by human use of fossil fuels and that the money to be spent is unlikely to have much effect it would be better spent on the worlds poor This criticism is an example of climate change denial scientists actually agree that current global warming is of primarily anthropogenic origin Stern report misused climate change study According to the Sunday Times article Climate change study was misused the Stern report misused disaster analysts research by Robert MuirWood head of research at Risk Management Solutions a USbased consultancy The Stern report citing MuirWood said “New analysis based on insurance industry data has shown that weatherrelated catastrophe losses have increased by 2 each year since the 1970s over and above changes in wealth inflation and population growthmovement … If this trend continued or intensified with rising global temperatures losses from extreme weather could reach 05–1 of world GDP by the middle of the century According to MuirWood said his research showed no such thing and accused Stern of going far beyond what was an acceptable extrapolation of the evidence Response of economists Discounting See also Economics of climate change mitigation § Discount rates One of the issues debated among economists was the discount rate used in the Review Discounting is used by economists to compare economic impacts occurring at different times Discounting was used by Stern in his calculation of the possible economic damages of future climate change Marginal climate change damages were calculated for a businessasusual greenhouse gas GHG emissions pathway Residual climate change damages at the margin were also calculated for two other emissions pathways one associated with a 450 ppm CO2e GHG concentration There are four main reasons commonly proposed by economists for placing a lower value on consumption occurring in the future rather than in the present future consumption should be discounted simply because it takes place in the future and people generally prefer the present to the future inherent discounting consumption levels will be higher in the future so the marginal utility of additional consumption will be lower future consumption levels are uncertain improved technology of the future will make it easier to address global warming concerns Using a high discount rate decreases the assessed benefit of actions designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions The Stern Review did not use a single discount rate but applied a stochastic approach whereby the discount rate varied with the expected outcomes reflecting the interaction between growth and the elasticity of marginal utility in line with Frank Ramseys growth model The Stern Reviews average discount rate for climate change damages is approximately 14 which at the time of the Review was lower than that used in most previous economic studies on climate change However accounting for risk in the stochastic framework means thus mean expected or certainty equivalent discount rate will be below the discount rate for the mean expected outcome Dietz 2008 p 11 In other words accounting for risk means a greater weight is applied to worst case outcomes as per the insurance market Inherent discounting Debate over the Stern Review initially focused on the first of these points In the Review Stern used a social discount rate based on the Ramsey formula which includes a term for inherent discounting also called the pure rate of time preference PTPrate s  γ  η g where s is the social discount rate γ the PTPrate η the marginal elasticity of utility and g the rate of growth of percapita consumption Dietz 2008 p 10 Stern accepts the case for discounting but argues that applying a PTPrate of anything much more than zero to social policy choice is ethically inappropriate His view is supported by a number of economists including Geoffrey Heal Thomas SternerWilliam Cline and Brad DeLong Cline wrote a book on global warming published in 1992 where he made similar ethical choices to Stern for discounting DeLong echoing Frank Ramsey and Tjalling Koopmans wrote My view—which I admit may well be wrong—of this knotty problem is that we are impatient in the sense of valuing the present and nearfuture much more than we value the distant future but that we shouldnt do so Hal Varian stated that the choice of discount rate was an inherently ethical judgement for which there was no definitive answer William Nordhaus of Yale University who has done several studies on the economics of global warming criticised the Review for its use of a low discount rate The Review’s unambiguous conclusions about the need for extreme immediate action will not survive the substitution of assumptions that are more consistent with today’s marketplace real interest rates and savings rates Hence the central questions about globalwarming policy—how much how fast and how costly—remain open The Review informs but does not answer these fundamental questions The difference between Sterns estimates and those of Nordhaus can largely though not entirely be explained by the difference in the PTPrate Previous studies by Nordhaus and others have adopted PTPrates of up to 3 per cent implying that other things being equal an environmental cost or benefit occurring 25 years in the future is worth about half as much as the same benefit today Richard Tol argues that in estimating discounting rates and the consequent social cost of carbon the assumptions that must be made about the remote future are so uncertain that they are essentially arbitrary Consequently the assumptions made dominate the results and with a low discount rate the social cost of carbon is also arbitrary In an appearance before the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee 2008 Stern was asked about the discount rate used in the Review Stern We are in pretty good company here in that the distinguished economists Solow Sen Keynes Ramsey and all kinds of people have adopted the approach to pure time discounting that we have adopted It is not particularly unusual John Roemer Humberto Llavador and Joaquim Silvestre have argued that an analysis of the problem must consider both the ethical and economic issues associated with discounting They have made the claim that high rates of discounting as the ones proposed by Nordhaus are only consistent with the infinitelylivedrepresentativeagent approach to economic modelling Intergenerational justice would require more realistic assumption one particular view is what they call the sustainabilitarian approach which seeks to maximise present consumption subject to the constraint that future generations enjoy a quality of life at least as good as that enjoyed by the current generation They support the discount factors used in the Stern analysis particularly the view that discounting should reflect only the probability that the world will end at a given future date and not the impatience of an infinitely lived representative consumer Treatment of uncertainty Uncertainty about future consumption may be addressed either through adjustments to the discount rate or by replacing uncertain flows of consumption with certainty equivalent flows Stern adopted the latter approach but was criticised by Tol and Yohe 2006 for double counting a claim rejected by the Stern Review team Dietz et al 2007 pp 138–139 Whilst critical of Sterns discounting Martin Weitzman has argued that standard discounting procedures are inherently incapable of dealing with extreme lowprobability events such as the risk of catastrophic climate change Future consumption will be higher With increasing average consumption in future the marginal utility of consumption will decline The elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption part of the social discount rate may be interpreted as a measure of aversion to inequality Partha Dasgupta has criticised the Stern Review for parametric choices that he argues are inadequately sensitive to inequality In subsequent debate Stern has conceded the case for a higher elasticity but noted that this would call for much more extensive redistribution of income within the current generation Dietz et al 2007 pp 135–137 Improved technology As far as discounting is concerned the effects of improved technology work through increased consumption and do not need to be treated separately However specification of an optimal response to climate change will depend on assumptions about improvements in technology and the extent to which such improvements will be induced by policies that increase the cost of emissions Market rates Both supporters and opponents of Sterns discount rate have used comparisons with market rates of return on capital to justify their position Robert Mendelsohn of Yale University is a critic of the Review and has said investments in mitigation that cannot even earn a positive rate of return will be worth far less to future generations than those same dollars invested in the market Placing climate change before investments in other important nonmarket services such as conservation health education security and transportation also cannot be justified in the name of future generations From the perspective of future generations it is in their interest that all investments earn the same rate of return The ethical justification for intentionally overspending on selective projects with low rates of return is weak indeed Nordhaus has been very critical of the Ramsey zero pure time preference on the basis of utilitarian ethical stance He takes a strictly market based view of intergenerational projects arguing that the social rate of time preference reflects the rate of return observed in the marketplace Nordhaus also raised his view that the present generation will have to forgo a large amount of consumption now for the benefit of future generations who will be much richer than the present generation Dasgupta argues that there is some confusion in the Stern review about the underlying rationale for the selection of the Ramsey parameters He states that the review mixes both market returns on investment with parameters selected on ethical grounds The discount rate chosen by Stern is close to the real interest rate for government bonds The higher rates preferred by Sterns critics are closer to the weighted average cost of capital for private investment see the extensive review by Frederick et al 2002 According to Quiggin the difference between the two is determined by the equity premium Quiggin says that there is no generally accepted theory accounting for the observed magnitude of the equity premium and hence no easy way of determining which approach if either should be regarded as the appropriate market comparator General comments HM Treasury have issued a document where several economists are quoted praising the Stern Review includingRobert Solow James Mirrlees Amartya Sen Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs Sachs and Stiglitz have also written favourable articles on the Review Richard Tol an environmental economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute is highly critical of the Stern Review and has said that If a student of mine were to hand in this report the Stern Review as a Masters thesis perhaps if I were in a good mood I would give him a D for diligence but more likely I would give him an F for fail Cox and Vadon 2007 There is a whole range of very basic economics mistakes that somebody who claims to be a Professor of Economics simply should not make Stern consistently picks the most pessimistic for every choice that one can make He overestimates through cherrypicking he double counts particularly the risks and he underestimates what development and adaptation will do to impacts Tol has referred to the Stern Review as populist science In a paper published in 2008 Tol showed that the Stern Reviews estimate of the social cost of carbon SCC along a businessasusual emissions pathway was an outlier in the economics literature Harvard economist Martin Weitzman has written a paper on the Stern Review Weitzman 2007 In this paper Weitzman described himself as skeptical in regards to the discount rate used by Stern in the Reviews formal aggregated assessment of climate change One of Weitzmans conclusions was that Stern deserved credit for increasing public awareness on the dangers of climate change However Weitzman also commented that in my opinion Stern deserves a measure of discredit for giving readers an authoritativelooking impression that seemingly objective bestavailablepractice professional economic analysis robustly supports its conclusions instead of more openly disclosing the full extent to which the Reviews radical policy recommendations depend upon controversial extreme assumptions and unconventional discount rates that most mainstream economists would consider much too low According to a paper Yohe and Tol 2007 the Stern Review is right for the wrong reasons At a seminar held in 2006 Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta commented on the Stern Review Dasgupta 2006 p 1 described the Review as a long and impressive document but felt that the authors had treated the issue of intergenerational equity via the social discount rate cavalierly Dasgupta 2006 pp 6–7 accepted the Reviews argument for a PTPrate of 01 but did not accept Sterns choice of 1 for the elasticity of marginal utility He argued this point by calculating a saving rate of 975 based on the Reviews values for the PTPrate and elasticity of marginal utility Dasgupta stated that a 975 savings rate is so patently absurd that we must reject it out of hand The calculation by Dasgupta was based on a model which had a deterministic economy constant population and no technological change Dasguptas calculation was later cited by Berkeley economist Hal Varian Writing in the New York Times newspaper Varian commented Sir Parthas strippeddown model leaves out uncertainty technological change and population growth but even so such a high savings rate is totally implausible Varian also questioned whether or not it was ethical for the current generation to transfer wealth to future generations via investment in mitigation who given Sterns assumptions would be much wealthier than we presently are Smith 2009 responded to Dasguptas criticism of the Stern Reviews implied savings rate She showed that the rates of PTP and risk aversion in the Stern Review are consistent with saving rates of 25–32 rather than 975 when a macroeconomic model with the production function actually used by Stern and Nordhaus is used According to Dietz 2008 pp 10–11 Varians analysis had apparently confused the PTPrate with the social discount rate The PTPrate if positive discounts the welfare of future generations even if they are poorer than the current generation The social discount rate used by Stern however accounts for the possible increased wealth consumption of future generations through the product ηg see the formula cited in the section on inherent discounting Terry Barker of the Tyndall Centre Climate Change Research wrote a paper Barker 2008 supportive of the Review Barker was critical of how some economists have applied costbenefit analysis to climate change the Stern Review considers costbenefit analysis as a marginal analysis inappropriately applied to a nonmarginal multidisciplinary systemic problem p 50 Both Stern p 163 and the IPCC Reports after 1995 take a multicriteria approach rather than a narrowly monetary one and question costbenefit analysis This is one reason for the intemperate response from some traditional economists to the Stern Review Eric Neumayer 2007 of the London School of Economics thought that the Review could have argued for emission reductions based on the nonsubstitutable loss of natural capital Neumayer argued that the real issue is the nonsubstitutable loss of natural capital that is to what extent climate change inflicts irreversible and nonsubstitutable damage to and loss of natural capital Economists define natural capital as the multiple and various services of nature from which humans benefit from natural resources to pollution absorption and environmental amenities Dieter Helm 2008 of Oxford University was critical of the Reviews analysis but accepted its conclusion of the urgent need to reduce emissions Helm justified this on the grounds that future damages to the environment would probably not be fully compensated for by increases in manmade capital The draft report of the Garnaut Climate Change Review a similar study conducted in Australia in 2008 by Ross Garnaut broadly endorsed the approach undertaken by Stern but concluded in the light of new information that Stern had underestimated the severity of the problem and the extent of the cuts in emissions that were required to avoid dangerous climate change The Yale Symposium In 2007 a symposium was held at Yale University on the Stern Review with talks by several economists including Nordhaus and Stern Yale Symposium 2007 Stern presented the basic conclusions of the Review and commented on some of the criticisms of it made by other speakers Chris Hope of Cambridge University explained how the damage estimates in the Review were calculated Hope designed the PAGE2002 integrated assessment model that was used in the Review Hope explained what would happen to the Stern Reviews damage estimates if they were made using different assumptions for example a higher discount rate Hope also pointed to the assumptions used in the model to do with adaptation In his talk Nordhaus criticised the fact that the Stern Review had not been subject to a peerreview and repeated earlier criticisms of the Reviews discount rate William Cline of the Peterson Institute supported the Reviews general conclusions but was uncomfortable about how most greater than 90 of the Reviews monetised damages of climate change occur after 2200 Cline noted that the Reviews large costbenefit ratio for mitigation policy allows room for these longterm costs to be reduced substantially but still support aggressive action to reduce emissions Robert Mendelsohn was critical of the way the Stern justified his suggested mitigation policy in the Review Mendelsohn said that rather than finding an optimal policy the Review presented a choice of policy versus nopolicy Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University questioned some of the assumptions used in Nordhauss integrated assessment model DICE of climate change Sachs was supportive of Sterns cost estimates of climate change mitigation In response to these talks Stern accepted Clines comment about the weighting of future damages and said that the weighting of these damages could be reduced by the increasing the size of the elasticity of marginal utility in the social discount rate With regards to criticisms of the discount rate Stern accepted that differences of opinion could exist on his ethical choice for the PTPrate Yale Symposium 2007 p 118 Other comments by Stern included what he viewed as confusion over what he had suggested as a possible level for a carbon tax According to Stern the tax will not necessarily be the same as the social cost of carbon due to distortions and uncertainties in the economy p 121 His suggested tax rate was in the range of 25 to 30 dollars per ton of carbon Stern did not accept Mendelsohns argument that the Review presented a choice of policy versus no policy Stern commented that the arguments for his recommended stabilisation range were included in Chapter 13 of the Review pp 124–125 The costs of mitigation Economists have different views over the cost estimates of climate change mitigation given in the Review Paul Ekins of Kings College London Treasury Committee 2008 has said that Sterns central mitigation cost estimate is reasonable but economists Robert Mendelsohn and Dieter Helm have commented that the estimate is probably too low According to Mendelsohn the Stern Review is far too optimistic about mitigation costs stating that one of the depressing things about the greenhouse gas problem is that the cost of eliminating it is quite high We will actually have to sacrifice a great deal to cut emissions dramatically Mendelsohn 2007 Professor Emeritus of Economics at Pepperdine University George Reisman has said that Any serious consideration of the proposals made in the Stern Review for radically reducing carbon technology and the accompanying calls for immediacy in enacting them makes clear in a further way how utterly impractical the environmentalist program for controlling global warming actually is The fundamental impracticality of the program of course lies in its utterly destructive character In a response to a paper by members of the Stern Review team John Weyant of Stanford University commented on how the cost estimate of mitigation used in the Review was based on idealised models Mendelsohn et al 2008 Weyant wrote that his own high shortrun cost projection for stabilisation of possibly 10 GDP resulted primarily from institutional pessimism rather than technological pessimism Comparison with climate damages Nobel prize winner Kenneth Arrow has commented on the Stern Review in the Economists Voice Arrow 2007a and for Project Syndicate Arrow 2007b Critics of the Stern Review dont think serious action to limit CO2 emissions is justified because there remains substantial uncertainty about the extent of the costs of global climate change and because these costs will be incurred far in the future However I believe that Sterns fundamental conclusion is justified we are much better off reducing CO2 emissions substantially than risking the consequences of failing to act even if unlike Stern one heavily discounts uncertainty and the future Arrow analysed the Stern Reviews conclusions by looking at the Reviews central estimate of GHG stabilisation costs of 1 GNP and highend climate damages of 20 GNP Arrow 2007a pp 4–5 As part of the Ramsay formula for the social discount rate Arrow chose a value of 2 for the marginal elasticity of utility while in the Review Stern chose a value of 1 According to Arrow Sterns recommended stabilisation target passes a costbenefit test even when considerably higher PTPrate up to around 8 than Sterns 01 is used Arrow acknowledged that his argument depended on Sterns stabilisation central cost estimate being correct Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University noted that Sterns estimates of businessasusual climate damages were given in terms of per capita consumption equivalents but Sterns costs of mitigation were given in terms of a percentage reduction in gross world product Yohe stated that the two different measures are not really at all comparable Yohe commented on how the Review gives the impression that all climate damages can be avoided through the investment of 1 of world GDP in mitigation This however would still lead to global warming as per the Reviews 550 ppm CO2e mitigation target of around 15 to 45 °C above preindustrial temperatures Significant portions of climate damages would therefore still persist with Sterns mitigation target To measure the benefit of Sterns mitigation target the residual climate damages from mitigation would need to be subtracted from Sterns businessasusual climate damages Ecological Economic Critique The main criticisms cited above concern the details of calculations and modelling choices within an orthodox economic framing of the world and mostly try to argue against substantive greenhouse gas mitigation Ecological economists accept the need for serious action but reject the reasoning of economic commensuration of costs and benefits the probabilistic approach to uncertainty and the application of a utilitarian intergenerational calculus Their criticism applies equally to the likes of Nordhaus and Tol The orthodox economic debate is seen as a distraction from the basic ethical issues eg discounting instead of justice A more fundamental criticism of the Stern report is that it raises a series of problems which it totally fails to address because of its orthodox approach It simultaneously ignores a range of critical literature from ecological economics and environmental ethics which challenges such orthodox thinking Stern as an orthodox economist squeezes all matters and concepts into a narrow mathematical formalism which heterodox economists such as Tony Lawson point out fails to address economic and social reality In conventional costbenefit analysis biodiversity and ecosystem services that are not valued as losses are difficult to quantify Neumayer argues that the real issue is nonsubstitutable loss of natural capital to what extent climate change inflicts irreversible and nonsubstitutable damage to and loss of natural capital For example it would be difficult to quantify the loss of coral reefs biodiversity loss or species extinction Dietz points out that in many Integrated Assessment Models IAMs health and ecosystem impacts are not included because the monetary valuation of these impacts is “speculative and uncertain” Dasgupta 2008 also points out most model do not consider natural capital Although recent studies on ecosystem services have made gains in monetising the value of ecosystems more recent studies on ecosystem services suggest the Stern Review underestimates the need for mitigation action as it is difficult for models to quantify the collapse of ecosystem services under climate change Thus ecological economist Clive Spash has questioned whether the report is nothing more than an exercise in rhetoric Spash notes that a range of serious problems challenging economic analysis is raised or mentioned in the report including strong uncertainty incommensurability plural values nonutilitarian ethics rights distributional inequity poverty and treatment of future generations How then can this report acknowledging so many of those aspects of climate change that render orthodox economic analysis unsuitable for generating policy recommendations go ahead to conduct a global costbenefit calculation based on microeconomic theory and make that the foundation for its policy recommendations Spash has argued that issues are suppressed and sidelined in a careful and methodical manner with the pretense they have been addressed by ‘state of the art’ solutions Meanwhile the authors maintain allegiance to an economic orthodoxy which perpetuates the dominant political myth that traditional economic growth can be both sustained and answer all our problems Besides perpetuating myths this diverts attention away from alternative approaches away from ethical debates over harming the innocent the poor and future generations and away from the fundamental changes needed to tackle the very real and serious problems current economic systems pose for environmental systems In addition the policy recommendation of carbon trading is seen as deeply flawed for also failing to take account of social ecological and economic reality Response to criticisms The Stern Review team have responded to criticisms of the Review in a number of papers In these papers they reassert their view that early and strong action on climate change is necessary The case for strong and urgent action set out in the Review is based first on the severe risks that the science now identifies together with the additional uncertainties that it points to but that are difficult to quantify and second on the ethics of the responsibilities of existing generations in relation to succeeding generations It is these two things that are crucial risk and ethics Different commentators may vary in their emphasis but it is the two together that are crucial Jettison either one and you will have a much reduced programme for action—and if you judge risks to be small and attach little significance to future generations you will not regard global warming as a problem It is surprising that the earlier economic literature on climate change did not give risk and ethics the attention they so clearly deserve and it is because we chose to make them central and explicit that we think we were right for the right reasons Members of the Stern Review team have also given several talks that have covered criticisms of the Review A talk given by Dimitri Zenghelis at the Tyndall Centre looked at criticisms of the Review and presented an overview of its main findings In an official letter 2008 Joan Ruddock MP of the UK Government dismisses the criticisms of the Review made by several economists which in her view show a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of formal highly aggregated economic modelling in evaluating a policy issue Sterns later comments In April 2008 Stern said that the severity of his findings were vindicated by the 2007 IPCC report and admitted that in the Stern Review We underestimated the risks we underestimated the damage associated with temperature increases and we underestimated the probabilities of temperature increases In June 2008 Stern said that because climate change is happening faster than predicted the cost to reduce carbon would be even higher of about 2 of GDP instead of the 1 in the original report In an interview at the 2013 World Economic Forum Stern said Looking back I underestimated the risks The planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less carbon than we expected and emissions are rising pretty strongly Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought then in the 2006 Review He now believes we are on track for something like four degrees See also Climate change in the United Kingdom
