 A phase change material PCM is a substance with a high heat of fusion which melting and solidifying at a certain temperature is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa thus PCMs are classified as latent heat storage LHS units Characteristics and classification Latent heat storage can be achieved through liquid–solid solid–liquid solid–gas and liquid–gas phase changes However only solid–liquid and liquid–solid phase changes are practical for PCMs Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions liquidgas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation Initially solid–liquid PCMs behave like sensible heat storage SHS materials their temperature rises as they absorb heat Unlike conventional SHS materials however when PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase their melting temperature they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls the PCM solidifies releasing its stored latent heat A large number of PCMs are available in any required temperature range from −5 up to 190 °C Within the human comfort range between 20–30 °C some PCMs are very effective They store 5 to 14 times more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water masonry or rock Organic PCMs Paraffin CnH2n2 carbohydrate and lipid derived Advantages Freeze without much undercooling Ability to melt congruently Self nucleating properties Compatibility with conventional material of construction No segregation Chemically stable High heat of fusion Safe and nonreactive Recyclable Carbohydrate and lipid based PCMs can be produced from renewable sources Disadvantages Low thermal conductivity in their solid state High heat transfer rates are required during the freezing cycle Volumetric latent heat storage capacity can be low Flammable This can be partially alleviated by specialist containment To obtain reliable phase change points most manufacturers use technical grade paraffins which are essentially paraffin mixtures and are completely refined of oil resulting in high costs Inorganic Salt hydrates MnH2O Advantages High volumetric latent heat storage capacity Availability and low cost Sharp melting point High thermal conductivity High heat of fusion Nonflammable Disadvantages Change of volume is very high Super cooling is major problem in solid–liquid transition Nucleating agents are needed and they often become inoperative after repeated cycling Eutectics cinorganic inorganicinorganic compounds Advantages Eutectics have sharp melting point similar to pure substance Volumetric storage density is slightly above organic compounds Extra water principle can be used to avoid phase change degradation involving dissolving the anhydrous salt during melting to result in a thickening of the liquid material so that it melts to a gel form Disadvantages Only limited data is available on thermophysical properties as the use of these materials are relatively new to thermal storage application Hygroscopic materials Many natural building materials are hygroscopic that is they can absorb water condenses and release water water evaporates The process is thus Condensation gas to liquid ΔH0 enthalpy decreases exothermic process gives off heat Vaporization liquid to gas ΔH0 enthalpy increases endothermic process absorbs heat or cools Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy large surfaces area allows significant 1–2 °C heating or cooling in buildings The corresponding materials are wool insulation earthclay render finishes Selection criteria Thermodynamic properties The phase change material should possess Melting temperature in the desired operating temperature range High latent heat of fusion per unit volume High specific heat high density and high thermal conductivity Small volume changes on phase transformation and small vapor pressure at operating temperatures to reduce the containment problem Congruent melting Kinetic properties High nucleation rate to avoid supercooling of the liquid phase High rate of crystal growth so that the system can meet demands of heat recovery from the storage system Chemical properties Chemical stability Complete reversible freezemelt cycle No degradation after a large number of freezemelt cycle Noncorrosiveness nontoxic nonflammable and nonexplosive materials Economic properties Low cost Availability Thermophysical properties Common PCMs Volumetric

Engineering Technology development and encapsulation The most commonly used PCMs are salt hydrates fatty acids and esters and various paraffins such as octadecane Recently also ionic liquids were investigated as novel PCMs As most of the organic solutions are waterfree they can be exposed to air but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications They have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for the thermal storage applications They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation for rail and road applications and their physical properties are therefore well known Unlike the ice storage system however the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water chiller both for a new or alternatively retrofit application The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a cooling tower or dry cooler for charging the TES system The temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications The scope of this thermal energy application is wide ranging of solar heating hot water heating rejection ie cooling tower and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications Since PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling encapsulation naturally become the obvious storage choice Encapsulation of PCMs Macroencapsulation Early development of macroencapsulation with large volume containment failed due to the poor thermal conductivity of most PCMs PCMs tend to solidify at the edges of the containers preventing effective heat transfer Microencapsulation Microencapsulation on the other hand showed no such problem It allows the PCMs to be incorporated into construction materials such as concrete easily and economically Microencapsulated PCMs also provide a portable heat storage system By coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating the particles can be suspended within a continuous phase such as water This system can be considered a phase change slurry PCS Molecularencapsulation is another technology developed by Dupont de Nemours that allows a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound It allows storage capacity up to 515 kJm for a 5 mm board 103 MJm Molecularencapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage As phase change materials perform best in small containers therefore they are usually divided in cells The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry The packaging material should conduct heat well and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage materials volume as phase changes occur It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls so the materials will not dry out or waterout if the material is hygroscopic Packaging must also resist leakage and corrosion Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include stainless steel polypropylene and polyolefin Thermal composites Thermalcomposites is a term given to combinations of phase change materials PCMs and other usually solid structures A simple example is a coppermesh immersed in a paraffinwax The coppermesh within parraffinwax can be considered a composite material dubbed a thermalcomposite Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties Thermal conductivity is a common property which is targeted for maximisation by creating thermal composites In this case the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid such as the coppermesh into the relatively low conducting PCM thus increasing overall or bulk thermal conductivity If the PCM is required to flow the solid must be porous such as a mesh Solid composites such as fibreglass or kevlarprepreg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fibre the kevlar or the glass and a matrix the glue which solidifies to hold fibres and provide compressive strength A thermal composite is not so clearly defined but could similarly refer to a matrix solid and the PCM which is of course usually liquid andor solid depending on conditions They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth Applications Applications of phase change materials include but are not limited to

cooling Turbine Inlet Chilling with thermal energy storage Telecom shelters in tropical regions They protect the highvalue equipment in the shelter by keeping the indoor air temperature below the maximum permissible by absorbing heat generated by powerhungry equipment such as a Base Station Subsystem In case of a power failure to conventional cooling systems PCMs minimize use of diesel generators and this can translate into enormous savings across thousands of telecom sites in tropics Fire and safety issues Some phase change materials are suspended in water and are relatively nontoxic Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials or are toxic As such PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices Because of the increased fire risk flamespread smoke potential for explosion when held in containers and liability it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics See also Heat pipe References Further reading Raoux S 2009 Phase Change Materials Annual
