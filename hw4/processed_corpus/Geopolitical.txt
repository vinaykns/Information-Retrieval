 Geopolitics from Greek γῆ ge earth land and πολιτική politikē politics is the study of the effects of geography human and physical on international politics and international relations Geopolitics is a method of studying foreign policy to understand explain and predict international political behavior through geographical variables These include area studies climate topography demography natural resources and applied science of the region being evaluated Geopolitics focuses on political power in relation to geographic space In particular territorial waters and land territory in correlation with diplomatic history Academically geopolitics analyses history and social science with reference to geography in relation to politics Outside of academia a variety of groups offer a geopolitical prognosis including nonprofit groups and forprofit private institutions such as brokerage houses and consulting companiesTopics of geopolitics include relations between the interests of international political actors interests focused to an area space geographical element or ways relations which create a geopolitical system Critical geopolitics deconstructs classical geopolitical theories by showing their politicalideological functions for great powers during and after the age of imperialism The term has been used to describe a broad spectrum of ideas from a synonym for international relations social political and historical phenomena to various pseudoscientific theories of historical and geographic determinism United States Alfred Thayer Mahan and sea power Alfred Thayer Mahan 1840–1914 a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war Mahans theoretical framework came from AntoineHenri Jomini and emphasized that strategic locations such as chokepoints canals and coaling stations as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet were conducive to control over the sea He proposed six conditions required for a nation to have sea power Advantageous geographical position Serviceable coastlines abundant natural resources and favorable climate Extent of territory Population large enough to defend its territory Society with an aptitude for the sea and commercial enterprise and Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea Mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the Eurasian context namely the Central Zone of Asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from Asia Minor to Japan In this zone independent countries still survived – Turkey Persia Afghanistan China and Japan Mahan regarded those countries located between Britain and Russia as if between Scylla and Charybdis Of the two monsters – Britain and Russia – it was the later that Mahan considered more threatening to the fate of Central Asia Mahan was impressed by Russias transcontinental size and strategically favorable position for southward expansion Therefore he found it necessary for the AngloSaxon sea power to resist Russia Emil Reich The AustroHungarian historian Emil Reich 1854–1910 is considered to be the first having coined the acceptance in English as early as 1902 and later in 1904 in his book Foundations of Modern Europe Homer Lea Homer Lea in The Day of the Saxon 1912 described that the entire AngloSaxon race faced a threat from German Teuton Russian Slav and Japanese expansionism The fatal relationship of Russia Japan and Germany has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of Saxon supremacy It is a dreadful Dreibund Lea believed that while Japan moved against Far East and Russia against India the Germans would strike at England the center of the British Empire He thought the AngloSaxons faced certain disaster from their militant opponents Mackinder and the Heartland theory Sir Halford Mackinders Heartland Theory initially received little attention outside geography but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policies of world powers Those scholars who look to MacKinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for Britain with his Eurocentric analysis of historical geography His formulation of the Heartland Theory was set out in his article entitled The Geographical Pivot of History published in England in 1904 Mackinders doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of navies he coined the term sea power in world conflict He saw navy as a basis of Colombian era empire roughly from 1492 to the 19th century and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power The Heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland—which wouldnt need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent The basic notions of Mackinders doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being divided into two sections the World Island or Core comprising Eurasia and Africa and the Peripheral islands including the Americas Australia Japan the British Isles and Oceania Not only was the Periphery noticeably smaller than the World Island it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the World Island—which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy Mackinder posited that the industrial centers of the Periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations The World Island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the Periphery so they would have a longer struggle reaching them and would face a wellstocked industrial bastion Mackinder called this region the Heartland It essentially comprised Central and Eastern Europe Ukraine Western Russia and Mitteleuropa The Heartland contained the grain reserves of Ukraine and many other natural resources Mackinders notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said Who rules Central and Eastern Europe commands the Heartland Who rules the Heartland commands the WorldIsland Who rules the WorldIsland commands the World Nicholas J Spykman is both a follower and critic of geostrategists Alfred Mahan and Halford Mackinder His work is based on assumptions similar to Mackinders including the unity of world politics and the world sea He extends this to include the unity of the air Spykman adopts Mackinders divisions of the world renaming some The Heartland The Rimland analogous to Mackinders inner or marginal crescent also an intermediate region lying between the Heartland and the marginal sea powers and The Offshore Islands Continents Mackinders outer or insular crescent Under Spykmans theory a Rimland separates the Heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year that is not frozen up during winter Spykman suggested this required that attempts by Heartland nations particularly Russia to conquer ports in the Rimland must be prevented Spykman modified Mackinders formula on the relationship between the Heartand and the Rimland or the inner crescent claiming that Who controls the rimland rules Eurasia Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world This theory can be traced in the origins of Containment a US policy on preventing the spread of Soviet influence after World War II see also Truman Doctrine Another famous follower of Mackinder was Karl Haushofer who called Mackinders Geographical Pivot of History a genius scientific tractate He commented on it Never have I seen anything greater than those few pages of geopolitical masterwork Mackinder located his Pivot in the words of Haushofer on one of the first solid geopolitically and geographically irreproachable maps presented to one of the earliest scientific forums of the planet – the Royal Geographic Society in London Haushofer adopted both Mackinders Heartland thesis and his view of the RussianGerman alliance – powers that Mackinder saw as the major contenders for control of Eurasia in the twentieth century Following Mackinder he suggested an alliance with the Soviet Union and advancing a step beyond Mackinder added Japan to his design of the Eurasian Bloc In 2004 at the centenary of The Geographical Pivot of History famous Historian Paul Kennedy wrote Right now with hundreds of thousands of US troops in the Eurasian rimlands and with administration constantly explaining why it has to stay the course it looks as if Washington is taking seriously Mackinders injunction to ensure control of the geographical pivot of history Kissinger Brzezinski and the Grand Chessboard Two famous Security Advisers from the Cold War period Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski cared lest the United States lose its geopolitical focus on Eurasia and first and foremost on Russia despite the fall of Communism and the end of the ideological struggle Ideological Cold warriors both turned into convinced geopoliticians after the end of the Cold War and each wrote an influential book on the subject in the 1990s—Diplomacy Kissinger 1994 and The Grand Chessboard American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives The AngloAmerican classical geopolitical theories were revived Students of geopolitics and history Kissinger wrote in Diplomacy are uneasy about the approach that hostile intentions have disappeared and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer apply They would argue … that Russia regardless of who govern it sits astride the territory Halford Mackinder called the geopolitical heartland and is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions The United States must maintain the global balance of power visàvis the country with a long history of expansionism After Russia the second geopolitical threat traditionally remained Germany and as Mackinder had feared ninety years ago its partnership with Russia During the Cold War Kissinger argues both sides of the Atlantic recognized that unless America is organically involved in Europe it would be obliged to involve itself later under circumstances far less favorable to both sides of the Atlantic That is even more true today Germany has become so strong that existing European institutions cannot by themselves strike a balance between Germany and its European partners Nor can Europe even with Germany manage by itself … Russia… It is in no countrys interest that Germany and Russia should fixate on each other as principal partner They would raise fears of condominium Without America Britain and France cannot cope with Germany and Russia and without Europe America could turn … into an island off the shores of Eurasia Spykmans vision of Eurasia was strongly confirmed Geopolitically America is an island off the shores of the large landmass of Euraisa whose resources and population far exceed those of the United States The domination by a single power of either of Eurasias two principal spheres—Europe and Asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for America Cold War or no Cold War For such a grouping would have the capacity to outstrip America economically and in the end militarily That danger would have to be resisted even were the dominant power apparently benevolent for if the intentions ever changed America would find itself with a grossly diminished capacity for effective resistance and a growing inability to shape events The main interest of the American leaders is maintaining the balance of power in Eurasia Having converted from ideologist into geopolitician Kissinger in retrospect interpreted the Cold War in geopolitical terms—an approach not characteristic for his works during the Cold War Now however he stressed on the beginning of the Cold War The objective of moral opposition to Communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing the Soviet expansion Nixon he added was geopolitical rather than ideological cold warrior Three years after Kissingers Dilpomacy Brzezinski followed suit launching The Grand Chessboard American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives and after three more years The Geostrategic Triad Living with China Europe and Russia The Grand Chessboard described the American triumph in the Cold War in terms of control over Eurasia for the first time ever a nonEurasian power had emerged as a key arbiter of Eurasian power relations The book states its purpose The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book Although the power configuration underwent a revolutionary change Brzezinski confirmed three years later Eurasia was still a megacontinent Like Spykman Brzezinski acknowledges that Cumulatively Eurasias power vastly overshadows Americas In classical Spykman terms Brzezinski formulized his geostrategic chessboard doctrine of Eurasia which aims to prevent the unification of this megacontinent Europe and Asia are politically and economically powerful… It follows that… American foreign policy must…employ its influence in Eurasia in a manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium with the United States as the political arbiter… Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global primacy continues to be played and that struggle involves geo strategy – the strategic management of geopolitical interests… But in the meantime it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America… For America the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia…and Americas global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sustained Germany German Geopolitik is characterized by the belief that life of States—being similar to those of human beings and animals—is shaped by scientific determinism and social Darwinism German geopolitics develops the concept of Lebensraum living space that is thought to be necessary to the development of a nation like a favorable natural environment would be for animals Friedrich Ratzel Friedrich Ratzel 1844–1904 influenced by thinkers such as Darwin and zoologist Ernst Heinrich Haeckel contributed to Geopolitik by the expansion on the biological conception of geography without a static conception of borders Positing that states are organic and growing with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement he held that the expanse of a states borders is a reflection of the health of the nation—meaning that static countries are in decline Ratzel published several papers among which was the essay Lebensraum 1901 concerning biogeography Ratzel created a foundation for the German variant of geopolitics geopolitik Influenced by the American geostrategist Alfred Thayer Mahan Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach agreeing that sea power was selfsustaining as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine unlike land power The geopolitical theory of Ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic Critically he also underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of power The association of German Geopolitik with Nazism After World War I the thoughts of Rudolf Kjellén and Ratzel were picked up and extended by a number of German authors such as Karl Haushofer 1869–1946 Erich Obst Hermann Lautensach and Otto Maull In 1923 Karl Haushofer founded the Zeitschrift für Geopolitik Journal for Geopolitics which was later used in the propaganda of Nazi Germany The key concepts of Haushofers Geopolitik were Lebensraum autarky panregions and organic borders States have Haushofer argued an undeniable right to seek natural borders which would guarantee autarky Haushofers influence within the Nazi Party has recently been challenged given that Haushofer failed to incorporate the Nazis racial ideology into his work Popular views of the role of geopolitics in the Nazi Third Reich suggest a fundamental significance on the part of the geopoliticians in the ideological orientation of the Nazi state Bassin 1987 reveals that these popular views are in important ways misleading and incorrect Despite the numerous similarities and affinities between the two doctrines geopolitics was always held suspect by the National Socialist ideologists This was understandable for the underlying philosophical orientation of geopolitics did not comply with that of National Socialism Geopolitics shared Ratzels scientific materialism and geographic determinism and held that human society was determined by external influences—in the face of which qualities held innately by individuals or groups were of reduced or no significance National Socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities in the form of a hypothesized racial character to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society These differences led after 1933 to friction and ultimately to open denunciation of geopolitics by Nazi ideologues Nevertheless German Geopolitik was discredited by its misuse in Nazi expansionist policy of World War II and has never achieved standing comparable to the prewar period The resultant negative association particularly in US academic circles between classical geopolitics and Nazi or imperialist ideology is based on loose justifications This has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography and proponents of a neoclassical geopolitics in particular These include Haverluk et al who argue that the stigmatization of geopolitics in academia is unhelpful as geopolitics as a field of positivist inquiry maintains potential in researching and resolving topical often politicized issues such as conflict resolution and prevention and mitigating climate change Disciplinary differences in perspectives Negative associations with the term geopolitics and its practical application stemming from its association with World War II and preWorld War II German scholars and students of Geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic Geography and subdisciplines of Human Geography such as Political Geography in particular However this negative association does not exist or at least not to the same extent in disciplines such as History or Political Science that make use of geopolitical concepts Classical Geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for Military History as well as for subdisciplines of Political Science such as International Relations and Security Studies This difference in disciplinary perspectives is addressed by Bert Chapman in Geopolitics A Guide To the Issues in which Chapman makes note that academic and professional International Relations journals are more amenable to the study and analysis of Geopolitics and in particular Classical Geopolitics than contemporary academic journals in the field of Political Geography In disciplines outside of Geography Geopolitics is not negatively viewed as it often is among academic geographers such as Carolyn Gallaher or Klaus Dodds as a tool of Imperialism or associated with Nazism but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations France French geopolitical doctrines lie broadly in opposition to German Geopolitik and reject the idea of a fixed geography French geography is focused on the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankinds actions It also relies on the consideration of long time periods through a refusal to take specific events into account This method has been theorized by Professor Lacoste according to three principles Representation Diachronie and Diatopie In The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu outlined the view that man and societies are influenced by climate He believed that hotter climates create hottempered people and colder climates aloof people whereas the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems Considered as one of the founders of French geopolitics Élisée Reclus is the author of a book considered as a reference in modern geography Nouvelle Géographie universelle Alike Ratzel he considers geography through a global vision However in complete opposition to Ratzels vision Reclus considers geography not to be unchanging it is supposed to evolve commensurately to the development of human society His marginal political views resulted in his rejection by academia French geographer and geopolitician Jacques Ancel is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in France and gave a notable series of lectures at the Carnegie foundation and published Géopolitique in 1936 Like Reclus Ancel rejects German determinist views on geopolitics including Haushofers doctrines Braudels broad view used insights from other social sciences employed the concept of the longue durée and downplayed the importance of specific events This method was inspired by the French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache who in turn was influenced by German thought particularly that of Friedrich Ratzel whom he had met in Germany Braudels method was to analyse the interdependence between individuals and their environment Vidalian geopolitics is based on varied forms of cartography and on possibilism founded on a societal approach of geography—ie on the principle of spaces polymorphic faces depending from many factors among them mankind culture and ideas as opposed to determinism Due to the influence of German Geopolitik on French geopolitics the latter were for a long time banished from academic works In the mid1970s Yves Lacoste—a French geographer who was directly inspired by Ancel Braudel and Vidal de la Blache—wrote La géographie ça sert dabord à faire la guerre Geography first use is warin 1976 This book—which is very famous in France—symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics if not so far the first French school of geopolitics as Ancel was very isolated in the 1930s–40s Initially linked with communist party evolved to a less liberal approach At the end of the 1980s he founded the Institut Français de Géopolitique French Institute for Geopolitics that publishes the Hérodote revue While rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the German and AngloAmerican traditions and the new geographers this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis This approach emphazises the importance of multilevel or multiscales analysis and maps at the opposite of critical geopolitics which avoid such tools Lacoste proposed that every conflict both local or global can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions Representation Each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals Thus basic societal beliefs are grounded in their ethnicity or specific location The study of representation is a common point with the more contemporary critical geopolitics Both are connected with the work of Henri Lefebvre La production de lespace first published in 1974 Diachronie Conducting an historical analysis confronting long periods and short periods as the prominent French historian Fernand Braudel suggested Diatopie Conducting a cartographic survey through a multiscale mapping Connected with this stream and former member of Hérodote editorial board the French geographer Michel Foucher developed a long term analysis of international borders He coined various neologism among them Horogenesis Neologism that describes the concept of studying the birth of borders Dyade border shared by two neighbouring states for instance US territory has two terrestrial dyades  one with Canada and one with Mexico The main book of this searcher Fronts et frontières Fronts and borders first published in 1991 without equivalent remains as of yet untranslated in English Michel Foucher is an expert of the African Union for borders affairs More or less connected with this school Stéphane Rosière can be quoted as the editor in Chief of the online journal LEspace politique this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent French journal of political geography and Geopolitics with Hérodote A much more conservative stream is personified by François Thual Thual was a French expert in geopolitics and a former official of the Ministry of Civil Defence Thual taught geopolitics of the religions at the French War College and has written thirty books devoted mainly to geopolitical method and its application to various parts of the world He is particularly interested in the Orthodox Shiite and Buddhist religions and in troubled regions like the Caucasus Connected with F Thual Aymeric Chauprade former professor of geopolitics at the French War College and now member of the extremeright party Front national subscribes to a supposed new French school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to realpolitik and clash of civilization Huntington The thought of this school is expressed through the French Review of Geopolitics headed by Chauprade and the International Academy of Geopolitics Chauprade is a supporter of a Europe of nations he advocates a European Union excluding Turkey and a policy of compromise with Russia in the frame of a Eurasian alliance which is en vogue among European extremeright politists and supports the idea of a multipolar world—including a balanced relationship between China and the US Russia In the 1990s a senior researcher at the Institute of Philosophy Russian Academy of Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vadim Tsymbursky   ru 19572009 coined the term islandRussia and developed the Great Limitrophe concept ColonelGeneral Leonid Ivashov retired a Russian geopolitics specialist of the early 21st century headed the Academy of Geopolitical Problems Russian Академия геополитических проблем which analyses the international and domestic situations and develops geopolitical doctrine Earlier ColonelGeneral Leonid Ivashov headed the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation Vladimir Karyakin Leading Researcher at the Russian Institute of Strategic Studies ru has proposed the term geopolitics of the third wave Metageopolitics The framework of Metageopolitics proposed by Nayef AlRodhan combines traditional and new dimensions of geopolitics to offer a multidimensional view of power and power relationships In this framework the importance of geography is superseded by the combination of hard and soft power tools that states can employ to preserve and obtain power Metageopolitics defines seven key dimensions of state power that include social and health issues domestic politics economics environment science and human potential military and security issues and international diplomacy The Metageopolitics framework allows for the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses as well as predictions about future trends Furthermore while this analytical grid is relevant for states it also applies to private and transnational entities which are playing an increasingly important role in contemporary geopolitics Noninterventionism Noninterventionism the geopolitical policy whereby a nation seeks to avoid alliances with other nations in order to avoid being drawn into wars not related to direct territorial selfdefense An original more formal definition is that Nonintervention is a policy characterized by the absence of interference by a state or states in the external affairs of another state without its consent or in its internal affairs with or without its consent This is based on the grounds that a state should not interfere in the internal politics of another state based upon the principles of state sovereignty and selfdetermination A similar phrase is strategic independence Historical examples of supporters of noninterventionism are US Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson who both favored nonintervention in European Wars while maintaining free trade Other proponents include United States Senator Robert A Taft and United States Congressman Ron Paul See also
