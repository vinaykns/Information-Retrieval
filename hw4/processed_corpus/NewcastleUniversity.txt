1851 following a dispute among the teaching staff the School split into two rival institutions The majority formed the Newcastle College of Medicine and the others established themselves as the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Practical Science By 1852 the majority college was formally linked to the University of Durham It awarded its first Licence in Medicine LicMed in 1856 and its teaching certificates were recognised by the University of London for graduation in medicine The two colleges amalgamated in 1857 and renamed the University of Durham College of Medicine in 1870 Attempts to realise a place for the teaching of sciences in the city were finally met with the foundation of the College of Physical Science in 1871 The college offered instruction in mathematics physics chemistry and geology to meet the growing needs of the mining industry becoming the Durham College of Physical Science in 1883 and then renamed after William George Armstrong as Armstrong College in 1904 Both these separate and independent institutions later became part of the University of Durham whose 1908 Act formally recognised that the university consisted of two Divisions Durham and Newcastle on two different sites By 1908 the Newcastle Division was teaching a full range of subjects in the Faculties of Medicine Arts and Science which also included agriculture and engineering Throughout the early 20th century the medical and science colleges vastly outpaced the growth of their Durham counterparts and a Royal Commission in 1934 recommended the merger of the two colleges to form Kings College Durham Growth of the Newcastle Division of the federal Durham University led to tensions within the structure and on 1 August 1963 an Act of Parliament separated the two creating
