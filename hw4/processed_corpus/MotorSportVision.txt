Formula Palmer Audi championship from 1998 to 2010 which advanced the careers of hundreds of young drivers nine of whom have made it all the way to Formula One In 2008 MSV also acquired the rights to the British Superbike Championship In September 2008 MotorSport Vision won an FIA tender to supply cars and operate the FIA Formula Two Championship a new international single seater series derived from an FIA initiative to provide young drivers with the opportunity to compete in toplevel racing on a competitive budget The Formula Two cars like Formula Palmer Audi were assembled and prepared in a dedicated facility at Bedford Autodrome also home to PalmerSport and FPA This category was discontinued after 2010 One of its founders John Britten died on 25 November 2009 after a long period of illness Circuits Brands Hatch In 1986 John Foulston bought Brands Hatch Oulton Park and Snetterton circuits from Grovewood Securities and established the Brands Hatch Leisure BHL company The following year the company acquired Cadwell Park before Foulston died testing a McLaren CanAm car at Silverstone Ownership of BHL passed to his wife Mary but the company was run by John Webb until 1990 when daughter Nicola Foulston took over the running In that time Brands Hatch hosted higherprofile series such as Formula 3000 and Superbike World Championship racing 1988 saw further changes to the circuit layout with a chicane added at Dingle Dell Corner while Westfield Bend and Graham Hill Bend were tightened New pits and a corporate entertainment facility were added in the late1990s In 1999 Foulston announced that Brands Hatch had acquired the rights to the British Grand Prix from 2002 Whilst discussions were ongoing with regards to planning permission to bring the circuit up to F1 requirements Foulston sold BHL to Octagon Motorsports a subsidiary of Interpublic for £120 m Octagon however failed to obtain the necessary planning permission and instead decided to lease Silverstone in order to host the Grand Prix However highprofile singleseater racing did return to Brands Hatch in 2003 when a round of the CART series was held at the circuit Despite attracting around 40000 spectators the race was not retained for subsequent seasons With financial pressures stemming from running the British Grand Prix Octagon sold off the group of four circuits including Brands Hatch to the MotorSport Vision group headed by exF1 driver Jonathan Palmer in 2004 Oulton Park After many years of decay Oulton was given new life when it was bought by MotorSport Vision MSV redeveloped the circuit In 2007 Oulton park was voted the best UK circuit by British Superbike fans whilst a BTCC meeting on Sunday 27 July 2008 saw a crowd of 35000 attend a record not only for the circuit but the highest crowd at any venue of the BTCC for a decade Snetterton Snetterton has undergone perhaps the most radical transformation of all the MotorSport Vision circuits since being taken over in 2004 New spectator banking has been added to the track to improve circuit views whilst the restaurant and toilet facilities have been updated or replaced A new scrutineering bay has also been added Snetterton is regarded as being one of the fastest tracks in the UK thanks to its combination of several long straights and relatively few corners The lap record currently stands at 56095 seconds or an average speed of 12527 mph Cadwell Park In 1953 the track was lengthened to 13 miles 21 km upon the invitation of the 500 cc motorcycleengined Formula 3 to race in a traditional bike meeting Around 30000 spectators attended that particular race The original track grew to the current 225 miles 362 km layout in 1962 and hosted the British F3 series the next May Some of the bends are named after family members eg Mansfield Charlie and Chris Cadwell is now considered too narrow for high level car races although club motorsport associations such as the BARC and 750MC still hold meetings The layout is ideal for bikes however with the British Superbike Championship round being the most popular event on the championships calendar Several tests and feature clips for the motoring program Fifth Gear have been filmed here Bedford Autodrome The track in Thurleigh near Bedford is owned by MotorSport Vision No official motorsport events are held at the circuit but it is a popular public track day circuit it is also the home of the Jaguar SlikCat which is used for corporate events and for ride alongs during the track days It is served by Bedford Aerodrome Donington Park In January 2017 the Donington circuit business was taken over by MotorSport Vision with the Donington Park Estate on a 38 year lease until 2038 Laon MSV will build a circuit at the former LaonCouvron Air Base in France

Park Gold Cup There will also be numerous bike and car club meetings throughout the year including the Britcar Into The Night race at Brands Hatch British Superbikes In 2008 MotorSport Vision took over the responsibility for the organisation and promotion of the British Superbike Championship from Dorna The 2008 season was MSVs first in charge and saw Shane Byrne take the title The championship was screened live by British Eurosport and highlights were shown later on Channel 4 Formula Palmer Audi Formula Palmer Audi commonly known as FPA was founded in 1998 by Jonathan Palmer The ethos of FPA is to keep costs at a minimum whilst at all times promoting competitive and professional racing The series is known for producing exF1 driver and IndyCar racewinner Justin Wilson and helping the career of triple World Touring Car Champion Andy Priaulx In order to keep a level playing field as much as possible all the Formula Palmer Audi cars are run by a specialist team of FPA mechanics rather than having separate teams This concept of a large group of deliberately equalised cars has since been adopted by A1GP FPA announced a scholarship prize with the BRDC Stars of Tomorrow KF2 karting championship and with the newly revived FIA Formula Two Championship positioning the series as a fantastic intermediary step between karts and toplevel single seaters FPA folded after the 2010 season FIA Formula Two Championship The FIA Formula Two Championship was the revival of the Formula Two series that was highly successful from 1967 to 1985 It saw 24 drivers competing in identical MotorSport Visionrun cars with a 400 bhp Audi engine over 16 rounds The FIAs overall concern was that the cost of competing in motor racing at a level to progress directly to Formula One today is so high that it prevents many talented drivers from having the opportunity to participate In September 2008 the FIA tender to supply the cars and operate the FIA Formula Two Championship was awarded to MotorSport Vision Compared to rival series Formula Two will cost significantly less per season whilst allowing drivers to prove their skill and develop their racecraft in identical vehicles designed by a sixman team from WilliamsF1 led by Director of Engineering Patrick Head The series was marred by the tragic death of Henry Surtees who died in an accident during a race at Brands Hatch The series folded in 2012 MotorSport Vision Formula Three Cup F3 Cup is a national motor racing series that takes place primarily in the United Kingdom with a small number of events in mainland Europe It is a juniorlevel feeder formula that uses small single seater Formula Three built after 1980 and before 2007 The championship comprises nine rounds each with two races Each race weekend will comprise one

International There is one round held in Wales at Anglesey Circuit International and one round in Belgium at Spa Francorchamps A test drive of a Formula 2 was awarded to the most meritorious driver of the year which was Aaron Steele In 2012 F3 Cup has been awarded championship status so the F2 prize will be awarded to the driver of any class that has the most points There is also a team championship for MSA Entrants fielding two or more cars BRDC British Formula 4 Championship Originally operated by the 750 Motor Club a deal was reached in September 2012 to pass the name onto MotorSport Vision MSV to create the new BRDC Formula 4 Championship The championship featured a mix of professional motor racing teams and privately funded drivers using identical 20litre cars built by Ralph Firman’s RFR company The series was rebranded as the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship to reflect the pace of the new cars in use from the 2016 British Formula 3 Championship season and beyond BRDC British Formula 3 Championship The British Formula Three Championship officially named the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship is a national motor racing series that takes place in the
