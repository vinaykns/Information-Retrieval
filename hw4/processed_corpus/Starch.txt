 For the Urhobo cuisine dish known as starch see usi food Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods such as potatoes wheat maize corn rice and cassava Pure starch is a white tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol It consists of two types of molecules the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin Depending on the plant starch generally contains 20 to 25 amylose and 75 to 80 amylopectin by weight Glycogen the glucose store of animals is a more branched version of amylopectin In industry starch is converted into sugars for example by malting and fermented to produce ethanol in the manufacture of beer whisky and biofuel It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods Dissolving starch in warm water gives wheatpaste which can be used as a thickening stiffening or gluing agent The biggest industrial nonfood use of starch is as an adhesive in the papermaking process Starch can be applied to parts of some garments before ironing to stiffen them Etymology The word starch is from a Germanic root with the meanings strong stiff strengthen stiffen Modern German Stärke starch is related Amylum for starch is from the Greek αμυλον amylon which means not ground at a mill The root amyl is used in biochemistry for several compounds related to starch History Starch grains from the rhizomes of Typha cattails bullrushes as flour have been identified from grinding stones in Europe dating back to 30000 years ago Starch grains from sorghum were found on grind stones in caves in Ngalue Mozambique dating up to 100000 years ago Pure extracted wheat starch paste was used in Ancient Egypt possibly to glue papyrus The extraction of starch is first described in the Natural History of Pliny the Elder around AD 77–79 Romans used it also in cosmetic creams to powder the hair and to thicken sauces Persians and Indians used it to make dishes similar to gothumai wheat halva Rice starch as surface treatment of paper has been used in paper production in China from 700 AD onwards In addition to starchy plants consumed directly 66 million tonnes of starch were being produced per year worldwide by 2008 In the EU this was around 85 million tonnes with around 40 being used for industrial applications and 60 for food uses most of the latter as glucose syrups Energy store of plants Most green plants use starch as their energy store An exception is the family Asteraceae asters daisies and sunflowers where starch is replaced by the fructan inulin In photosynthesis plants use light energy to produce glucose from carbon dioxide The glucose is used to make cellulose fibers the structural component of the plant or is stored in the form of starch granules in amyloplasts Toward the end of the growing season starch accumulates in twigs of trees near the buds Fruit seeds rhizomes and tubers store starch to prepare for the next growing season Glucose is soluble in water hydrophilic binds with water and then takes up much space and is osmotically active glucose in the form of starch on the other hand is not soluble therefore osmotically inactive and can be stored much more compactly Glucose molecules are bound in starch by the easily hydrolyzed alpha bonds The same type of bond is found in the animal reserve polysaccharide glycogen This is in contrast to many structural polysaccharides such as chitin cellulose and peptidoglycan which are bound by beta bonds and are much more resistant to hydrolysis Biosynthesis Plants produce starch by first converting glucose 1phosphate to ADPglucose using the enzyme glucose1phosphate adenylyltransferase This step requires energy in the form of ATP The enzyme starch synthase then adds the ADPglucose via a 14alpha glycosidic bond to a growing chain of glucose residues liberating ADP and creating amylose Starch branching enzyme introduces 16alpha glycosidic bonds between these chains creating the branched amylopectin The starch debranching enzyme isoamylase removes some of these branches Several isoforms of these enzymes exist leading to a highly complex synthesis process Glycogen and amylopectin have similar structure but the former has about one branch point per ten 14alpha bonds compared to about one branch point per thirty 14alpha bonds in amylopectin Amylopectin is synthesized from ADPglucose while mammals and fungi synthesize glycogen from UDPglucose for most cases bacteria synthesize glycogen from ADPglucose analogous to starch In addition to starch synthesis in plants starch can be synthesized from nonfood starch mediated by an enzyme cocktail In this cellfree biosystem beta14glycosidic bondlinked cellulose is partially hydrolyzed to cellobiose Cellobiose phosphorylase cleaves to glucose 1phosphate and glucose the other enzyme—potato alphaglucan phosphorylase can add a glucose unit from glucose 1phosphorylase to the nonreducing ends of starch In it phosphate is internally recycled The other product glucose can be assimilated by a yeast This cellfree bioprocessing does not need any costly chemical and energy input can be conducted in aqueous solution and does not have sugar losses Degradation Starch is synthesized in plant leaves during the day in order to serve as an energy source at night Starch is stored as granules The insoluble highly branched starch chains have to be phosphorylated in order to be accessible for degrading enzymes The enzyme glucan water dikinase GWD phosphorylates at the C6 position of a glucose molecule close to the chains 16alpha branching bonds A second enzyme phosphoglucan water dikinase PWD phosphorylates the glucose molecule at the C3 position A loss of these enzymes for example a loss of the GWD leads to a starch excess sex phenotype and because starch cannot be phosphorylated it accumulates in the plastids After the phosphorylation the first degrading enzyme betaamylase BAM can attack the glucose chain at its nonreducing end Maltose is released as the main product of starch degradation If the glucose chain consists of three or fewer molecules BAM cannot release maltose A second enzyme disproportionating enzyme1 DPE1 combines two maltotriose molecules From this chain a glucose molecule is released Now BAM can release another maltose molecule from the remaining chain This cycle repeats until starch is degraded completely If BAM comes close to the phosphorylated branching point of the glucose chain it can no longer release maltose In order for the phosphorylated chain to be degraded the enzyme isoamylase ISA is required The products of starch degradation are predominantly maltose and smaller amounts of glucose These molecules are exported from the plastid to the cytosol maltose via the maltose transporter which if mutated MEX1mutant results in maltose accumulation in the plastid Glucose is exported via the plastidic glucose translocator pGlcT These two sugars act as a precursor for sucrose synthesis Sucrose can then be used in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the mitochondria to generate ATP at night Properties Structure While amylose was traditionally thought to be completely unbranched it is now known that some of its molecules contain a few branch points Although in absolute mass only about one quarter of the starch granules in plants consist of amylose there are about 150 times more amylose molecules than amylopectin molecules Amylose is a much smaller molecule than amylopectin Starch molecules arrange themselves in the plant in semicrystalline granules Each plant species has a unique starch granular size rice starch is relatively small about 2μm while potato starches have larger granules up to 100μm Starch becomes soluble in water when heated The granules swell and burst the semicrystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixtures viscosity This process is called starch gelatinization During cooking the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste the semicrystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens expelling water This is mainly caused by retrogradation of the amylose This process is responsible for the hardening of bread or staling and for the water layer on top of a starch gel syneresis Some cultivated plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose known as waxy starches The most used is waxy maize others are glutinous rice and waxy potato starch Waxy starches have less retrogradation resulting in a more stable paste High amylose starch amylomaize is cultivated for the use of its gel strength and for use as a resistant starch a starch that resists digestion in food products Synthetic amylose made from cellulose has a wellcontrolled degree of polymerization Therefore it can be used as a potential drug deliver carrier Certain starches when mixed with water will produce a nonnewtonian fluid sometimes nicknamed oobleck Hydrolysis The enzymes that break down or hydrolyze starch into the constituent sugars are known as amylases Alphaamylases are found in plants and in animals Human saliva is rich in amylase and the pancreas also secretes the enzyme Individuals from populations with a highstarch diet tend to have more amylase genes than those with lowstarch diets Betaamylase cuts starch into maltose units This process is important in the digestion of starch and is also used in brewing where amylase from the skin of seed grains is responsible for converting starch to maltose Malting Mashing Dextrinization If starch is subjected to dry heat it breaks down to form dextrins also called pyrodextrins in this context This break down process is known as dextrinization Pyrodextrins are mainly yellow to brown in color and dextrinization is partially responsible for the browning of toasted bread Chemical tests Main article Iodine test A triiodide I3 solution formed by mixing iodine and iodide usually from potassium iodide is used to test for starch a dark blue color indicates the presence of starch The details of this reaction are not yet fully known but it is thought that the iodine I3 and I5 ions fit inside the coils of amylose the charge transfers between the iodine and the starch and the energy level spacings in the resulting complex correspond to the absorption spectrum in the visible light region The strength of the resulting blue color depends on the amount of amylose present Waxy starches with little or no amylose present will color red Starch indicator solution consisting of water starch and iodide is often used in redox titrations in the presence of an oxidizing agent the solution turns blue in the presence of reducing agent the blue color disappears because triiodide I3 ions break up into three iodide ions disassembling the starchiodine complex A 03 ww solution is the standard concentration for a starch indicator It is made by adding 3 grams of soluble starch to 1 liter of heated water the solution is cooled before use starchiodine complex becomes unstable at temperatures above 35 °C Each species of plant has a unique type of starch granules in granular size shape and crystallization pattern Under the microscope starch grains stained with iodine illuminated from behind with polarized light show a distinctive Maltese cross effect also known as extinction cross and birefringence Food Starch is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet and is contained in many staple foods The major sources of starch intake worldwide are the cereals rice wheat and maize and the root vegetables potatoes and cassava Many other starchy foods are grown some only in specific climates including acorns arrowroot arracacha bananas barley breadfruit buckwheat canna colacasia katakuri kudzu malanga millet oats oca polynesian arrowroot sago sorghum sweet potatoes rye taro chestnuts water chestnuts and yams and many kinds of beans such as favas lentils mung beans peas and chickpeas Widely used prepared foods containing starch are bread pancakes cereals noodles pasta porridge and tortilla Digestive enzymes have problems digesting crystalline structures Raw starch will digest poorly in the duodenum and small intestine while bacterial degradation will take place mainly in the colon When starch is cooked the digestibility is increased Starch gelatinization during cake baking can be impaired by sugar competing for water preventing gelatinization and improving texture Historically people consumed large amounts of uncooked and unprocessed starchcontaining plants which contained high amounts of resistant starch Microbes within the large intestine fermented the starch produced shortchain fatty acids which were used as energy as well as maintenance and growth of the microbes As foods became more processed they were more easily digested and released more glucose in the small intestine less starch reached the large intestine and more energy was absorbed by the human body This shift in energy delivery may be one of the contributing factors to the development of metabolic disorders of modern life including obesity and diabetes Starch industry The starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds roots and tubers by wet grinding washing sieving and drying Today the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch tapioca wheat rice and potato starch To a lesser extent sources include rice sweet potato sago and mung bean Historically Florida arrowroot was also commercialized To this day starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants Untreated starch requires heat to thicken or gelatinize When a starch is precooked it can then be used to thicken instantly in cold water This is referred to as a pregelatinized starch Starch sugars Starch can be hydrolyzed into simpler carbohydrates by acids various enzymes or a combination of the two The resulting fragments are known as dextrins The extent of conversion is typically quantified by dextrose equivalent DE which is roughly the fraction of the glycosidic bonds in starch that have been broken These starch sugars are by far the most common starch based food ingredient and are used as sweetener in many drinks and foods They include Maltodextrin a lightly hydrolyzed DE 10–20 starch product used as a blandtasting filler and thickener Various glucose syrups DE 30–70 also called corn syrups in the US viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods Dextrose DE 100 commercial glucose prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch High fructose syrup made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme glucose isomerase until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose In the United States sugar prices are two to three times higher than in the rest of the world which makes high fructose corn syrup significantly cheaper so that it is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages Fructose also has better microbiological stability One kind of high fructose corn syrup HFCS55 is sweeter than sucrose because it is made with more fructose while the sweetness of HFCS42 is on par with sucrose Sugar alcohols such as maltitol erythritol sorbitol mannitol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate are sweeteners made by reducing sugars Modified starches A modified starch is a starch that has been chemically modified to allow the starch to function properly under conditions frequently encountered during processing or storage such as high heat high shear low pH freezethaw and cooling The modified food starches are E coded according to the

ingredients without an Enumber Typical modified starches for technical applications are cationic starches hydroxyethyl starch and carboxymethylated starches Use as food additive As an additive for food processing food starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings custards soups sauces gravies pie fillings and salad dressings and to make noodles and pastas Function as thickeners extenders emulsion stabilizers and are exceptional binders in processed meats Gummed sweets such as jelly beans and wine gums are not manufactured using a mold in the conventional sense A tray is filled with native starch and leveled A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1000 or so jelly beans The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put into a stove to set This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured Use in pharmaceutical industry In the pharmaceutical industry starch is also used as an excipient as tablet disintegrant or as binder Resistant starch Main article Resistant starch Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals High amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through baking mild extrusion and other food processing techniques It is used as an insoluble dietary fiber in processed foods such as bread pasta cookies crackers pretzels and other low moisture foods It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits Published studies have shown that resistant starch helps to improve insulin sensitivity increases satiety and improves markers of colonic function It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains Industrial applications Papermaking Papermaking is the largest nonfood application for starches globally consuming millions of metric tons annually In a typical sheet of copy paper for instance the starch content may be as high as 8 Both chemically modified and unmodified starches are used in papermaking In the wet part of the papermaking process generally called the wetend the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers cellulose and inorganic fillers Cationic starches together with other retention and internal sizing agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process wet strength and to provide strength to the final paper sheet dry strength In the dry end of the papermaking process the paper web is rewetted with a starch based solution The process is called surface sizing Starches used have been chemically or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry oxidized starch The sizestarch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses size presses Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or size for superior printing properties Starch is also used in paper coatings as one of the binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments binders and thickeners Coated paper has improved smoothness hardness whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics Corrugated board adhesives Corrugated board adhesives are the next largest application of nonfood starches globally Starch glues are mostly based on unmodified native starches plus some additive such as borax and caustic soda Part of the starch is gelatinized to carry the slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive The glue is applied on tips of the fluting The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner This is then dried under high heat which causes the rest of the uncooked starch in glue to swellgelatinize This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production Clothing starch Clothing or laundry starch is a liquid that is prepared by mixing a vegetable starch in water earlier preparations also had to be boiled and is used in the laundering of clothes Starch was widely used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and ruffs of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the welltodo During the 19th century and early 20th century it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of mens shirts and the ruffles of girls petticoats by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being ironed Aside from the smooth crisp edges it gave to clothing it served practical purposes as well Dirt and sweat from a persons neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing and would easily wash away along with the starch After each laundering the starch would be reapplied Today the product is sold in aerosol cans for home use Other Another large nonfood starch application is in the construction industry where starch is used in the gypsum wall board manufacturing process Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily gypsum Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid wall board The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering and also provide rigidity to the board Starch is used in the manufacture of various adhesives or glues for bookbinding wallpaper adhesives paper sack production tube winding gummed paper envelope adhesives school glues and bottle labeling Starch derivatives such as yellow dextrins can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work some of those forms use borax or soda ash which are mixed with the starch solution at 50–70 °C 122–158 °F to create a very good adhesive Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula Textile chemicals from starch warp sizing agents are used to reduce breaking of yarns during weaving Starch is mainly used to size cotton based yarns Modified starch is also used as textile printing thickener In oil exploration starch is used to adjust the viscosity of drilling fluid which is used to lubricate the drill head and suspend the grinding residue in petroleum extraction Starch is also used to make some packing peanuts and some drop ceiling tiles In the printing industry food grade starch is used in the manufacture of antisetoff spray powder used to separate printed sheets of paper to avoid wet ink being set off For body powder powdered corn starch is used as a substitute for talcum powder and similarly in other health and beauty products Starch is used to produce various bioplastics synthetic polymers that are biodegradable An example is polylactic acid based on glucose from starch Glucose from starch can be further fermented to biofuel corn ethanol using the socalled wet milling process Today most bioethanol production plants use the dry milling process to ferment corn or other feedstock directly to ethanol Hydrogen production could use glucose form starch as the raw material using enzymes Occupational safety and health The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit Permissible exposure limit for starch exposure in the workplace as 15 mgm total exposure and 5 mgm respiratory exposure over an 8hour workday The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a Recommended exposure limit REL of 10 mgm total exposure and 5 mgm respiratory exposure over an 8hour workday See also Acrylamide which is present in fried and baked foods Starch production Starch analysis References External links Starch Stärke scientific journal on
