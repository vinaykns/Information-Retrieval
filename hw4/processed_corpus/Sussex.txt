and the city of Brighton and Hove Brighton and Hove was created as a unitary authority in 1997 and granted City status in 2000 Until then Chichester was Sussexs only city Sussex has three main geographic subregions each oriented approximately east to west In the southwest is the fertile and densely populated coastal plain North of this are the rolling chalk hills of the South Downs beyond which is the wellwooded Sussex Weald The name derives from the Kingdom of Sussex which was founded according to legend by Ælle of Sussex in AD 477 In 825 it was absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex and subsequently into the kingdom of England It was the home of some of Europes earliest hominids whose remains have been found at Boxgrove and was invaded by the Romans and is the site of the Battle of Hastings In 1974 the LordLieutenant of Sussex was replaced with one each for East and West Sussex which became separate ceremonial counties Sussex continues to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region It has had a single police force since 1968 and its name is in common use in the media In 2007 Sussex Day was created to celebrate the countys rich culture and history Based on the traditional emblem of Sussex a blue shield with six gold martlets the flag of Sussex was recognised by the Flag Institute in 2011 In 2013 Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of Englands 39 historic counties including Sussex Toponymy The name Sussex is derived from the Middle English Suthsæxe which is in turn derived from the Old English SuthSeaxe which means land or people of the South Saxons cf Essex Middlesex and Wessex The South Saxons were a Germanic tribe that settled in the region from the North German Plain during the 5th and 6th centuries The earliest known usage of the term South Saxons Latin Australes Saxones is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king Noðhelm although the term may well have been in use for some time before that The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late The New Latin word Suthsexia was used for Sussex by Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in his 1645 map Three United States counties in Delaware New Jersey and Virginia and a former countyland division of Western Australia are named after Sussex Symbols Main article Symbols of Sussex The flag of Sussex consists of six gold martlets or heraldic swallows on a blue background blazoned as Azure six martlets or Officially recognised by the Flag Institute on 20 May 2011 its design is based on the heraldic shield of Sussex The first known recording of this emblem being used to represent the county was in 1611 when cartographer John Speed deployed it to represent the Kingdom of the South Saxons However it seems that Speed was repeating an earlier association between the emblem and the county rather than being the inventor of the association It is now firmly regarded that the county emblem originated and derived from the coat of arms of the 14th century Knight of the Shire Sir John de Radynden Sussex’s six martlets are today held to symbolise the traditional six subdivisions of the county known as rapes Sussex by the Sea is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex it was composed by William WardHiggs in 1907 perhaps originally from the lyrics of Rudyard Kiplings poem entitled Sussex Adopted by the Royal Sussex Regiment and popularised in World War I it is sung at celebrations across the county including those at Lewes Bonfire and at sports matches including those of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club and Sussex County Cricket Club The county day called Sussex Day is celebrated on 16 June the same day as the feast day of St Richard of Chichester Sussexs patron saint whose shrine at Chichester Cathedral was an important place of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages Sussexs motto We wunt be druv is a Sussex dialect expression meaning we will not be pushed around and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women The roundheaded rampion also known as the Pride of Sussex was adopted as Sussexs county flower in 2002 Geography Main article Geography of Sussex See also Geology of East Sussex Landscape The physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the Wealden anticline the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction the Weald itself and the South Downs Natural England has identified the following seven national character areas in Sussex South Coast Plain South Downs Wealden Greensand Low Weald High Weald Pevensey Levels Romney Marshes At 280m Blackdown is the highest point in Sussex or county top Ditchling Beacon 248m is the highest point in East Sussex At 113 kilometres 70 miles long the River Medway is the longest river flowing through Sussex The longest river entirely in Sussex is the River Arun which is 60 kilometres 37 miles long Sussexs largest lakes are manmade reservoirs The largest is Bewl Water on the Kent border while the largest wholly within Sussex is Ardingly Reservoir Climate The coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring Hampshire are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas sea breezes blowing off the sea tend to clear any cloud from the coast Most of Sussex lies in Hardiness zone 8 the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton which lies in the milder zone 9 Rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with 950 mm 37 in of rainfall per year The close proximity of Sussex to the Continent of Europe results in cold spells in winter and hot humid weather in summer The climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea which because of its tendency to warm up slower than land can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer In the autumn months the coast sometimes has higher temperatures Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing southwesterly frontal systems In winter the east winds can be as cold as further inland Selsey is known as a tornado hotspot with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986 1998 and 2000 with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1000 buildings The sunshine average is approximately 1900 hours a year this is much higher than the UK average of 1340 hours a year Conurbations Most of Sussexs population is distributed in an eastwest line along the English Channel coast or on the eastwest line of the A272 The exception to this pattern is the 20th century northsouth development on the A23Brighton line corridor Sussexs main link to London Sussexs population is dominated by the BrightonWorthingLittlehampton conurbation that with a population of over 470000 is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussexs population According to the ONS urban area populations for continuous builtup areas these are the 5 largest conurbations population figures from the 2001 census Population The combined population of Sussex is about 16 million In 2011 Sussex had a population density of 425 per km higher than the average for England of 407 per km The earliest statement as to the population of Sussex is made by Bede who describes the county as containing in 681 land of 7000 families allowing ten to a family a reasonable estimate at that date the total population would be 70000 In 1693 the county is stated to have contained 21537 houses The 1801 census found that the population was 159311 The decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase of population during several centuries although after the massacre of St Bartholomew upwards of 1500 Huguenots landed at Rye and in 1685 after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes many more refugees were added to the county The area of the ancient county is 933887 acres 377931 ha with a population in 1891 of 550446 and in 1901 of 605202 History Main article History of Sussex Beginnings Finds at Eartham Pit in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe dating back some 500000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or Homo heidelbergensis At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings tools have been found that date from around 35000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last Neanderthals in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses bison mammoth and woolly rhinos Around 6000BC the ice sheet over the North Sea melted sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their Mesolithic kinsmen to the south Later in the Neolithic period the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britains largest and most important flintmining centres The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture The oldest of these mines at Church Hill in Findon has been carbondated to 4500BC to 3750BC making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain Flint tools from Cissbury have been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean Sussex is rich in remains from the Bronze and Iron Ages in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the Devils Jumps and Cissbury Ring one of Britains largest hillforts Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75BC people from the Atrebates one of the tribes of the Belgae a mix of Celtic and German stock started invading and occupying southern Britain This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under Julius Caesar that temporarily occupied the southeast in 55BC Soon after the first Roman invasion had ended the Celtic Regnenses tribe under their leader Commius occupied the Manhood Peninsula Tincomarus and then Cogidubnus followed Commius as rulers of the Regnenses Roman Canton At the time of the Roman conquest in AD43 there was an oppidum in the southern part of their territory probably in the Selsey region A number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent According to this theory the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica king of the Atrebates who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire Sussex was home to the magnificent Roman Palace at Fishbourne by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps Much of Sussex was a Roman canton of the Regnenses or Regni with its capital at Noviomagus Reginorum modernday Chichester The Romans built villas especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester one of the best preserved being that at Bignor Christianity first came to Sussex at this time but faded away when the Romans left in the 5th century The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in Britain probably deposited after 475 AD well after the Roman departure from Britain around 410 AD Saxon Kingdom Main article Kingdom of Sussex The foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the AngloSaxon Chronicle which states that in the year AD 477 Ælle landed with his three sons Having fought on the banks of the Mearcredesburna it seems Aelle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty After Aelle’s forces seized the Saxon Shore fort of Anderida the South Saxons were able to gradually colonise free of RomanoBritish control and extend their territory westwards to link with the Saxon settlement at Highdown Hill Aelle was recognised as the first Bretwalda or overlord of southern Britain He was probably the most senior of the AngloSaxon kings and led the illfated campaign against King Arthur at Mount Badon By the end of the 7th century the region around Selsey and Chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom In the 660s670s King Aethelwealh of Sussex formed an alliance with the Mercian king Wulfhere and together they took the Isle of Wight from the West Saxons probably at the battle of Biedanheafele As Mercias first Christian king Wulfhere insisted that Æthelwealh also convert to Christianity Æthelwealh was baptised in Mercia with Wulfhere as his sponsor Wulfhere gave the Isle of Wight and Meon Valley to Aethelwealh with Wulfhere acting as overlord The alliance with Mercia was sealed with Æthelwealh taking the hand of Eabe a Mercian princess in marriage Wilfrid the exiled bishop of York came to Sussex in 681 and with King Æthelwealhs approval set up a mission to convert the people of Sussex to Christianity Æthelwealh gave Wilfrid land on the Manhood peninsula close to his own royal estate and Wilfrid founded Selsey Abbey The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh was killed by Cædwalla a prince of Wessex Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealhs grant of land and Wilfrid built his Selsey Abbey Cædwalla was driven out by the South Saxon nobles Berthun and Andhun The South Saxons fought off the West Saxons in 722 and again in 725 At the end of the 8th century Ealdwulf was perhaps the last independent king of Sussex after which Sussex and other southern kingdoms came increasingly under Mercian rule Mercias grip was shattered in 825 at the battle of Ellendun after which Sussex and the other southern kingdoms came under the control of Wessex which later grew into the kingdom of England Norman Sussex Sussex was the venue for the momentous Battle of Hastings the decisive victory in the Norman conquest of England In September 1066 William of Normandy landed with his forces at Pevensey and erected a wooden castle at Hastings from which they raided the surrounding area The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king Harold Godwinson who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief seat was probably in Bosham After having marched his exhausted army all the way from Yorkshire Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings where Englands army was defeated and Harold was killed It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle as the countys thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated William built Battle Abbey at the site of the battle with the exact spot where Harold fell marked by the high altar Sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any English county under the Normans for it was the heartland of King Harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion The county was of great importance to the Normans Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy The countys existing subdivisions known as rapes were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of Williams most trusted barons Castles were built to defend the territories including at Arundel Bramber Lewes Pevensey and Hastings Sussexs bishop Æthelric II was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with and William the Conquerors personal chaplain Stigand The Normans also built Chichester Cathedral and moved the seat of Sussexs bishopric from Selsey to Chichester The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex including New Shoreham the centre of modern ShorehambySea Battle Arundel Uckfield and Winchelsea In 1264 the Sussex Downs were the location of the Battle of Lewes in which Simon de Montfort and his fellow barons captured Prince Edward later Edward I the son and heir of Henry III The subsequent treaty known as the Mise of Lewes led to Montfort summoning the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation A provisional administration was set up consisting of Montfort the Bishop of Chichester and the Earl of Gloucester These three were to elect a council of nine to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached Sussex under the Plantagenets During the Hundred Years War Sussex found itself on the frontline convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed French pirates Hastings Rye and Winchelsea were all burnt during this period and all three towns became part of the Cinque Ports a loose federation for supplying ships for the countrys security Also at this time Amberley and Bodiam castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers Early modern Sussex Like the rest of the country the Church of Englands split with Rome during the reign of Henry VIII was felt in Sussex In 1538 there was a royal order for the demolition of the shrine of Saint Richard in Chichester Cathedral with Thomas Cromwell saying that there was a certain kind of idolatry about the shrine In the reign of Queen Mary 41 people in Sussex were burnt at the stake for their Protestant beliefs Elizabeth reestablished the break with Rome when she passed the 1559 Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity Under Elizabeth I religious intolerance continued albeit on a lesser scale with several people being executed for their Catholic beliefs Sussex escaped the worst ravages of the English Civil War although in 1642 there were sieges at Arundel and Chichester and a skirmish at Haywards Heath when Royalists marching towards Lewes were intercepted by local Parliamentarians The Royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner Despite its being under Parliamentarian control Charles II was able to journey through the county after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 to make his escape to France from the port of Shoreham Late modern and contemporary Sussex The Sussex coast was greatly modified by the social movement of sea bathing for health which became fashionable among the wealthy in the second half of the 18th century Resorts developed all along the coast including at Brighton Hastings Worthing and Bognor At the beginning of the 19th century agricultural labourers conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed those in work faced their wages being forced down Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers seasonal workers had been found dead of starvation The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots first in neighbouring Kent and then in Sussex where they lasted for several weeks although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the Swing Riots Railways spread across Sussex in the 19th century and county councils were created for Sussexs eastern and western divisions in 1889 During World War I on the eve of the Battle of the Somme on 30 June 1916 the Royal Sussex Regiment took part in the Battle of the Boars Head at RichebourglAvoué The day subsequently became known as The Day Sussex Died Over a period of less than five hours the 17 officers and 349 men were killed including 12 sets of brothers including three from one family A further 1000 men were wounded or taken prisoner With the declaration of the World War II Sussex found itself part of the countrys frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the Battle of Britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed As the Sussex regiments served overseas the defence of the county was undertaken by units of the Home Guard with help from the First Canadian Army During the lead up to the DDay landings the people of Sussex were witness to the buildup of military personnel and materials including the assembly of landing crafts and construction of Mulberry harbours off the countys coast In the postwar era the New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of a new town As part of the Local Government Act 1972 the eastern and western divisions of Sussex were made into the ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex in 1974 Boundaries were changed and a large part of the rape of Lewes was transferred from the eastern division into West Sussex along with Gatwick Airport which was historically part of the county of Surrey Governance See also History of local government in Sussex Politics Main articles Sussex UK Parliament constituency High Sheriff of Sussex Lord Lieutenant of Sussex and Custos Rotulorum of Sussex From 1290 Sussex returned two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of England Each county returned two MPs and each borough designated by Royal charter also returned two MPs After the union with Scotland two members represented the county in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832 After the Reform Act 1832 some of the larger industrial towns of northern England were enfranchised for the first time and smaller English boroughs known as Rotten Boroughs were disenfranchised including Bramber East Grinstead Seaford Steyning and Winchelsea in Sussex The Reform Act of 1832 divided what had been a single county constituency into eastern and western divisions with two representatives elected for each division The reforms of the 19th century made the electoral system more representative but it was not until 1928 that there was universal suffrage Law Headquartered in Lewes Home Office policing in Sussex has been provided by Sussex Police since 1968

thirdtier Crown Court at Chichester The local prison in Sussex for men is Lewes Prison and there is also a Category D prison at Ford Administrative divisions Historic subdivisions Main article Rape county subdivision A rape was a traditional subdivision of the county of Sussex Their origin is unknown but they appear to predate the Norman Conquest Each rape was split into several hundreds At the time of the Norman Conquest there were four rapes Arundel Lewes Pevensey and Hastings The rape of Bramber was created later in the 11th century and the rape of Chichester was created in the 13th century Modern local authority areas Sussex is divided into two administrative counties and one unitary authority Brighton and Hove The divisions of east Sussex and west Sussex have their roots in the churchs division of the county at the river Adur into east and west parts divided from at least the 11th century into the archdeaconry of Chichester and the archdeaconry of Lewes With Sussexs cathedral located at Chichester in the far west of the county 9 miles from the western boundary and 90 miles from the eastern boundary it became practical to divide the county into two sections The three eastern rapes of Sussex became east Sussex and the three western rapes became west Sussex An act of Henry VII dating from 1504 directed that for convenience the two halves of the county should have separate administrations Quarter Sessions This situation was recognised by the County of Sussex Act 1865 Under the Local Government Act 1888 the two divisions became two administrative counties along with three county boroughs Brighton Hastings and from 1911 Eastbourne Monarchy and peerage Main articles Kings of Sussex Duke of Sussex and Earl of Sussex Created in the fifth century the kingdom of Sussex continued until its absorption into the kingdom of Wessex and later England in 825 In charters Sussexs monarchs were sometimes referred to as ealdormen or Dux in Latin which is sometimes translated as duke The early Earls of Arundel up to 1243 were often also called Earls of Sussex In 1801 the title of Duke of Sussex was created and conferred on The Prince Augustus Frederick the sixth son of George III Since he had no legitimate issue the title became extinct on his death in 1843 Although there was speculation that the dukedom would pass to Prince Andrew or Prince William the title is currently one of six inactive British royal titles Economy Much of the Sussex Weald consists of wet sticky clays or droughtprone acid sands and is often broken up into to small irregular fields and woods by the topography making it unsuitable for intensive arable farming In these areas pastoral or mixed farming has always been the pattern with field boundaries often little changed since the medieval period Sussex cattle are the descendants of the draught oxen which continued to be used in the Weald longer than in other parts of England The chalk downlands were traditionally grazed by large numbers of small Southdown sheep suited to the low fertility of the pasture until the coming of artificial fertiliser made cereal growing worthwhile There are still fishing fleets notably at Rye and Hastings but the number of boats is much reduced There are working harbours at Rye Hastings Newhaven and Shoreham whilst Pagham and Chichester harbours cater for leisure craft as does Brighton Marina Sussex had an iron working industry since the Roman period The large supply of wood in the county made it a favourable centre for the industry all smelting being done with charcoal till the middle of the 18th century The glass making industry started on the SussexSurrey border in the early 13th century and flourished till the 17th century The Mid Sussex area had a thriving clay industry in the first quarter of the 20th century Sussex has considerable variation in wealth and deprivation Gross Value Added a measure of output was £27464 million for Sussex in 2009
