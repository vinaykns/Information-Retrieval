 Mallory Park is a motor racing circuit situated in the village of Kirkby Mallory just off the A47 between Leicester and Hinckley in central England Originally used for grasstrack until 1955 a new basically oval hardsurfaced course was constructed for 1956 with a later extension forming a loop with a hairpin bend With the car circuit measuring only 135 miles 2173 km it is amongst the shortest permanent race circuits in the UK However chicanes introduced to reduce speeds in motorcycle events mean that the Superbike Circuit is now slightly longer at 141 miles 2269 km Shorter UK circuits are Lydden Hill Brands Hatch Indy circuit Scotlands Knockhill and Silverstones diminutive Stowe circuit The Circuit The circuit has a number of formations founded on a basic onemile oval with the majority of configurations including the northerly extension to the tight 180° Shaws Hairpin At the other end of the circuit lies the long righthand Gerards Bend Gerards is about a third of a mile long and turns through nearly 200° It was named after local racing hero Bob Gerard who opened the newly reconstructed circuit on 25 April 1956 Unusually there are a number of large lakes occupying approximately half of the circuit infield Despite its short length and Shaws Hairpin the tightest corner of any UK track other than the hairpin on Cadwell Parks short circuit Mallory is a fast circuit To reduce speeds for motorcycle racing a pair of chicanes have been introduced together with a revised exit to Gerards Edwinas was added toward the end of the straight following Gerards named after former managing director of the circuit Edwina Overend and the Bus Stop Chicane on the descent to the sweeping left kink the Devils Elbow a blind downhill off camber lefthander before the start–finish line on Kirkby Straight In 2003 a new complex was added toward the end of Gerards curve This sequence of bends was designed to reduce speeds on entry to Edwinas and to prevent motorcycles from colliding as they jockey for position into the chicane Mallory Park does not have any true permanent garage facilities although there are a handful of open garages in the pitlane History Origins – 1950s The estate at Mallory Park has many historical connections the oldest being the unique AngloSaxons defended moat which is now known as Kirkby Moats while a Roman road passes through the estate Fast forward to the 18th century when in 1762 Sir Cleoberry Noel became Viscount Wentworth the title descended on the distaff side Lord Byron married into the Wentworth family and it is said on his visits to Mallory he wrote beneath the shade of the Lebanon cedar tree which still stands in the grounds of Kirkby Hall The last occupant of Kirkby Hall was Herbert Clarkson who died in 1941 when it was sold During the Second World War the circuit started life Royal Air Force Station Kirkby Mallory a standby landing ground SLG during WWII and closed in 1947 The hall was a large house which was demolished in 1952 leaving only the stable block and the coach house which now forms the circuit offices workshops hotel pub and restaurant The estate of 300 acres was sold by auction in 1953 and was bought by a Mr Moult of Derby who planned to have horse racing on the disused pony trotting track Following the war Mallory became a pony trotting circuit in the late 1940s which defined the outline of the oval track still in use today After the financial collapse of the equestrian club responsible for the circuit Kirkby Mallory Racing Association the track was hired by various motorcycle clubs for grass track motorcycle and motorcycle sidecar racing For example between September 1949 until 1954 the Leicester Query Motorcycle Club held grass track races In 1955 the estate was purchased by Clive Wormleighton under whose influence the present tarmac was constructed at a cost of £60000 in 1956 Upon completion of the building work a circuit test was held on 26 April when local Grand Prix driver Bob Gerard and Maurice Cann respectively conducted a CooperBristol Formula Two car and a Moto Guzzi motorcycle around the track Gerald managing an 81 mph lap The very first race was held on 29 April when the Leicester Query Club organised a motorcycle meeting A large crowd in excess of 20000 spectators attended the Grand Opening event on 13 May 1956 248 riders arrived in Leicestershire for this meeting which saw George Salter set the first lap record at a speed of 8408 mph riding a Norton bike Cars first appeared at the Whit Monday meeting in event being organised by Nottingham Sports Car Club The first car race victory went to D Rees in an Austin Many famous racing stars have raced at Mallory over the years indeed a young John Surtees raced against his father Jack Surtees While Jack was a successfully grass track racer at Mallory John went on to be only World Champion on both two and four wheels Famous competitors who have raced at Mallory include John Surtees who won the first ‘Race of the Year’ in 1958 While the 1960 race saw Mike Hailwood win and set a new lap record of 89 mph Both Hailwood and Surtees along with Jim Clark and Colin Chapman are commemorated with Statues at the front gate Around this time Clive Wormleighton added the lakes which were formed by adding the sluice gate across the Brook 1960s Clive Wormleighton continued to run the circuit very successfully until 1962 when ownership passed to the Grovewood Securities in the July the previous owner remaining in a consultancy capacity until the end of September Before this on 11 June 1962 Mallory Park saw it first nonchampionship Formula One International 2000 Guineas race won by John Surtees aboard a Lola Mk4 from the privately entered Lotuses of Jack Brabham and Graham Hill Surtees was now a major race winner at Mallory on both 2 and 4 wheels Over the next two years a considerable amount of money was spent on Mallory with the building of new spectator stands and a new commentators’ press and timekeepers’ boxes Further developments took place raising the standard of the track Crowd grew and in 1962 over 50000 people paid to see the Post TT International Motor Cycle meeting when Mike Hailwood won improving the lap record to 9170 mph This led to it Race of the Year and Sidecar race of the Year being sponsored by the Daily Mail Under the control of Grovewood Securities Mallory enjoyed its golden days in the 1960s and 1970s with some of the greatest names in motorsport competing there Amongst these a young Austrian who arrived for the Whit Sunday meeting in 1964 for his first race in England in a new Formula Two Brabham – Jochen Rindt He asked Denny Hulme if he could follow him round to learn the circuit and then proceeded to set fastest time in qualifying despite being delayed in the race he finished third behind the reigning World Champion Jim Clark and his experienced teammate Peter Arundell 1970s Throughout the Sixties and Seventies the circuit hosted almost every major British car and bike championship However on occasions there were European Championship events For example 12 March 1972 saw FIA European Formula Two Championship with Dave Morgan winning in his Reeves Racing BrabhamFord BT38 from the future Ferrari pairing of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann 1970 saw Mallory used as a venue for cycle racing with the World road race championships being run on a road course starting and finishing at Mallory and incorporating the circuit reversed each lap The professional event was won by illfated Belgian JeanPierre Monseré Formula Two returned again 1973 this time Morgan could only finish third The victor was Frenchman JeanPierre Jarier in his works MarchBMW 732 Second was Dave McConnell After a little over 20 years the owners of Mallory Park decided that enough was enough and offered the estate for sale no doubt the expense of bringing Brands Hatch which Grovewood also owned up to current Grand Prix standards had some effort on the decision and the reopening of Donington Park which was only some 20 miles away may have influenced the decision Whatever the reasons Mallory was once more on the market but reportedly with a restriction in its future use for motor sport on its future use for motor racing although planning permission had been obtained for the erection of 30 dwelling on the estate Meanwhile famously the Bay City Rollers tartan army played a concert during a BBCorganised Fun Day on 18 May 1975 on a stage specifically constructed in the middle of the lake 1980s and onwards Enter a very determined lady Edwina Overend who was the competitions secretary of the Midlands Centre of the British Racing and Sports Car Club BRSCC As the time passed and the 1982 season drew to its close the expected cessation of racing at Mallory loomed large and various time wasters had come and gone Overend approached Chris Meek with a view to his purchasing the estate Meek was a wellknown racing driver and businessman who effected the purchase late in 1982 and reopened the circuit on 29 May 1983 the first race of the new era being organised by the 750 Motor Club There was no interruption to the programme and Mallory went from strength to strength apart from a hiccup from in December 1985 when the local borough council served a Noise Nuisance Order which restricted use of the circuit to 40 days a year On Sundays there is an absolute curfew and no racing engines must be run after 6 pm Mallory Park has hosted all major motor racing formulae to be contested in postwar England – European Formula Two Championship British Formula One Series Group 7 sport cars European Formula 5000 British Formula Three Championship and British Saloon Car Championship In the 1981 programme the name of Damon Hill appears as one of the ‘Ams’ in the Yamaha RD350 ProAm series Annually in October The Festival of Sidecars takes place No solo machines compete but sidecars of all categories are entered including threewheelers such as those made by the Morgan Motor Company From the mid1990s the BRSCC promoted EuroCars V6 and V8 saloonoutline cars which had graduated from the stock car circuits At Mallory Park they ran anticlockwise on the oval circuit Records The history of the 100 mph lap at the Leicestershire circuit is interesting the first one was a long time coming for it was not until 1966 that it finally happened when on 29 May Denny Hulme took a Lola T70 round in 476sec at a speed of 10210 mph Two years later Roy Pike established the first Formula Three 100 mph lap in a Titan which he took round in 48sec 10125 mph With coming of the large capacity singleseater like the Formula 5000 and Formula One cars the outright record continue to fall until in 1979 Ricardo Zunino took an Arrows A1 round in 40065sec at an incredible 12132 mph 22 years after the 100 mph late Vincenzo Sospiri established the first such lap in a Formula Ford when he drove a Van Diemen RF88 at 10041 mph in 4844sec By the end of the 20th Century the outright lap record on the full circuit which still stands to the credit of Johan Rajamäki driving a Formula One FootworkJudd FA13 in the BOSS Formula at 12712 in 3823secs it was set on 5 May 1997 On the oval circuit the record has stood since May 1995 the credit of a V6 Ford Mondeo Eurocar of Ian Fewings at 10651 mph in 3384sec While on two wheels the full lap record was set during the 2008 ‘Race of the year’ at 51271secs a speed of 97599 mph by Tom Sykes abroad a 1300cc Suzuki Motocross Circuit Adjacent to the road course is a purposebuilt motocross circuit which played host to the Grand Prix of Great Britain in 2008 The event was being organised by offroad promotions company RHL who originally planned to use the former Grand Prix circuit at Foxhill near Swindon until it became apparent that the infrastructure at the Wiltshire venue would not be sufficient for such a highprofile event The event was seen as a success by fans with over 30000 fans in attendance over the weekend However the Grand Prix only returned once more in 2009 The circuit has been unused since late 2013 and has fallen into disuse Motocross activities ended due to noise concerns and in the interests of improving relations with the local community the new owners of the circuit have no plans to recommence Motocross Major Race Results Formula One
