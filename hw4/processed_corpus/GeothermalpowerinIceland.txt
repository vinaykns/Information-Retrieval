 Due to the geological location of Iceland over a rift in continental plates the high concentration of volcanoes in the area is often an advantage in the generation of geothermal energy the heating and making of electricity During winter pavements near these areas such as Reykjavik and Akureyri are heated up Five major geothermal power plants exist in Iceland which produce approximately 262 2010 of the nations electricity In addition geothermal heating meets the heating and hot water requirements of approximately 87 of all buildings in Iceland Apart from geothermal energy 738 of the nation’s electricity is generated by hydro power and 01 from fossil fuels Consumption of primary geothermal energy in 2004 was 797 petajoules PJ approximately 534 of the total national consumption of primary energy 1491 PJ The corresponding share for hydro power was 172 petroleum was 263 and coal was 3 Plans are underway to turn Iceland into a 100 fossilfuelfree nation in the near future For example Icelands abundant geothermal energy has enabled renewable energy initiatives such as Carbon Recycling Internationals carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process The following are the five largest power stations in Iceland Hellisheiði Power Station 303 MW Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station 120 MW Reykjanes Power Station 100 MW Svartsengi Power Station 765 MW Krafla Power Station 60 MW See also List of power stations in Iceland Renewable energy in Iceland The Geothermal energy exhibition Iceland Deep Drilling Project Renewable energy by country References External links Iceland Energy Authority Icelandic Energy Portal More information about Svartsengi powerplant More information about Nesjavellir powerplant More information about Krafla powerplant More information about Hellisheidi powerplant Photo Gallery from islandsmyndiris Photo Geothermal power station Svartsengi Photos of Geothermal power plants at Reykjanes Svartsengi Tiroler Bi Mannvit Engineering of Iceland RES School for Renewable Energy Science in Iceland Keilir Atlantic Center of Excellence Icelandic GeoSurvey
