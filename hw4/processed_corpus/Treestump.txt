 After a tree has been cut and felled the stump or tree stump is usually a small remaining portion of the trunk with the roots still in the ground Stumps may show the agedefining rings of a tree The study of these rings is known as dendrochronology Regeneration Stumps both those on the ground and stumps of removed branches are sometimes able to regenerate into new trees Often a deciduous tree that has been cut will resprout in multiple places around the edge of the stump or from the roots Depending on whether the tree is being removed permanently or whether the forest is expected to recover this can be either desirable or undesirable Stump sprouts can grow very quickly and sometimes become viable trees themselves either for aesthetics or timber due to the existing root structure however the cut portion of the trunk may weaken the sprouts and introduce disease into the newly forming trees The process of deliberately cutting a tree to a stump to regrow is known as coppicing Stump removal Tree stumps can be difficult to remove from the ground They can be dug out shredded with a stump grinder or burnt A common method for stump removal is to use one of the many chemical stump removal products so long as immediate results are not needed These stump removers are mostly made of potassium nitrate KNO3 and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump After an average of 4â€“6 weeks the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces If time is a limiting factor setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer Historically an explosive called stumping powder was used to blast stumps into bits Stump harvesting In plantation forests in parts of Europe stumps are sometimes pulled out of the ground using a specially adapted tracked excavator to supply wood fuel for biomass power stations Stump harvesting may provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the biomass power sector See also Trees portal Living stump Stump harvesting References Buckley GP 1992 Ecology and Management of Coppice Woodlands Springer 336 pagesISBN 0412431106 ISBN 9780412431104 Schenk HJ and RB Jackson 2002 The global biogeography of roots Ecological Monographs 72 3 311328 External links Stump harvesting in Sweden Regeneration after stump harvesting Stumps as a resource in Finland Stump harvesting and forest decomposers
