 Runoftheriver hydroelectricity ROR or runofriver hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided Runoftheriver power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage A plant without pondage has no water storage and is therefore subject to seasonal river flows Thus the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source while a plant with pondage can regulate the water flow at all times and can serve as a peaking power plant or base load power plant Concept Runoftheriver or ROR hydroelectricity is considered ideal for streams or rivers that can sustain a minimum flow or those regulated by a lake or reservoir upstream A small dam is usually built to create a headpond ensuring that there is enough water entering the penstock pipes that lead to the turbines which are at a lower elevation Projects with pondage as opposed to those without pondage can store water for daily load demands In general projects divert some or most of a rivers flow up to 95 of mean annual discharge through a pipe andor tunnel leading to electricitygenerating turbines then return the water back to the river downstream ROR projects are dramatically different in design and appearance from conventional hydroelectric projects Traditional hydro dams store enormous quantities of water in reservoirs sometimes flooding large tracts of land In contrast runofriver projects do not have most of the disadvantages associated with dams and reservoirs which is why they are often considered environmentally friendly The use of the term runoftheriver for power projects varies around the world Some may consider a project ROR if power is produced with no water storage while limited storage is considered ROR by others Developers may mislabel a project ROR to soothe public perception about its environmental or social effects The Bureau of Indian Standards describes runoftheriver hydroelectricity as A power station utilizing the run of the river flows for generation of power with sufficient pondage for supplying water for meeting diurnal or weekly fluctuations of demand In such stations the normal course of the river is not materially altered Many of the larger ROR projects have been designed to a scale and generating capacity rivaling some traditional hydro dams For example the Beauharnois Hydroelectric Generating Station in Quebec is rated at 1853 MW and a 2006 proposal in British Columbia Canada has been designed to generate 1027 megawatts capacity Some run of the river projects are downstream of other dams and reservoirs The run of the river project didnt build the reservoir but does take advantage of the water supplied by it An example would be the 1995 1436 MW La Grande1 generating station previous upstream dams and reservoirs are part of the 1980s James Bay Project Advantages When developed with care to footprint size and location ROR hydro projects can create sustainable energy minimizing impacts to the surrounding environment and nearby communities Advantages include Cleaner power fewer greenhouse gases Like all hydroelectric power runoftheriver hydro harnesses the natural potential energy of water eliminating the need to burn coal or natural gas to generate the electricity needed by consumers and industry Moreover runoftheriver hydroelectric plants do not require the formation of a reservoir unlike conventional hydroelectric plants thus eliminating the methane and carbon dioxide emissions generally caused by the decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir of a hydroelectric dam Less floodingreservoirs Substantial flooding of the upper part of the river is not required for runofriver projects as a large reservoir is not required As a result people living at or near the river dont need to be relocated and natural habitats and productive farmlands are not wiped out Disadvantages Unfirm power RunoftheRiver power is considered an unfirm source of power a runoftheriver project has little or no capacity for energy storage and hence cant coordinate the output of electricity generation to match consumer demand It thus generates much more power during times when seasonal river flows are high ie spring freshet and depending on location much less during drier summer months or frozen winter months Availability of sites The potential power at a site is a result of the head and flow of water By damming a river the head is available to generate power at the face of the dam Where a dam may create a reservoir hundreds of kilometers long in run of the river the head is usually delivered by a canal pipe or tunnel constructed upstream of the power house Due to the cost of upstream construction a steep drop in the river is desirable Environmental impacts Small wellsited ROR projects can be developed with minimal environmental impacts Larger projects have more environmental concerns For example Plutonic Power Corps canceled Bute Inlet Hydroelectric Project in BC would have seen three clusters of runofriver projects with 17 river diversions as proposed this runofriver project would divert over 90 kilometres of streams and rivers into tunnels and pipelines requiring 443 km of new transmission line 267 km of permanent roads and 142 bridges to be built in wilderness areas British Columbias mountainous terrain and wealth of big rivers have made it a global testing ground for runofriver technology As of March 2010 there were 628 applications pending for new water licences solely for the purposes of power generation – representing more than 750 potential points of river diversion Concerns Diverting large amounts of river water reduces river flows affecting water velocity and depth minimizing habitat quality for fish and aquatic organisms reduced flows can lead to excessively warm water for salmon and other fish in summer New access roads and transmission lines can cause extensive habitat fragmentation for many species allowing the introduction of invasive species and increases in undesirable human activities like illegal hunting The lack of reservoir storage may result in intermittent operation reducing the projects viability Major examples Main article List of runoftheriver hydroelectric power stations Belo Monte Dam 11233 megawatts
