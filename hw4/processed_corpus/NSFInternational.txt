 Not to be confused with the National Science Foundation NSF International is a product testing inspection and certification organization based in Ann Arbor Michigan History NSF International was founded in 1944 from the University of Michigans School of Public Health as the National Sanitation Foundation NSF to standardize sanitation and food safety requirements The process established to develop NSF Internationals first standards regarding the sanitation of soda fountain and luncheonette equipment became the process by which NSF International developed other public health and safety standards To date NSF has developed more than 80 public health and safety American National Standards As NSF expanded services beyond sanitation and into new international markets the name was changed to NSF International in 1990 NSF International is an accredited independent thirdparty certification body that tests and certifies products to verify they meet these public health and safety standards Products that meet these standards bear the NSF mark NSF International has been collaborating with the World Health Organization since 1997 in water quality and safety food safety and indoor environments NSF operates more than 165000 square feet 15300Â m of laboratory space and serves companies in more than 150 countries worldwide Its 1200plus staff located worldwide inc N S America Europe Africa Asia Oceania includes microbiologists toxicologists chemists engineers food safety specialists environmental and public health professionals Programs The NSF Food Safety Division provides accredited services across all supply chain sectors from agriculture produce processing distribution and dairy to seafood retail and restaurants Services include Global Food Safety Initiative GFSI certification SQF BRC GLOBALGAP FSSC IFS Aquaculture Certification Council ACC Marine Stewardship Council MSC certification auditing consulting and technical services HACCP validation and inspection and organic and glutenfree certification through QAI Quality Assurance International NSF Food Safety also certifies foodservice equipment nonfood compounds and bottled waterbeverages Many food codes in the US require food equipment used in commercial establishments that is certified to NSF commercial food equipment standards The NSF Water Division certifies products that come into contact with drinking water such as plumbing components water treatment chemicals and drinking water filters as well as pool and spa equipment NSF led the development of American National Standards for all materials and products that treat or come in contact with drinking water to help protect public health and the environment and minimize adverse health effects In 1990 the US EPA replaced its own drinking water product advisory program with these NSF standards Today most plumbing codes require certification to NSF standards for pipes and plumbing components in commercial and residential buildings Recently introduced programs include HACCP for Building Water Systems The NSF Health Sciences Division offers training and education consulting auditing good manufacturing practice GMP and good laboratory practice GLP testing certification RD and regulatory guidance for the pharmaceutical medical device and dietary supplement industries throughout the product lifecycle It also supplies pharmaceutical secondary reference standards traceable to United States Pharmacopoeia and European Pharmacopoeia standards NSF wrote the only accredited American National Standard NSFANSI 173 that verifies the health and safety of dietary supplements and also tests and certifies products to this standard Additionally NSF offers ISO 13485 registration for medical devices and CE marking The NSF Consumer Products Division tests and certifies consumer products and appliances used in and around the home including home appliances cookware bakeware small kitchen electronics bottled water and beverages nutritional and dietary supplements private label goods and personal care products NSF Sustainability provides standards development certification and claims validation for sustainably produced commercial and consumer products such as personal care products carpet flooring fabrics and other building materials and process verification services such as greenhouse gas verification environmental footprinting and environmental management systems certifications NSF International Strategic Registrations NSFISR provides management systems certifications to internationally accepted standards for quality assurance and environmental protection for the automotive aerospace medical and manufacturing industries eg ISO 9001 ISO 14001 AS9100 etc NSF Education and Training provides training and education for professionals in the food safety water health sciences consumer product and management systems certification industries Laboratories NSF maintains laboratories in North America South America Europe and China NSFs laboratories are accredited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Standards Council of Canada NSF laboratories are ISO 17025 certified testing and calibration and provide a wide range of testing certification and technical services for the home appliances and consumer product industries eg beverage quality food service equipment nutritional supplement drinking water treatment units and automotive aftermarket parts retail food growers processors and seafood industries pipes plumbing components and treatment chemicals for the water industry and analytical testing for the supplement and pharmaceutical industry Standard development NSF is accredited by the American National Standards Institute to develop American National Standards NSF standards are developed maintained and revised by the committee ballot system similar to that used by American National Standards Institute ANSI and ASTM The committees consist of representatives of groups affected by the scope of the standard such as industry representatives public healthregulatory officials usersconsumer representatives and other relevant interest groups For instance for Standard 61 Drinking Water Systems Components Health Effects the committee consists of manufacturers of plumbing parts material manufacturers plastics metals etc toxicologists state regulatory officials etc Any updates to standards related to testing requirements are vetted through lab testing and balloting ensures majority rule References External links NSF International
