 Material flow analysis MFA also referred to as substance flow analysis SFA is an analytical method to quantify flows and stocks of materials or substances in a welldefined system MFA is an important tool to study the biophysical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales It is considered a core method of industrial ecology or anthropogenic urban social and industrial metabolism MFA is used to study material substance or product flows across different industrial sectors or within ecosystems MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation for example for tracking nutrient flows through a waste water treatment plant When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this businessoriented application of MFA is called Material Flow Cost Accounting MFA is an important tool to study the circular economy and to devise material flow management Since the 1990s the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily Peerreviewed journals that publish MFArelated work include the Journal of Industrial Ecology Ecological Economics Environmental Science and Technology and Resources Conservation and Recycling Methodology of MFA Motivation Human needs such as shelter food transport or communication require materials like wood starch sugar iron and steel copper or semiconductors As society develops and economic activity expands material production use and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be neglected anymore neither locally nor globally Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from landfills or oil spills Rising concern about global warming puts a previously unimportant waste flow carbon dioxide on top of the political and scientific agenda The gradual shift from primary material production to urban mining in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of inuse and obsolete stocks of materials within human society Scientists industries government bodies and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering staying within and leaving the different processes in the anthroposphere Material flow analysis is such a method Basic principles MFA is based on two fundamental and wellestablished scientific principles the systems approach and mass balance The system definition is the starting point of every MFA study System definition An MFA system is a model of an industrial plant an industrial sector or a region of concern The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study An MFA system always consists of the system boundary one or more processes material flows between processes and stocks of materials within processes Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary Contrary to chemical engineering where a system represents a specific industrial installation systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are welldefined The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes Next to specifying the arrangement of processes stocks and flows in the system definition the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied The spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA China certain world regions or the world as a whole The temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified The indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds As the name says an indicator element is a certain chemical element such as cadmium or a substance such as CO2 In general a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars materials like steel or other physical quantities such as energy MFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms material substance or good as laid out for example in chapter 21 of Brunner and Rechberger one of the main references for the MFA method A chemical element is a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom distinguished by its atomic number A substance is any chemical element or compound composed of uniform units All substances are characterised by a unique and identical constitution and are thus homogeneous From chapter 211 in BrunnerRechberger A good is defined as economic entity of matter with a positive or negative economic value Goods are made up of one or several substances From chapter 212 in Brunner and Rechberger The term material in MFA serves as an umbrella term for both substances and goods From chapter 213 in BrunnerRechberger Process balance One of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the metabolism of the elements of the system Unlike economic accounting MFA also covers noneconomic waste flows emissions to the environment and nonmarket natural resources The process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply For a process ‘oil refinery’ for example one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element while this is not possible for a nuclear power station A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel but a steel mill does not When quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process Conflicting information can be reconciled using data validation and reconciliation and the STANsoftware offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application Examples of MFA applications on different spatial and temporal scales MFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements substances and goods They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles Several examples MFA on a national or regional scale also referred to as material flow accounting In this type of study the material exchanges between an economy and the natural environment are analyzed Several indicators are calculated in order to assess the level of resource intensity of the system Corporate material flow analysis or MFA along an industrial supply chain involves a number of companies The goal of material flow analysis within a company is to quantify and then optimize the production processes so that materials and energy are used more efficiently manner eg by recycling and waste reduction Companies can use the results obtained by Material Flow Cost Accounting to reduce their operational costs and improve environmental performance In the life cycle of a product The life cycle inventory whose compilation is at the core of life cycle assessment follows the MFA methodology as it is based on an explicit system definition and process balances Historical development Mass balance or the conservation of matter has been postulated already in ancient Greece and it was introduced into modern chemistry by Antoine Lavoisier cf chapter 213 in BrunnerRechberger from where it found its way to chemical engineering and finally to environmental science Other seminal contributions were made by Sanctorius and Theodor Weyl Dennis Meadows made a wide audience aware of the physical foundation of the economy when he coauthored the bestseller Limits to Growth in 1971 Meadows et al based their predictions on an analysis of resource stocks see in the glossary of environmental science The methodology of MFA was developed during the 80s and 90s Development happened simultaneously in different research groups Central publications on the MFA methodology include Baccini and Bader 1996 Brunner and Rechberger 2004 Baccini and Brunner 2012 and van der Voet et al 2002 Friedrich SchmidtBleek who worked at the Wuppertal Institute developed the MFArelated concept of Material Input Per Service unit MIPS The UNEP Resource Panel was set up in 2007 by the United Nations Environment Program In analogy to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC it brings together experts from many disciplines and institutions to review the current state of research on societal metabolism and to communicate the latest findings to policymakers and stakeholders Recent development MFA concepts have been or are being incorporated in national accounts in several countries and regions such as the EU and Japan MFA is also used in the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting Several international conferences or other meetings provide a platform for researchers and policymakers to meet and exchange results and ideas including the World Resources Forum a biannual international conference on material flow analysis and sustainable development MFAIO is an approach to establish an MFA system of the whole economy using monetary and physical InputOutput tables The Sustainable Europe Research Institute SERI in Vienna Austria has developed a database called materialflowsnet Dynamic MFA aims for longterm quantification of MFA systems and uses historic development patterns of physical stocks and flows to create robust scenarios for the years and decades to come Japan has developed into a hotspot for MFA research The country has scarce mineral resources and therefore depends on imports of energy carriers ores and other raw materials The Japanese government fosters research on material cycles and also inaugurated the 3R concept Conducting a stateoftheart MFA A stateoftheart MFA consists of the following steps Establish an explicit system definition Specify the system boundary with geographical and temporal scope processes can contain stocks and flows Specify the material for which the system is to be quantified product substance or indicator element Make sure that each stock is associated with a process and that each flow connects one process to another Flows can also begin or end outside the system boundary Define and name the system variables The system variables include All stocks within the processes all flows between processes and all flows coming from outside or going to outside the system boundaries Sometimes stocks are not considered and only the net stock changes are of interest For each variable it must be clear whether it is a stock or a flow and this distinction needs to be reflected in the names and in the mathematical symbols chosen Quantify the system variables by linking them to literature measurement or modelled data Performa a mass balance check for all processes and the system as a whole Optional Visualise your system by using the boxandarrow scheme shown above or by using Sankey diagrams Document the MFA by reporting the explicit system definition along with the list of quantified system variables and the mass balance checks The difference between material and substance flow analysis While the term substance in substance flow analysis SFA always refers to chemical substances the term material in material flow analysis MFA has a much wider scope According to Brunner and Rechberger the term material comprises substances AND goods and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel timber or products like cars or buildings It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase Relation to other methods MFA is complementary to the other core industrial ecology methods life cycle assessment LCA and inputoutput IO models Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle The methods mainly differ in purpose scope and data requirements MFA studies often cover the entire cycle mining production manufacturing use waste handling of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame Material stocks are explicit in MFA which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap The common use of time series dynamic modelling and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing longterm trends in material use Compared to IO analyses the number of processes considered in MFA systems is usually much lower On the other hand mass balance ensures that flows of byproducts or waste are not overlooked in MFA studies whereas in IO tables these flows are often not included due to their lack of economic value Physical IO models are much less common than economic tables Material stocks are not covered by IO analysis only the addition to stock can be included in form of capital accumulation Life cycle inventories record the demand for many different materials associated with individual products whereas MFA studies typically focus on a single material used in many different products See also Business and economics portal Ecology portal Sociology portal Anthropogenic metabolism Energy accounting Industrial ecology Industrial
