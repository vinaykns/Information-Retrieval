 This article is about the plant genus For the principal modern crop species see Sorghum bicolor For other crop uses see Commercial sorghum For other uses see Sorghum disambiguation Sorgo redirects here For the Ragusan family see Sorgo family Sorghum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae Seventeen of the twentyfive species are native to Australia with the range of some extending to Africa Asia Mesoamerica and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans One species is grown for grain while many others are used as fodder plants either intentionally cultivated or allowed to grow naturally in pasture lands The plants are cultivated in warm climates worldwide and naturalized in many places Sorghum is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae the tribe of big bluestem and sugarcane Cultivation and uses One species Sorghum bicolor native to Africa with many cultivated forms now is an important crop worldwide used for food as grain and in sorghum syrup or sorghum molasses animal fodder the production of alcoholic beverages and biofuels Most varieties are drought and heattolerant and are especially important in arid regions where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people These varieties form important components of pastures in many tropical regions S bicolor is an important food crop in Africa Central America and South Asia and is the fifthmost important cereal crop grown in the world Some species of sorghum can contain levels of hydrogen cyanide hordenine and nitrates lethal to grazing animals in the early stages of the plants growth When stressed by drought or heat plants can also contain toxic levels of cyanide andor nitrates at later stages in growth Another Sorghum species Johnson grass S halapense is classified as an invasive species in the US by the Department of Agriculture Research Sorghum is efficient in converting solar energy to chemical energy and also uses less water compared to other grain crops Biofuel using sweet sorghum as a high sugar content from its stalk for ethanol production is being developed with biomass which can be turned into charcoal syngas and biooil Nutrition In a 100 gram amount raw sorghum provides 329 calories 72 carbohydrates 4 fat and 11 protein table Sorghum supplies numerous essential nutrients in rich content 20 or more of the Daily Value DV including protein fiber the B vitamins niacin thiamin and vitamin B6 and several dietary minerals including iron 26 DV and manganese 76 DV table Sorghum nutrient contents generally are similar to those of raw oats see nutrition table Among other similarities to oats sorghum contains no gluten making it useful for glutenfree diets Diversity Sorghum amplum – northwestern Australia Sorghum angustum –
