business with Veolia because of its involvement with illegal settlements Veolia denied wrongdoing Palestinian humanrights organization AlHaq instructed lawyers in the Netherlands to submit a formal objection against the decision of Stadsregio Arnhem Nijmegen a municipality to award a public transport concession to Hermes the Dutch subsidiary of Veolia Transdev The objection was based on Veolia’s involvement in what AlHaq claims are Israel’s violations of international law In a 2012 interview with the Israeli press Veolias Denis Gasquet senior executive vice president admitted that Veolia had been under pressure from proPalestinian groups in Europe particularly over the Jerusalem Light Rail Parties within Veolia had argued that the group was losing tenders as a result but Gasquest said he did not know of any tenders lost due to Veolias activities in Israel He confirmed Veolias intention to stay in Israel and occupied Palestine while exiting the transport business On April 1 2015 the company announced on its website Veolia closes the sale of its activities in Israel This was taken by supporters of the BDS Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement to signify a success for their

who refuses many such offers to fall foul of a provision in the Irish Social Welfare that allows benefits to be withdrawn from unemployed who repeatedly refuse work Flint water crisis Main article Flint water crisis On June 22 2016 Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette began its first civil action in the Flint water crisis by filing suit against Veolia North America and Lockwood Andrews Newnam LAN who were hired to consult Flint water plant officials after the switch to the Flint River in April 2015 The lawsuit accuses Veolia and LAN of professional negligence and public nuisance Veolia is also accused of fraud Veolia called the accusations baseless entirely unfounded and appears to be intended to distract from the troubling and disturbing realities that have emerged as a result of this tragedy And added In fact when Veolia raised potential lead and copper issues city officials and representatives told us to exclude it from our scope of work because the city and the EPA were just beginning to conduct lead and copper testing See also Paris portal Companies portal Distributed generation Veolia Transport Water privatization References External links Official website
