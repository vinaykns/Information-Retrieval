 George Joshua Richard Monbiot ˈmɒnbioʊ MONbeeoh born 27 January 1963 is a British writer known for his environmental and political activism He writes a weekly column for The Guardian and is the author of a number of books including Captive State The Corporate Takeover of Britain 2000 and Feral Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers of Rewilding 2013 He is the founder of The Land is Ours a peaceful campaign for the right of access to the countryside and its resources in the United Kingdom In January 2010 Monbiot founded the ArrestBlairorg website which offers a reward to people attempting a peaceful citizens arrest of former British prime minister Tony Blair for alleged crimes against peace Early life George Monbiot grew up in HenleyonThames in South Oxfordshire England in a house next to Peppard Common Politics was at the heart of family life—his father Raymond Geoffrey Monbiot is a businessman who headed the Conservative Partys trade and industry forum while his mother Rosalie—the elder daughter of Conservative MP Roger Gresham Cooke—was a Conservative councillor who led South Oxfordshire District Council for a decade His uncle Canon Hereward Cooke was the Liberal Democrat deputy leader of Norwich City Council between 2002 and 2006 Monbiot was educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire an independent school and won an open scholarship to Brasenose College Oxford He stated that his political awakening was prompted by reading Bettina Ehrlichs book Paolo and Panetto while at Stowe and that he regretted attending Oxford stating that his time there was unhappy and he did not fit in with the colleges culture Career After graduating in zoology Monbiot joined the BBC Natural History Unit as a radio producer making natural history and environmental programmes He transferred to the BBCs World Service where he worked briefly as a current affairs producer and presenter before leaving to research and write his first book Working as an investigative journalist he travelled in Indonesia Brazil and East Africa His activities led to his being made persona non grata in seven countries and being sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia in Indonesia In these places he was also shot at beaten up by military police shipwrecked and stung into a poisoned coma by hornets He came back to work in Britain after being pronounced clinically dead in Lodwar General Hospital in northwestern Kenya having contracted cerebral malaria In Britain he joined the roads protest movement and was often called to give press interviews as a result he was denounced as a media tart by groups such as Green Anarchist and Class War He was attacked by security guards who allegedly drove a metal spike through his foot smashing the middle metatarsal bone His injuries left him in hospital Sir Crispin Tickell a former British diplomat at the United Nations who was then Warden at Green College Oxford made the young protester a Visiting Fellow He was an active member of the Pure Genius campaign and cofounded The Land is Ours which has occupied land at several locations in Britain Its first highprofile success was in 1997 when it occupied thirteen acres five hectares of prime real estate on the river in London on which its owner beverages multinational Diageo intended to build a superstore The protesters defeated Diageo in court built an ecovillage and held on to the land for six months Among his bestknown articles are his critique of David Bellamys climate science his description of an encounter with a police torturer in Brazil his attack on libertarian interpretations of genetics his discussion of the ethics of outsourcing and his attack on the politics of Bob Geldof and Bono In January 2011 Monbiot took the unusual step of publishing an account of his assets In the interests of transparency Monbiot explained that he earned £77400 a year gross from publishing contracts and rents and urged other journalists to follow suit He continues to publish his financial accounts on his website He has held visiting fellowships or professorships at the universities of Oxford environmental policy Bristol philosophy Keele politics Oxford Brookes planning and East London environmental science Monbiot lived in Oxford for many years but in 2007 moved with his thenwife writer and campaigner Angharad Penrhyn Jones and daughter to a low emissions house in the midWales market town of Machynlleth Monbiots second daughter was born in the spring of 2012 Because his new partner lives in Oxford Monbiot had returned there by 2013 In November 2012 he apologised to Lord McAlpine for his stupidity and thoughtlessness in implying in a tweet that the Tory peer was a paedophile In March 2013 Monbiot announced on his blog the details of a settlement reached with Lord McAlpines representatives Monbiot agreed to carry out over the next three years work on behalf of three charities of my choice whose value amounts to £25000 which he described as an unprecedented settlement Activism Climate change Monbiot believes that drastic action coupled with strong political will is needed to combat global warming Monbiot has written that climate change is the moral question of the 21st century and that there is an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change including setting targets on greenhouse emissions using the latest science issuing every citizen with a personal carbon ration new building regulations with houses built to German passivhaus standards banning incandescent light bulbs patio heaters garden floodlights and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications constructing large offshore wind farms replacing the national gas grid with a hydrogen pipe network a new national coach network to make journeys using public transport faster than using a car all petrol stations to supply leasable electric car batteries with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries scrap roadbuilding and roadwidening programmes redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change reduce UK airport capacity by 90 percent closing down all outoftown superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system Monbiot says the campaign against climate change is unlike almost all the public protests that came before it It is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity It is a campaign not for more freedom but for less Strangest of all it is a campaign not just against other people but against ourselves Monbiot also thinks that economic recession can be a good thing for the planet Is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land and should seek to stay there Why would we want to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse Surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible While he does recognize that recession can cause hardship he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well For example the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution Monbiot purchased a used diesel Renault Clio after moving to Machynlleth in 2007 He has travelled through Canada and the United States campaigning on climate change and promoting his book He contends that this travel was justifiable as it sought to boost the case for much greater carbon cuts there He is the patron of the UK student campaign network People Planet and appears in the film The Age of Stupid in animated form in which he says The very fact that the crisis is taking place within our generation its happening right now means that we are tremendously powerful people So this position of despair and I cant do anything and theres no point is completely illogical its exactly the opposite Monbiot attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Copenhagen Monbiot once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011 Although he still loathes the liars who run the nuclear industry Monbiot now advocates its use having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the 2011 Japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in the region Subsequently he has harshly condemned the antinuclear movement writing that it has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human healthmade claims ungrounded in science unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong He singled out Helen Caldicott for he wrote making unsourced and inaccurate claims dismissing contrary evidence as part of a coverup and overstating the death toll from the Chernobyl disaster by a factor of more than 140 In October 2013 Monbiot criticized the selection of a generation III reactor design for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station due to cost as well as for a half century requirement of uranium mining and transuranic waste production He contrasted this with two generation IV reactor concepts if integral fast reactors were deployed the UKs stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough lowcarbon energy to meet all UK demand for 500 years These reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained solving three huge problems—energy supply nuclear waste and climate change—at once Thorium reactors use an element thats already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries They recycle their own waste leaving almost nothing behind cf similar comments by James Hansen In 2012 Monbiot claimed that there was more than enough oil for industry and consumer capitalism to deepfry the lot of us citing a report of 110 million barrels per day in 2020 Debate with Ian Plimer Monbiot harshly criticised the book Heaven and Earth by climate change skeptic Ian Plimer saying that Since its publication in Australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors and its fudging and manipulation of the data Plimer challenged Monbiot to a public debate on the issues covered in the book Monbiot agreed on the condition that Plimer first answer a series of written questions for publication on the website of The Guardian so there would be a factual basis to the discussion Plimer refused and Monbiot labeled Plimer a grandstander with a broad yellow streak who has nowhere answered the accusations of serious errors in his Heaven and Earth book and accused him of trying to drown out the precise refutations published by his books reviewers Plimer then reversed his decision and agreed to answer written questions in return for a live debate Monbiots response on receiving Plimers contribution was one of disappointment on the grounds that Plimers response so far consists not of answers but of questions addressed to me Monbiot told Plimer that he is not qualified to answer Plimers questions although Gavin Schmidt of NASA did answer them On 2 September 2009 Monbiot published another column in The Guardian asking Is Ian Plimer ever going to answer my questions and suggested that Plimer was evading the questions by using the Chewbacca defence A debate was subsequently held on 15 December while Monbiot was in Copenhagen on the Australian Broadcasting Corporations Lateline programme moderated by Tony Jones Attempted arrest of John Bolton Monbiot made an unsuccessful attempt to carry out a citizens arrest of John Bolton a former US ambassador to the United Nations when the latter attended the Hay Festival to give a talk on international relations in May 2008 Monbiot argued that Bolton was one of the instigators of the Iraq War of which Monbiot was an opponent Political parties He was involved initially with the Respect political party but he broke with the organisation when it chose to run candidates against the Green Party in the 2004 election to the European Parliament In an interview with the British political blog Third Estate in September 2009 Monbiot expressed his support for the policies of Plaid Cymru saying I have finally found the party that I feel very comfortable with Thats not to say I feel uncomfortable with the Green Party on the whole I support it but I feel even more comfortable with Plaid In April 2010 he was a signatory to an open letter of support for the Liberal Democrats published in The Guardian Prior to the 2015 UK general election he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Partys Caroline Lucas Indigenous rights Monbiot has been associated with the cause of indigenous rights and has sought to denounce threats to tribal people at the face of corporate interests He contributed to the 2009 book We Are One A Celebration of Tribal Peoples which explores the culture of peoples around the world portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces Published works Monbiots first book was Poisoned Arrows 1989 a work of investigative travel journalism exposing what he called the devastating effects of the partially World Bankfunded transmigration program on the peoples and tribes of Papua and West Papua in Indonesia It was followed by Amazon Watershed 1991 which documented expulsions of Brazilian peasant farmers from their land and followed them thousands of miles across the forest to the territory of the Yanomami Indians and showed how timber sold in Britain was being stolen from indigenous and biological reserves in Brazil His third book No Mans Land An Investigative Journey Through Kenya and Tanzania 1994 documented the seizure of land and cattle from nomadic people in Kenya and the Tanzania by—among other forces—game parks and safari tourism In 2000 he published Captive State The Corporate Takeover of Britain The book examines the role of corporate power in the United Kingdom on both local and national levels and argues that corporate involvement in politics is a serious threat to democracy Subjects discussed in the book include the building of the Skye Bridge corporate involvement in the National Health Service the role of business in university research and the conditions which influence the granting of planning permission The Age of Consent His fifth book The Age of Consent A Manifesto for a New World Order was published in 2003 The book is an attempt to set out a positive manifesto for change for the global justice movement Monbiot criticises anarchism and Marxism arguing that any possible solution to the worlds inequalities must be rooted in a democratic parliamentary system The four main changes to global governance which Monbiot argues for are a democratically elected world parliament which would pass resolutions on international issues a democratised United Nations General Assembly to replace the unelected UN Security Council the proposed International Clearing Union which would automatically discharge trade deficits and prevent the accumulation of debt and a fair trade organisation which would regulate world trade in a way that protects the economies of poorer countries The book also discusses ways in which these ideas may be put into practice He posits that the United States and Western European states are heavily dependent on the existence of this debt and that when faced with a choice between releasing the developing world from debt and the collapse of the global economy their internal economic interests will dictate that they opt for the soft landing option However Monbiot emphasises that he does not present the manifesto as a final or definitive answer to global inequalities but intends that it should open debate and stresses that those who reject it must offer their own solutions He argues that ultimately the global justice movement must seekto provide a coherent programme of alternatives to the concentrated power of the dictatorship of vested interests Heat Monbiots next book Heat How to Stop the Planet Burning published in 2006 focuses on the issue of climate change He points out that the public opinion campaign to cast doubt on the reality of climate change is funded by fossilfuel companies primarily ExxonMobil and traces the network of fake citizens groups and bogus scientific bodies campaigning to discredit climate science to origins in a campaign by tobacco companies to create a facade of science to cast doubt on the link between cigarette smoking and disease He argues that a 90 percent reduction in carbon emissions is necessary in developed countries in order to prevent disastrous changes to the climate He then sets out to demonstrate how such a reduction could be achieved within the United Kingdom without a significant fall in living standards through changes in housing power supply and transport Feral Feral Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers of Rewilding was published in 2013 and focuses on the concept of rewilding the planet Monbiot states rewilding offers a positive environmentalism Environmentalists have long known what they are against now we can explain what we are for In the book Monbiot attacks sheep farming as a slowburning ecological disaster which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution Yet scarcely anyone seems to have noticed He particularly looks at sheep farming in Wales The book received favourable reviews including in publications normally hostile to his work such as The Spectator and The Daily Telegraph It won the Society of Biology Book Award for general biology in 2014 Honours He has honorary doctorates from the University of St Andrews and the University of Essex and an honorary fellowship from Cardiff University In 1995 Nelson Mandela presented him with a United Nations Global 500 Award for outstanding environmental achievement He was a finalist in the Lloyds National Screenwriting Prize with his screenplay The Norwegian and won a Sony Award for radio production the Sir Peter Kent Award and the OneWorld National Press Award In November 2007 his book Heat was awarded the Premio Mazotti an Italian book prize but he was denied the money given with the prize because he refused to travel to Venice to collect it in person arguing that it was not a good enough reason to justify flying Bibliography Poisoned Arrows An investigative journey through the forbidden lands of West Papua 1989 Abacus ISBN 0718131533 Amazon
