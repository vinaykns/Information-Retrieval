 Conservation is an ethic of resource use allocation and protection Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the natural world its fisheries habitats and biological diversity Secondary focus is on materials conservation including nonrenewable resources such as metals minerals and fossil fuels and energy conservation which is important to protect the natural world Those who follow the conservation ethic and especially those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed conservationists The terms conservation and preservation are frequently conflated outside of the academic scientific and professional literatures The US National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics ″Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing Both terms involve a degree of protection but how that is protection is carried out is the key difference Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings objects and landscapes Put simply conservation seeks the proper use of nature while preservation seeks protection of nature from use During the environmental movement of the early 20th century two opposing factions emerged conservationists and preservationists Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether″ Introduction To conserve habitat in terrestrial ecoregions and to stop deforestation is a goal widely shared by many groups with a wide variety of motivations To protect sea life from extinction due to overfishing or climate change is another commonly stated goal of conservation — ensuring that some will be available for future generations to continue a way of life The consumer conservation ethic is sometimes expressed by the four Rs Rethink Reduce Recycle Repair This social ethic primarily relates to local purchasing moral purchasing the sustained and efficient use of renewable resources the moderation of destructive use of finite resources and the prevention of harm to common resources such as air and water quality the natural functions of a living earth and cultural values in a built environment The principal value underlying most expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value — a view carried forward by the scientific conservation movement and some of the older Romantic schools of ecology movement More Utilitarian schools of conservation seek a proper valuation of local and global impacts of human activity upon nature in their effect upon human well being now and to posterity How such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social political and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced This is a view common in the modern environmental movement These movements have diverged but they have deep and common roots in the conservation movement In the United States of America the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America The posthumous publication of Henry David Thoreaus Walden established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man From George Perkins Marsh a very different book Man and Nature later subtitled The Earth as Modified by Human Action catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives Terminology The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem Unless we solve that problem it will avail us little to solve all others Theodore Roosevelt In common usage the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests including biological diversity Carl F Jordan defines the term as biological conservation as being a philosophy of managing the environment in a manner that does not despoil exhaust or extinguish While this usage is not new the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of ecology biogeography anthropology economy and sociology to maintain biodiversity The term conservation itself may cover the concepts such as cultural diversity genetic diversity and the concept of movements environmental conservation seedbank preservation of seeds These are often summarized as the priority to respect diversity especially by Greens Much recent movement in conservation can be considered a resistance to commercialism and globalization Slow food is a consequence of rejecting these as moral priorities and embracing a slower and more locally focused lifestyle Practice Distinct trends exist regarding conservation development While many countries efforts to preserve species and their habitats have been governmentled those in the North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middleclass and aristocratic interest in natural history expressed at the level of the individual and the national regional or local learned society Thus countries like Britain the Netherlands Germany etc had what we would today term NGOs — in the shape of the RSPB National Trust and County Naturalists Trusts dating back to 1889 1895 and 1912 respectively Natuurmonumenten Provincial conservation Trusts for each Dutch province Vogelbescherming etc — a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe as well as a longstanding interest in laissezfaire government in some countries like the UK leaving it as no coincidence that John Muir the Scottishborn founder of the National Park movement and hence of governmentsponsored conservation did his sterling work in the USA where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone Nowadays officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other and in practice private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status Protected areas in developing countries where probably as many as 70–80 percent of the species of the world live still enjoy very little effective management and protection Some countries such as Mexico have nonprofit civil organizations and land owners dedicated to protect vast private property such is the case of Hacienda Chichens Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge in Chichen Itza Yucatán The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50 short This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105000 rangers in the developing and transition countries One of the worlds foremost conservationists Dr Kenton Miller stated about the importance of rangers The future of our ecosystem services and our heritage depends upon park rangers With the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing there has never been more of a need for well prepared human capacity to manage Park rangers are the backbone of park management They are on the ground They work on the front line with scientists visitors and members of local communities Adopt A Ranger fears that the ranger deficit is the greatest single limiting factor in effectively conserving nature in 75 of the world Currently no conservation organization or western country or international organization addresses this problem Adopt A Ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries protected areas without field staff Very specifically it will contribute to solving the problem by fund raising to finance rangers in the field It will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies Others including Survival International have advocated instead for cooperation with local tribal peoples who are natural allies of the conservation movement and can provide
