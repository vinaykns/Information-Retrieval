The City of Santa Clara electric department was founded in 1896 when it installed 46 streetlights powered by a direct current generator In January 1904 to 1965 the electric department began purchasing energy for resale to Santa Clara’s customers from the United Gas and Electric Company of San Jose which later became part of Pacific Gas and Electric Company PGE PGE supplied Santa Clara’s electric needs until 1965 when the electric department began to purchase its power from the Central Valley Project CVP supervised by the United States Bureau of Reclamation In 1968 Santa Clara became a founding member of the Northern California Power Agency NCPA in order to work with other municipal electric utilities to jointly develop costeffective energy sources In 1980 the Santa Clara electric department became an energy producing utility for the first time since 1903 when it launched its own 6megawatt MW cogeneration project the first of three natural gasfueled electricity generation plants in the City of Santa Clara In 1983 Santa Clara and its NCPA partners became the first cities in the US to invest in and operate a publicly owned geothermal plant the 110 MW NCPA Geothermal Project one of 22 geothermal power plants at The Geysers with Santa Clara having a 55 ownership interest In 1998 the Santa Clara electric department was renamed Silicon Valley Power SVP Subsequent efforts to expand and diversify its electricity supply led to construction of the Donald Von Raesfeld combined cycle natural gas plant 2005 various partnerships in wind and hydroelectric generation sources and 25 percent ownership of the Lodi Energy Center combined cycle natural gas plant 2012 In 2007 SVP launched Santa Clara Green Power to provide residents and businesses the option to use only renewable energy SVP continually pursues affordable renewable power options as the city general plan states an objective to be sustainable On average in 2012 over 38 percent of the electricity
