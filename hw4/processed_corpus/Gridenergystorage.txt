 Grid storage redirects here For data storage with grid computing see Gridoriented storage Grid energy storage also called largescale energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on a large scale within an electrical power grid Electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power tidal power solar power exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption As of 2016 by far the largest form of grid energy storage on grids is dammed hydroelectricity with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage An alternative to grid storage is the use of peaking power plants to fill in Benefits of storage and managing peak load The stores are used feeding power to the grids at times when consumption that cannot be deferred or delayed exceeds production In this way electricity production need not be drastically scaled up and down to meet momentary consumption – instead transmission from the combination of generators plus storage facilities is maintained at a more constant level An alternate and complementary approach to achieve the same effect as grid energy storage is to use a smart grid communication infrastructure to enable Demand response DR Both of these technologies shift energy usage and transmission of power on the grid from one time when its not useful to another when its desperately immediately needed Any electrical power grid must adapt energy production to energy consumption both of which vary drastically over time Any combination of energy storage and demand response has these advantages fuelbased power plants ie coal oil gas nuclear can be more efficiently and easily operated at constant production levels electricity generated by or with the potential to be generated by intermittent sources can be stored and used later whereas it would otherwise have to be transmitted for sale elsewhere or simply wasted peak generating or transmission capacity can be reduced by the total potential of all storage plus deferrable loads see demand side management saving the expense of this capacity more stable pricing the cost of the storage andor demand management is included in pricing so there is less variation in power rates charged to customers or alternatively if rates are kept stable by law less loss to the utility from expensive onpeak wholesale power rates when peak demand must be met by imported wholesale power emergency preparedness—vital needs can be met reliably even with no transmission or generation going on while nonessential needs are deferred Energy derived from photovoltaic tidal and wind sources inherently varies  – the amount of electrical energy produced varies with time of day moon phase season and random factors such as the weather Thus renewables present special challenges to electric utilities While hooking up many separate wind sources can reduce the overall variability solar is reliably not available at night except when stored in molten salt and tidal power shifts with the moon so it is never reliably available on peak demand How much this affects any given utility varies significantly In a summer peak utility more solar can generally be absorbed and matched to demand In winter peak utilities to a lesser degree wind correlates to heating demand and can be used to meet that demand Depending on these factors beyond about 2040 of total generation gridconnected intermittent energy sources such as photovoltaics and wind turbines tend to require investment in either grid energy storage or demand side management or both In an electrical power grid without energy storage energy sources that rely on energy stored within fuels coal oil gas nuclear must be scaled up and down to match the rise and fall of energy production from intermittent energy sources see load following power plant While oil and gas plants can be scaled up when wind dies down quickly coal and nuclear plants take considerable time to respond to load Utilities with less gas or oil power generation are thus more reliant on demand management and grid storage The French consulting firm Yole Développement figures this “stationary storage” market could be a 135 billion opportunity by 2023 compared with less than 1 billion in 2015 Demand side management and grid storage The demand side can also store energy from the grid for example charging a battery electric vehicle stores energy for a vehicle and storage heaters district heating storage or ice storage provide thermal storage for buildings At present this storage serves only to shift consumption to the offpeak time of day no energy is returned to the grid The need for grid storage to provide peak power is reduced by demand side time of use pricing one of the benefits of smart meters At the household level consumers may choose less expensive offpeak times for clothes washerdryers dishwashers showers and cooking As well commercial and industrial users will take advantage of cost savings by deferring some processes to offpeak times Regional impacts from the unpredictable operation of wind power has created a new need for interactive demand response where the utility communicates with the demand Historically this was only done in cooperation with large industrial consumers but now may be expanded to entire grids For instance a few large scale projects in Europe link variations in wind power to change industrial food freezer loads causing small variations in temperature If communicated on a gridwide scale small changes to heatingcooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid Whether or not to consider moredeeplyfrozen food or moreheated water a form of energy storage is debatable A report released in December 2013 by the United States Department of Energy further describes the potential benefits of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid “Modernizing the electric system will help the nation meet the challenge of handling projected energy needs—including addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from nonrenewable energy processes Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system and energy storage can play a significant role in meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid lowering cost and ensuring high reliability as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments Finally energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services” The report was written by a core group of developers representing Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability ARPAE Office of Science Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Sandia National Laboratories and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage Forms Air Compressed air Main article Compressed air energy storage Another grid energy storage method is to use offpeak or renewably generated electricity to compress air which is usually stored in an old mine or some other kind of geological feature When electricity demand is high the compressed air is heated with a small amount of natural gas and then goes through turboexpanders to generate electricity Compressed air storage is typically around 60 90 efficient Liquid air Main articles Liquid air and Cryogenic energy storage Another electricity storage method is to compress and cool air turning it into liquid air which can be stored and expanded when needed turning a turbine generating electricity with a storage efficiency of up to 70 Batteries Main articles Battery electricity Rechargeable battery and Battery storage power station Battery storage was used in the early days of direct current electric power Where AC grid power was not readily available isolated lighting plants run by wind turbines or internal combustion engines provided lighting and power to small motors The battery system could be used to run the load without starting the engine or when the wind was calm A bank of leadacid batteries in glass jars both supplied power to illuminate lamps as well as to start an engine to recharge the batteries Battery systems connected to large solidstate converters have been used to stabilize power distribution networks For example in Puerto Rico a system with a capacity of 20 megawatts for 15 minutes 5 megawatt hour stabilizes the frequency of electric power produced on the island A 27 megawatt 15minute 675 megawatt hour nickelcadmium battery bank was installed at Fairbanks Alaska in 2003 to stabilize voltage at the end of a long transmission line Many offthegrid domestic systems rely on battery storage see Battery storage power station Other possible largescale storage technologies include flow liquid metal and sodiumIon batteries Sodiumsulfur batteries could also be inexpensive to implement on a large scale and have been used for grid storage in Japan and in the United States Magnesiumantimony batteries are under development In 2016 a zincion battery was proposed for use in grid storage applications In 2017 the California Public Utilities Commission installed 396 refrigeratorsized stacks of Tesla batteries at the Mira Loma substation in Ontario California that are capable of powering 15000 homes for over four hours Flow batteries Rechargeable flow batteries can be used as a rapidresponse storage medium Vanadium redox batteries is another flow battery They are installed at Huxley Hill wind farm Australia Tomari Wind Hills at Hokkaidō Japan as well as in nonwind farm applications A 12 MW·h flow battery was to be installed at the Sorne Hill wind farm Ireland These storage systems are designed to smooth out transient wind fluctuations Hydrogen Bromide has been proposed for use in a utilityscale flowtype battery BYD proposes to use conventional consumer battery technologies such as lithium iron phosphate LiFePO4 battery connecting many batteries in parallel Some grid batteries are colocated with renewable energy plants either to smooth the power supplied by the intermittent wind or solar output or to shift the power output into other hours of the day when the renewable plant cannot produce power directly see Installation examples The largest grid storage batteries in the United States include the 315MW battery at Grand Ridge Power plant in Illinois and the 315 MW battery at Beech Ridge West Virginia Two batteries under construction in 2015 include the 400MWh 100MW for 4 hours Southern California Edison project and the 52 MWh project on Kauai Hawaii to entirely time shift a 13MW solar farms output to the evening Two batteries are in Fairbanks Alaska 40 MW for 7 minutes using NiCd cells and in Notrees Texas 36 MW for 40 minutes using leadacid batteries A 13 MWh battery made of worn batteries from electric cars is being constructed in Germany with an expected second life of 10 years In 2015 a 221 MW battery storage was installed in the USA with total capacity expected to reach 17 GW in 2020 Battery storage technology is typically around 50 85 efficient Electric vehicles Main article Electric vehicle Companies are researching the possible use of electric vehicles to meet peak demand A parked and pluggedin electric vehicle could sell the electricity from the battery during peak loads and charge either during night at home or during offpeak Plugin hybrid or electric cars could be used for their energy storage capabilities Vehicletogrid technology can be employed turning each vehicle with its 20 to 50 kWh battery pack into a distributed loadbalancing device or emergency power source This represents 2 to 5 days per vehicle of average household requirements of 10 kWh per day assuming annual consumption of 3650 kWh This quantity of energy is equivalent to between 40 and 300 miles 64 and 483 km of range in such vehicles consuming 05 to 016 kWh per mile These figures can be achieved even in homemade electric vehicle conversions Some electric utilities plan to use old plugin vehicle batteries sometimes resulting in a giant battery to store electricity However a large disadvantage of using vehicle to grid energy storage is the fact that each storage cycle stresses the battery with one complete chargedischarge cycle Conventional cobaltbased lithium ion batteries break down with the number of cycles newer liion batteries do not break down significantly with each cycle and so have much longer lives One approach is to reuse unreliable vehicle batteries in dedicated grid storage 3 as they are expected to be good in this role for ten years 4 If such storage is done on a large scale it becomes much easier to guarantee replacement of a vehicle battery degraded in mobile use as the old battery has value and immediate use Flywheel Main articles Flywheel storage power system and Flywheel energy storage Mechanical inertia is the basis of this storage method When the electric power flows into the device an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed slowing down the disc and producing electricity Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings tending to make the method expensive Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic however tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application they are probably best suited to loadleveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland Applications that use flywheel storage are those that require very high bursts of power for very short durations such as tokamak and laser experiments where a motor generator is spun up to operating speed and is partially slowed down during discharge Flywheel storage is also currently used in the form of the Diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply to provide uninterruptible power supply systems such as those in large datacenters for ridethrough power necessary during transfer – that is the relatively brief amount of time between a loss of power to the mains and the warmup of an alternate source such as a diesel generator This potential solution has been implemented by EDA in the Azores on the islands of Graciosa and Flores This system uses an 18 megawattsecond flywheel to improve power quality and thus allow increased renewable energy usage As the description suggests these systems are again designed to smooth out transient fluctuations in supply and could never be used to cope with an outage exceeding a couple of days Powercorp in Australia have been developing applications using wind turbines flywheels and low load diesel LLD technology to maximise the wind input to small grids A system installed in Coral Bay Western Australia uses wind turbines coupled with a flywheel based control system and LLDs to achieve better than 60 wind contribution to the town grid Hydrogen Main articles Hydrogen economy and Hydrogen storage Hydrogen is being developed as an electrical energy storage medium Hydrogen is produced then compressed or liquefied cryogenicly stored at −252882 °C and then converted back to electrical energy or heat Hydrogen can be used as a fuel for portable vehicles or stationary energy generation Compared to pumped water storage and batteries hydrogen has the advantage that it is a high energy density fuel Hydrogen can be produced either by reforming natural gas with steam or by the electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen see hydrogen production Reforming natural gas produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct High temperature electrolysis and high pressure electrolysis are two techniques by which the efficiency of hydrogen production may be able to be increased Hydrogen is then converted back to electricity in an internal combustion engine or a fuel cell The ACtoAC efficiency of hydrogen storage has been shown to be on the order of 20 to 45 which imposes economic constraints The price ratio between purchase and sale of electricity must be at least proportional to the efficiency in order for the system to be economic Hydrogen fuel cells can respond quickly enough to correct rapid fluctuations in electricity demand or supply and regulate frequency Whether hydrogen can use natural gas infrastructure depends on the network construction materials standards in joints and storage pressure The equipment necessary for hydrogen energy storage includes an electrolysis plant hydrogen compressors or liquifiers and storage tanks Biohydrogen is a process being investigated for producing hydrogen using biomass Micro combined heat and power microCHP can use hydrogen as a fuel Some nuclear power plants may be able to benefit from a symbiosis with hydrogen production High temperature 950 to 1000 °C gas cooled nuclear generation IV reactors have the potential to electrolyze hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat as in the sulfuriodine cycle The first commercial reactors are expected in 2030 A community based pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators was started in 2007 in the remote community of Ramea Newfoundland and Labrador A similar project has been going on since 2004 in Utsira a small Norwegian island municipality Underground hydrogen storage Underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground caverns salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by Imperial Chemical Industries ICI for many years without any difficulties The European project Hyunder indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it cant be covered by PHES and CAES systems Power to gas Power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel There are 2 methods the first is to use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid The second less efficient method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane see natural gas using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada Pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen Before switching to natural gas the German gas networks were operated using towngas which for the most part consisted of hydrogen The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement By comparison the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss 01 than in a power network 8 The use of the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy The powertoammonia concept The powertoammonia concept offers a carbonfree energy storage route with a diversified application palette At times when there is a surplus of renewable electricity it can be converted to ammonia locally using smallscale plants Existing technology can be used to produce ammonia by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with the help of electricity then using high temperature and pressure to convert the hydrogen plus nitrogen from the air into ammonia Ammonia is similar to propane when stored in liquid form unlike Hydrogen which is difficult to liquefy and store cryogenicly at −252882 °C Just like natural gas the produced and stored ammonia can be used by energy companies at any time as fuel for electricity generation Ammonia can be stored as a liquid a standard tank of 60000 m3 contains about 211 GWh of energy equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines on land Ammonia can be burned cleanly water and nitrogen are released but no CO2 and little or no nitrogen oxides Ammonia can be further used as a flexible chemical as a fertilizer chemical commodity deNOx agent and energy carrier Given this flexibility of usage and given the fact that the supporting infrastructure for the transport distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a largescale noncarbon energy carrier of the future Hydroelectricity Pumped water Main article Pumpedstorage hydroelectricity In 2008 world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 GW while other sources claim 127 GW which comprises the vast majority of all types of grid electric storage all other types combined are some hundreds of MW In many places pumped storage hydroelectricity is used to even out the daily generating load by pumping water to a high storage reservoir during offpeak hours and weekends using the excess baseload capacity from coal or nuclear sources During peak hours this water can be used for hydroelectric generation often as a high value rapidresponse reserve to cover transient peaks in demand Pumped storage recovers about 70 to 85 of the energy consumed and is currently the most cost effective form of mass power storage The chief problem with pumped storage is that it usually requires two nearby reservoirs at considerably different heights and often requires considerable capital expenditure Pumped water systems have high dispatchability meaning they can come online very quickly typically within 15 seconds which makes these systems very efficient at soaking up variability in electrical demand from consumers There is over 90 GW of pumped storage in operation around the world which is about 3 of instantaneous global generation capacity Pumped water storage systems such as the Dinorwig storage system in Britain hold five or six hours of generating capacity and are used to smooth out demand variations Another example is the Tianhuangping PumpedStorage Hydro Plant in China which has a reservoir capacity of eight million cubic meters 21 billion US gallons or the volume of water over Niagara Falls in 25 minutes with a vertical distance of 600 m 1970 feet The reservoir can provide about 13 GW·h of stored gravitational potential energy convertible to electricity at about 80 efficiency or about 2 of Chinas daily electricity consumption A new concept in pumpedstorage is utilizing wind energy or solar power to pump water Wind turbines or solar cells that direct drive water pumps for an energy storing wind or solar dam can make this a more efficient process but are limited Such systems can only increase kinetic water volume during windy and daylight periods Hydroelectric dams Hydroelectric dams with large reservoirs can also be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released through the plant when demand is higher The net effect is the same as pumped storage but without the pumping loss Depending on the reservoir capacity the plant can provide daily weekly or seasonal load following Many existing hydroelectric dams are fairly old for example the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of 69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam compared to more than 400 per kilowatt for oilfired peaking generators While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way the uprated dam is one of the most efficient forms of energy storage because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir only increased losses to evaporation and leakage A dam which impounds a large reservoir can store and release a correspondingly large amount of energy by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters Limitations do apply to dam operation their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers For example there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night dams are still required to release enough water to maintain adequate river levels whether electricity is generated or not Conversely theres a limit to peak capacity which if excessive could cause a river to flood for a few hours each day Superconducting magnetic energy Main article Superconducting magnetic energy storage Superconducting magnetic energy storage SMES systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature A typical SMES system includes three parts superconducting coil power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator Once the superconducting coil is charged the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil The power conditioning system uses an inverterrectifier to transform alternating current AC power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power The inverterrectifier accounts for about 2–3 energy loss in each direction SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy SMES systems are highly efficient the roundtrip efficiency is greater than 95 The high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy storage method Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the limits in the total energy able to be stored SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage Therefore SMES is most commonly devoted to improving power quality If SMES were to be used for utilities it would be a diurnal storage device charged from base load power at night and meeting peak loads during the day Superconducting magnetic energy storage technical challenges are yet to be solved for it to become practical Thermal Main article Thermal energy storage In Denmark the direct storage of electricity is perceived as too expensive for very large scale usage albeit significant usage is made of existing Norwegian Hydro Instead the use of existing hot water storage tanks connected to district heating schemes heated by either electrode boilers or heat pumps is seen as a preferable approach The stored heat is then transmitted to dwellings using district heating pipes Molten salt is used to store heat collected by a solar power tower so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night Offpeak electricity can be used to make ice from water and the ice can be stored The stored ice can be used to cool the air in a large building which would have normally used electric AC thereby shifting the electric load to offpeak hours On other systems stored ice is used to cool the intake air of a gas turbine generator thus increasing the onpeak generation capacity and the onpeak efficiency A Pumped Heat Electricity Storage system uses a highly reversible heat engineheat pump to pump heat between two storage vessels heating one and cooling the other The UKbased engineering company Isentropic that is developing the system claims a potential electricityin to electricityout roundtrip efficiency of 7280 Gravitational potential energy storage with solid masses According to Scientific American ski lifts and trains tracks are among places being considered to store energy by moving heavy objects up or down inclines Economics The levelized cost of storing electricity depends highly on storage type and purpose as subsecondscale frequency regulation minutehourscale peaker plants or dayweekscale season storage Using battery storage is said to be U012017 per kWh Generally speaking energy storage is economical when the marginal cost of electricity varies more than the costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process For instance assume a pumpedstorage reservoir can pump to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1200 MW·h after all losses are factored in evaporation and seeping in the reservoir efficiency losses etc If the marginal cost of electricity during offpeak times is 15 per MW·h and the reservoir operates at 75 efficiency ie 1600 MW·h are consumed and 1200 MW·h of energy are retrieved then the total cost of filling the reservoir is 24000 If all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average 40 per MW·h then the reservoir will see revenues of 48000 for the day for a gross profit of 24000 However the marginal cost of electricity varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators At one extreme base load power plants such as coalfired power plants and nuclear power plants are low marginal cost generators as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs At the other extreme peaking power plants such as gas turbine natural gas plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build operate and maintain To minimize the total operational cost of generating power base load generators are dispatched most of the time while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary generally when energy demand peaks This is called economic dispatch Demand for electricity from the worlds various grids varies over the course of the day and from season to season For the most part variation in electric demand is met by varying the amount of electrical energy supplied from primary sources Increasingly however operators are storing lowercost energy produced at night then releasing it to the grid during the peak periods of the day when it is more valuable In areas where hydroelectric dams exist release can be delayed until demand is greater this form of storage is common and can make use of existing reservoirs This is not storing surplus energy produced elsewhere but the net effect is the same although without the efficiency losses Renewable supplies with variable production like wind and solar power tend to increase the net variation in electric load increasing the opportunity for grid energy storage It may be more economical to find an alternative market for unused electricity rather than try and store it High Voltage Direct Current allows for transmission of electricity losing only 3 per 1000 km The United States Department of Energys International Energy Storage Database provides a free list of grid energy storage projects many of which show funding sources and amounts Load leveling The demand for electricity from consumers and industry is constantly changing broadly within the following categories Seasonal during dark winters more electric lighting and heating is required while in other climates hot weather boosts the requirement for air conditioning Weekly most industry closes at the weekend lowering demand Daily such as the morning peak as offices open and air conditioners get switched on Hourly one method for estimating television viewing figures in the United Kingdom is to measure the power spikes during advertisement breaks or after programmes when viewers go to switch a kettle on Transient fluctuations due to individuals actions differences in power transmission efficiency and other small factors that need to be accounted for There are currently three main methods for dealing with changing demand Electrical devices generally having a working voltage range that they require commonly 110–120 V or 220–240 V Minor variations in load are automatically smoothed by slight variations in the voltage available across the system Power plants can be run below their normal output with the facility to increase the amount they generate almost instantaneously This is termed spinning reserve Additional generation can be brought online Typically these would be hydroelectric or gas turbines which can be started in a matter of minutes The problem with standby gas turbines is higher costs expensive generating equipment is unused much of the time Spinning reserve also comes at a cost plants run below maximum output are usually less efficient Grid energy storage is used to shift generation from times of peak load to offpeak hours Power plants are able to run at their peak efficiency during nights and weekends Supplydemand leveling strategies may be intended to reduce the cost of supplying peak power or to compensate for the intermittent generation of wind and solar power Energy demand management Main article Energy demand management In order to keep the supply of electricity consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management DSM For decades utilities have sold offpeak power to large consumers at lower rates to encourage these users to shift their loads to offpeak hours in the same way that telephone companies do with individual customers Usually these timedependent prices are negotiated ahead of time In an attempt to save more money some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minutebyminute spot prices which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money Demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers In residential and small business applications for example appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters air conditioning units refrigerators and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to offpeak hours A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment For example many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation weatherstripping and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70 more efficient as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional airsourced heat pumps or resistive heating Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment like boilers or use more efficient processes to produce products Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide Energy Storage as a Service ESaaS Portability This is the area of greatest success for current energy storage technologies Singleuse and rechargeable batteries are ubiquitous and provide power for devices with demands as varied as digital watches and cars Advances in battery technology have generally been slow however with much of the advance in battery life that consumers see being attributable to efficient power management rather than increased storage capacity Portable consumer electronics have benefited greatly from size and power reductions associated with Moores law Unfortunately Moores law does not apply to hauling people and freight the underlying energy requirements for transportation remain much higher than for information and entertainment applications Battery capacity has become an issue as pressure grows for alternatives to internal combustion engines in cars trucks buses trains ships and aeroplanes These uses require far more energy density the amount of energy stored in a given volume or weight than current battery technology can deliver Liquid hydrocarbon fuel such as gasolinepetrol and diesel as well as alcohols methanol ethanol and butanol and lipids straight vegetable oil biodiesel have much higher energy densities There are synthetic pathways for using electricity to reduce carbon dioxide and water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels These pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse water gas shift reaction Nonfossil sources of carbon dioxide include fermentation plants and sewage treatment plants Converting electrical energy to carbonbased liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other enginedriven equipment without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic energy carrier These synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve energy security in nations that rely on imported petroleum but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity as well as to deal with possible future declines in the amount of petroleum available to import Because the transport sector uses the energy from petroleum very inefficiently replacing petroleum with electricity for mobile energy will not require very large investments over many years Reliability Virtually all devices that operate on electricity are adversely affected by the sudden removal of their power supply Solutions such as UPS uninterruptible power supplies or backup generators are available but these are expensive Efficient methods of power storage would allow for devices to have a builtin backup for power cuts and also reduce the impact of a failure in a generating station Examples of this are currently available using fuel cells and flywheels See also Energy portal Sustainable development portal Battery electric vehicles Batterytogrid Cost of electricity by source Distributed generation
