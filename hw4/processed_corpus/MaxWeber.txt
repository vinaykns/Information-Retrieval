 For other people named Max Weber see Max Weber disambiguation Karl Emil Maximilian Max Weber German ˈmaks ˈveːbɐ 21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920 was a German sociologist philosopher jurist and political economist whose ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research Weber is often cited with Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx as among the three founders of sociology Weber was a key proponent of methodological antipositivism arguing for the study of social action through interpretive rather than purely empiricist means based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions Unlike Durkheim he did not believe in monocausality and rather proposed that for any outcome there can be multiple causes Webers main intellectual concern was understanding the processes of rationalisation secularisation and disenchantment that he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity and which he saw as the result of a new way of thinking about the world Weber is best known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the sociology of religion elaborated in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism in which he proposed that ascetic Protestantism was one of the major elective affinities associated with the rise in the Western world of marketdriven capitalism and the rationallegal nationstate He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism Thus it can be said that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values Against Marxs historical materialism Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism The Protestant Ethic formed the earliest part in Webers broader investigations into world religion he went on to examine the religions of China the religions of India and ancient Judaism with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of social stratification In another major work Politics as a Vocation Weber defined the state as an entity that successfully claims a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory He was also the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms which he labelled as charismatic traditional and rationallegal His analysis of bureaucracy emphasised that modern state institutions are increasingly based on rationallegal authority Weber also made a variety of other contributions in economic history as well as economic theory and methodology Webers analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the Frankfurt School After the First World War Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the illfated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919 After contracting Spanish flu he died of pneumonia in 1920 aged 56 Biography Early life and family background Karl Emil Maximilian Weber was born in 1864 in Erfurt Province of Saxony Prussia He was the oldest of the seven children of Max Weber Sr a wealthy and prominent civil servant and member of the National Liberal Party and his wife Helene Fallenstein who partly descended from French Huguenot immigrants and held strong moral absolutist ideas Weber Srs involvement in public life immersed his home in both politics and academia as his salon welcomed many prominent scholars and public figures The young Weber and his brother Alfred who also became a sociologist and economist thrived in this intellectual atmosphere Webers 1876 Christmas presents to his parents when he was thirteen years old were two historical essays entitled About the course of German history with special reference to the positions of the Emperor and the Pope and About the Roman Imperial period from Constantine to the migration of nations In class bored and unimpressed with the teachers – who in turn resented what they perceived as a disrespectful attitude – he secretly read all forty volumes of Goethe and it has been recently argued that this was an important influence on his thought and methodology Before entering the university he would read many other classical works Over time Weber would also be significantly affected by the marital tension between his father a man who enjoyed earthly pleasures and his mother a devout Calvinist who sought to lead an ascetic life Education In 1882 Weber enrolled in the University of Heidelberg as a law student After a year of military service he transferred to the University of Berlin After his first few years as a student during which he spent much time drinking beer and fencing Weber would increasingly take his mothers side in family arguments and grew estranged from his father Simultaneously with his studies he worked as a junior lawyer In 1886 Weber passed the examination for Referendar comparable to the bar association examination in the British and American legal systems Throughout the late 1880s Weber continued his study of law and history He earned his law doctorate in 1889 by writing a dissertation on legal history titled Development of the Principle of Joint Liability and the Separate Fund in the Public Trading Company out of Household and Trade Communities in Italian Cities This work was used as part of a longer work On the History of Trading Companies in the Middle Ages based on SouthEuropean Sources published in the same year Two years later Weber completed his Habilitationsschrift Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law working with August Meitzen Having thus become a Privatdozent Weber joined the University of Berlins faculty lecturing and consulting for the government Early work In the years between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation Weber took an interest in contemporary social policy In 1888 he joined the Verein für Socialpolitik a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the historical school who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues He also involved himself in politics joining the leftleaning Evangelical Social Congress In 1890 the Verein established a research program to examine the Polish question or Ostflucht the influx of Polish farm workers into eastern Germany as local labourers migrated to Germanys rapidly industrialising cities Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report which generated considerable attention and controversy and marked the beginning of Webers renown as a social scientist From 1893 to 1899 Weber was a member of the Alldeutscher Verband PanGerman League an organization that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers the degree of Webers support for the Germanisation of Poles and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars In some of his work in particular his provocative lecture on The Nation State and Economic Policy delivered in 1895 Weber criticises the immigration of Poles and blames the Junker class for perpetuating Slavic immigration to serve their selfish interests Also in 1893 he married his distant cousin Marianne Schnitger later a feminist activist and author in her own right who was instrumental in collecting and publishing Webers journal articles as books after his death while her biography of him is an important source for understanding Webers life They would have no children and it is usually acknowledged that their marriage was never consummated The marriage granted longawaited financial independence to Weber allowing him to finally leave his parents household The couple moved to Freiburg in 1894 where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the university before accepting the same position at the University of Heidelberg in 1896 There Weber became a central figure in the socalled Weber Circle composed of other intellectuals such as his wife Marianne Georg Jellinek Ernst Troeltsch Werner Sombart Marc Bloch Robert Michels and György Lukács Weber also remained active in the Verein and the Evangelical Social Congress His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history In 1897 Max Weber Sr died two months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved After this Weber became increasingly prone to depression nervousness and insomnia making it difficult for him to fulfill his duties as a professor His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899 After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900 Weber and his wife travelled to Italy at the end of the year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902 He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919 Webers ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Webers work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known Later work After Webers immense productivity in the early 1890s he did not publish any papers between early 1898 and late 1902 finally resigning his professorship in late 1903 Freed from those obligations in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare where he worked with his colleagues Edgar Jaffé de and Werner Sombart His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars In 1904 Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal notably his essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism which became his most famous work and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems This essay was the only one of his works from that period that was published as a book during his lifetime Some other of his works written in the first one and a half decades of the 20th century – published posthumously and dedicated primarily from the fields of sociology of religion economic and legal sociology – are also recognised as among his most important intellectual contributions Also in 1904 he visited the United States and participated in the Congress of Arts and Sciences held in connection with the Worlds Fair Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis A monument to his visit was placed at the home of relatives whom Weber visited in Mt Airy North Carolina Despite his partial recovery evident in America Weber felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar helped by an inheritance in 1907 In 1909 disappointed with the Verein he cofounded the German Sociological Association Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie or DGS and served as its first treasurer He would however resign from the DGS in 1912 In 1912 Weber tried to organise a leftwing political party to combine socialdemocrats and liberals This attempt was unsuccessful in part because many liberals feared socialdemocratic revolutionary ideals Political involvements At the outbreak of World War I Weber aged 50 volunteered for service and was appointed as a reserve officer and put in charge of organizing the army hospitals in Heidelberg a role he fulfilled until the end of 1915 Webers views on the war and the expansion of the German empire changed during the course of the conflict Early on he supported the nationalist rhetoric and the war effort though with some hesitation as he viewed the war as a necessity to fulfill German duty as a leading state power In time however Weber became one of the most prominent critics of German expansionism and of the Kaisers war policies He publicly attacked the Belgian annexation policy and unrestricted submarine warfare and later supported calls for constitutional reform democratisation and universal suffrage Weber joined the worker and soldier council of Heidelberg in 1918 He then served in the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform which drafted the Weimar Constitution Motivated by his understanding of the American model he advocated a strong popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counterbalance to the power of the professional bureaucracy More controversially he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers Weber also ran unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat as a member of the liberal German Democratic Party which he had cofounded He opposed both the leftist German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles principled positions that defied the political alignments in Germany at that time and which may have prevented Friedrich Ebert the new socialdemocratic President of Germany from appointing Weber as minister or ambassador Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence Webers role in German politics remains controversial to this day In the case of Webers critique of the left he complained that the leaders of the leftist Spartacus League which was led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg and controlled the city government of Berlin while Weber was campaigning for his party We have this German revolution to thank for the fact that we cannot send a single division against the Poles All we see is dirt muck dung and horseplay—nothing else Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens” Weber was at the same time critical of the Versailles Treaty which he believed unjustly assigned war guilt to Germany when it came to World War I Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting World War I not just Germany In making this case Weber argued that “In the case of this war there is one and only one power that desired it under all circumstances through its own will and according to their political goals required Russia …It never crossed my mind that a German invasion of Belgium in 1914 was nothing but an innocent act on the part of the Germans Later that same month in January 1919 after Weber and Webers party were defeated for election Weber delivered one of his greatest academic lectures Politics as a Vocation which was a reflection on the inherent violence and dishonesty found among the politicians a profession in which only recently Weber was so personally active About the nature of politicians he concluded that In nine out of ten cases they are windbags puffed up with hot air about themselves They are not in touch with reality and they do not feel the burden they need to shoulder they just intoxicate themselves with romantic sensations Last years Frustrated with politics Weber resumed teaching during this time first at the University of Vienna then after 1919 at the University of Munich His lectures from that period were collected into major works such as the General Economic History Science as a Vocation and Politics as a Vocation In Munich he headed the first German university institute of sociology but never held a professorial position in sociology Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the German Revolution and some rightwing students held protests in front of his home Max Weber contracted the Spanish flu and died of pneumonia in Munich on 14 June 1920 At the time of his death Weber had not finished writing his magnum opus on sociological theory Economy and Society His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921–22 Max Webers thought Max Webers bureaucratic theory or model is sometimes also known as the LegalRational model The model tries to explain bureaucracy from a rational point of view via nine main characteristics or principles these are as follows Max Webers Bureaucratic Model LegalRational Model Weber wrote that the modern bureaucracy in both the public and private sector relies on the following principles First it is based on the general principle of precisely defined and organized acrosstheboard competencies of the various offices These competencies are underpinned by rules laws or administrative regulations For Weber this means A rigid division of labor is established which clearly identifies the regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system There are firmly established chains of command and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply is described by regulation Regular and continuous execution of the assigned duties is undertaken by hiring people with particular qualifications which are certified Weber notes that these three aspects constitute the essence of bureaucratic administrationin the public sector In the private sector these three aspects constitute the essence of a bureaucratic management of a private company Main Principles Characteristics Specialized roles Recruitment based on merit eg tested through open competition Uniform principles of placement promotion and transfer in an administrative system Careerism with systematic salary structure Hierarchy responsibility and accountability Subjection of official conduct to strict rules of discipline and control Supremacy of abstract rules Impersonal authority eg Office bearer does not bring the office with him Political neutrality Merits Max Weber himself noted real bureaucracy will be less optimal and effective than his ideal type model Each of Webers principles can degenerate more so when it is utilized to analyze the individual level in the organization But when implemented in a group setting in an organization some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved especially with regards to better output This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification merits specialization of jobscope labour hierarchy of power rules and discipline Demerits However competencies efficiency and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory especially when dealing with oversimplified matters In a dehumanized bureaucracy inflexible in distributing the jobscope with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom Thus employees can sometimes feel that they are not part of the organizations work vision and missions Consequently they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term Furthermore this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules regulations and procedures Inspirations Webers thinking was strongly influenced by German idealism and particularly by neoKantianism to which he had been exposed through Heinrich Rickert his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg Especially important to Webers work is the neoKantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible with all rational order deriving from the way in which the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions Webers opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neoKantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel Weber was also influenced by Kantian ethics which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties In this last respect the influence of Friedrich Nietzsches philosophy is evident According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy the deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Webers ethical worldview Another major influence in Webers life was the writings of Karl Marx and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics While Weber shares some of Marxs consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia Though the influence of his mothers Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Webers life and work and though he maintained a deep lifelong interest in the study of religions Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious As a political economist and economic historian Weber belonged to the youngest German historical school of economics represented by academics such as Gustav von Schmoller and his student Werner Sombart But even though Webers research interests were very much in line with that school his views on methodology and the theory of value diverged significantly from those of other German historicists and were closer in fact to those of Carl Menger and the Austrian School the traditional rivals of the historical school See section on Economics Methodology Unlike some other classical figures Comte Durkheim Weber did not attempt consciously to create any specific set of rules governing social sciences in general or sociology in particular In comparison with Durkheim and Marx Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology Whereas Durkheim focused on the society Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions see structure and action discussion and whereas Marx argued for the primacy of the material world over the world of ideas Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals at least in the big picture Sociology for Max Weber is a science which attempts the interpretive understanding of social action in order thereby to arrive at a causal explanation of its course and effects — Max Weber Weber was concerned with the question of objectivity and subjectivity Weber distinguished social action from social behavior noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another Study of social action through interpretive means Verstehen must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding that of the scientist Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of foolproof universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited Overall Weber supported the goal of objective science but he noted that it is an unreachable goal – although one definitely worth striving for There is no absolutely objective scientific analysis of culture All knowledge of cultural reality is always knowledge from particular points of view an objective analysis of cultural events which proceeds according to the thesis that the ideal of science is the reduction of empirical reality to laws is meaningless because the knowledge of social laws is not knowledge of social reality but is rather one of the various aids used by our minds for attaining this end — Max Weber Objectivity in Social Science 1904 The principle of methodological individualism which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities such as nations cultures governments churches corporations etc solely as the result and the context of the actions of individual persons can be traced to Weber particularly to the first chapter of Economy and Society in which he argues that only individuals can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action In other words Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically only to the extent that they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals models that Weber called ideal types from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality but provide objective benchmarks against which reallife constructs can be measured We know of no scientifically ascertainable ideals To be sure that makes our efforts more arduous than in the past since we are expected to create our ideals from within our breast in the very age of subjectivist culture — Max Weber 1909 Webers methodology was developed in the context of a wider debate about methodology of social sciences the Methodenstreit Webers position was close to historicism as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals social actors Thus Webers methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis Therefore Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future Rationalisation Many scholars have described rationalisation and the question of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society as the main theme of Webers work This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motivations cultural values and beliefs primarily religion and the structure of the society usually determined by the economy By rationalisation Weber understood first the individual costbenefit calculation second the wider bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and finally in the more general sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic disenchantment The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and above all by the disenchantment of the world — Max Weber Weber began his studies of the subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations particularly Calvinism shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain In Protestant religion Christian piety towards God was expressed through ones secular vocation secularisation of calling The rational roots of this doctrine he argued soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded Weber continued his investigation into this matter in later works notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classification of legitimate authority into three types – Rationallegal traditional and charismatic – of which the rationallegal through bureaucracy is the dominant one in the modern world In these works Weber described what he saw as societys movement towards rationalisation Similarly rationalisation could be seen in the economy with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart from the rest of the world Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics religion psychology and culture changes that first took place in the Western civilisation What Weber depicted was not only the secularisation of Western culture but also and especially the development of modern societies from the viewpoint of rationalisation The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposiverational economic and administrative action To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalisation traditional forms of life – which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to ones trade – were dissolved — Jürgen Habermas Modernitys Consciousness of Time 1990 1985 Features of rationalisation include increasing knowledge growing impersonality and enhanced control of social and material life Weber was ambivalent towards rationalisation while admitting it was responsible for many advances in particular freeing humans from traditional restrictive and illogical social guidelines he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as cogs in the machine and curtailing their freedom trapping them in the bureaucratic iron cage of rationality and bureaucracy Related to rationalisation is the process of disenchantment in which the world is becoming more explained and less mystical moving from polytheistic religions to monotheistic ones and finally to the Godless science of modernity Those processes affect all of society removing sublime values from public life and making art less creative In a dystopian critique of rationalisation Weber notes that modern society is a product of an individualistic drive of the Reformation yet at the same time the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism How is it at all possible to salvage any remnants of individual freedom of movement in any sense given this allpowerful trend — Max Weber Sociology of religion Webers work in the field of sociology of religion started with the essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and continued with the analysis of The Religion of China Confucianism and Taoism The Religion of India The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism and Ancient Judaism His work on other religions was interrupted by his sudden death in 1920 which prevented him from following Ancient Judaism with studies of early Christianity and Islam His three main themes in the essays were the effect of religious ideas on economic activities the relation between social stratification and religious ideas and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation Weber saw religion as one of the core forces in society His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient although without judging or valuing them like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation In the analysis of his findings Weber maintained that Calvinist and more widely Protestant religious ideas had had a major impact on the social innovation and development of the economic system of the West but noted that they were not the only factors in this development Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit merging observation with mathematics science of scholarship and jurisprudence rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise In the end the study of the sociology of religion according to Weber focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture the decline of beliefs in magic or what he referred to as disenchantment of the world Weber also proposed a socioevolutionary model of religious change showing that in general societies have moved from magic to polytheism then to pantheism monotheism and finally ethical monotheism According to Weber this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation and the evolution of ever more sophisticated priesthood As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised the concept of a single universal God became more popular and desirable The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Main article The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Webers essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is his most famous work It is argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism but rather as an introduction into Webers later works especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism He noted the postReformation shift of Europes economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France Spain and Italy and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands England Scotland and Germany Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy Similarly in societies with different religions most successful business leaders were Protestant Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world The development of the concept of the calling quickly gave to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience – and also industrious workers he gave to his employees as the wages of their ascetic devotion to the calling and of cooperation in his ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect of eternal salvation — Max Weber Christian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs including economic pursuit Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism – notably Calvinism – were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the Reformation In particular the Protestant ethic or more specifically Calvinist ethic motivated the believers to work hard be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures The notion of calling meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation just being a member of the Church was not enough Predestination also reduced agonising over economic inequality and further it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of salvation in the afterlife The believers thus justified pursuit of profit with religion as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy This Weber called the spirit of capitalism it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind – and inevitably led to – the capitalist economic system This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marxs thesis that the economic base of society determines all other aspects of it Weber abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch a professional theologian had begun work on the book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects Another reason for Webers decision was that Troeltschs work already achieved what he desired in that area laying the groundwork for a comparative analysis of religion and society The phrase work ethic used in modern commentary is a derivative of the Protestant ethic discussed by Weber It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people Jews and other nonChristians and thus lost its religious connotations The Religion of China Confucianism and Taoism Main article The Religion of China Confucianism and Taoism The Religion of China Confucianism and Taoism was Webers second major work on the sociology of religion Hans H Gerth edited and translated this text into English with an introduction by C K Wang Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe especially those aspects that contrasted with Puritanism His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy primarily Confucianism and Taoism as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route According to Weber Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of rational thought each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma Notably they both valued selfcontrol and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth However to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference Confucianisms goal was a cultured status position while Puritanisms goal was to create individuals who are tools of God The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism but common in Protestantism Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian Therefore Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality shaped by the respective dominant religions that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China The Religion of India The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism Main article The Religion of India The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism The Religion of India The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Webers third major work on the sociology of religion In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society In Webers view Hinduism in India like Confucianism in China was a barrier for capitalism The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste Activity including economic activity was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the soul Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from his previous work on China to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldly mystical experience The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite following the guidance of a prophet or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic In Asia there was no Messianic prophecy to give plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies also called ethical prophecies notably from the Near East region to the exemplary prophecies found on the Asiatic mainland focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live ones life usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world It was those differences that prevented the countries of the Occident from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations His next work Ancient Judaism was an attempt to prove this theory Ancient Judaism Main article Ancient Judaism book In Ancient Judaism his fourth major work on the sociology of religion Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world rather than withdraw from its imperfections This fundamental characteristic of Christianity when compared to Far Eastern religions stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy Weber claimed that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occidental state Judaisms influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures Webers premature death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of Psalms the Book of Job Talmudic Jewry early Christianity and Islam Economy and Society Main article Economy and Society Webers magnum opus Economy and Society is a collection of his essays which he was working on at the time of his death in 1920 After his death the final organization and editing of the book fell to his widow Marianne Weber The final German form published in 1921 reflected very much Marianne Webers work and intellectual commitment Beginning in 1956 the German jurist Johannes Wincklemann began editing and organizing the German edition of Economy and Society based on his study of the papers that Weber left at his death English versions of Economy and Society were published as a collected volume in 1968 as edited by Gunther Roth and Claus Wittich As a result of the various editions in German and English there are differences between the organization of the different volumes Economy and Society includes a wide range of essays dealing with Webers views regarding Sociology Social Philosophy Politics Social Stratification World Religion Diplomacy and other subjects The book is typically published in a two volume set in both German and English and is more than 1000 pages long Theodicy of Fortune and Misfortune The Theodicy of fortune and misfortune within sociology is the theory as Weber suggested of how members of different social classes adopt different belief systems or theodices to explain their social situation The concept of theodicy was expanded mainly with the thought of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion There is this ethical part of religion including 1 soteriology and 2 theodicy These mean respectively how people understand themselves to be able to be in a correct relationship with supernatural powers and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil In contrast theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved Weber also writes that the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of Godwhile theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion Weber defines the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the two theodicies and to what class structures they apply The concept of work ethic is attached to the theodicy of fortune thus because of the Protestant work ethic there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class is that those of lower status the poor cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth These two theodicies can be found in the denominational segregation within the religious community The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains For example mainline churches with their upper class congregations promoted order stability and conservatism and in so doing proved to be a powerful source of legitimation of the status quo and of existing disparities in the distribution of wealth and power because much of the wealth of the church comes from the congregation In contrast Pentecostal churches adopted the theodicy of misfortune They instead advocated change intended to advance the cause of justice and fairness Thus the learned and upper class religious churches who preach the theodicy of fortune ultimately support capitalism and corporation while the churches who adopted the theodicy of misfortune instead preached equality and fairness Politics and government In political sociology one of Webers most influential contributions is his Politics as a Vocation Politik als Beruf essay Therein Weber unveils the definition of the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of states power between various groups and political leaders are those who wield this power A politician must not be a man of the true Christian ethic understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount that is to say the injunction to turn the other cheek An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a saint for it is only saints according to Weber that can appropriately follow it The political realm is no realm for saints a politician ought to marry the ethic of attitude and the ethic of responsibility Verantwortungsethik vs Gesinnungsethik and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions the governed Weber distinguished three ideal types of political leadership alternatively referred to as three types of domination legitimisation or authority charismatic domination familial and religious traditional domination patriarchs patrimonialism feudalism and legal domination modern law and state bureaucracy In his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of this tripartite distinction He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to routinise into a more structured form of authority In a pure type of traditional rule sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a traditional revolution The move towards a rationallegal structure of authority utilising a bureaucratic structure is inevitable in the end Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory This ties to his broader concept of rationalisation by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge — Max Weber Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece Economy and Society 1922 His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term Many aspects of modern public administration go back to him and a classic hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called Weberian civil service As the most efficient and rational way of organising bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rationallegal authority and furthermore he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy The growth in space and population being administered the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy – these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible and popularly requested and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally Webers ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity by action taken and recorded on the basis of written rules by bureaucratic officials needing expert training by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations not by individuals The decisive reason for the advance of the bureaucratic organisation has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organisation — Max Weber While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a polar night of icy darkness in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned iron cage of bureaucratic rulebased rational control In order to counteract bureaucrats the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians Social stratification Weber also formulated a threecomponent theory of stratification with social class social status and political party as conceptually distinct elements The threecomponent theory of stratification is in contrast to Karl Marx simpler theory of social class which ties all social stratification to what people own In Webers theory issues of honour and prestige are important This distinction is most clearly described in Webers essay Classes Staende Parties which was first published in his book Economy and Society The three components of Webers theory are Social Class which is based on economically determined relationship to the market owner renter employee etc Status or in German Stand which is based on noneconomic qualities like honour prestige and religion Party which refers to affiliations in the political domain All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called life chances opportunities to improve ones life Weber scholars recognize that it is important to maintain a sharp distinction between the terms status and class even though they tend to be used interchangeably in popular usage Study of the city As part of his overarching effort to understand the unique development of the Western world Weber produced a detailed general study of the city as the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations political arrangements and ideas that eventually came to define the West This resulted in a monograph titled The City which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–13 and which was published posthumously in 1921 In 1924 it was incorporated into the second part of his Economy and Society as chapter XVI The City Nonlegitimate Domination According to Weber the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity employed in a variety of specialised trades and physically separated from the surrounding countryside only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution The origin of a rational and innerworldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the bourgeois statusgroup of the city without which neither Judaism nor Christianity nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable — Max Weber Weber argued that Judaism early Christianity theology and later the political party and modern science were only possible in the urban context that reached a full development in the West alone He also saw in the history of medieval European cities the rise of a unique form of nonlegitimate domination that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate domination traditional charismatic and rationallegal that had prevailed until then in the Medieval world This new domination was based on the great economic and military power wielded by the organised community of citydwellers citizens Economics Weber regarded himself primarily as a political economist and all of his professorial appointments were in economics though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology As an economist Weber belonged to the youngest German historical school of economics The great differences between that schools interests and methods on the one hand and those of the neoclassical school from which modern mainstream economics largely derives on the other explain why Webers influence on economics today is hard to discern Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism In earlier texts Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism and its effects on the current means of productions This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons The first and most important he relates capitalism to Protestantism This is of course nothing new since Max Weber did it in the past However Korstanje adds though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind In effect the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture Secondly this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a riskprone culture which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society” The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber Methodological individualism Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists with a strong emphasis on interpreting economic history Webers defence of methodological individualism in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by Carl Menger the founder of the Austrian School of economics in the context of the academic Methodenstreit debate over methods of the late 19th century The phrase methodological individualism which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between microeconomics and macroeconomics was coined by the AustrianAmerican economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber According to Webers theses social research cannot be fully inductive or descriptive because understanding some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and interpret it interpretation requires classification according to abstract ideal pure types This together with his antipositivistic argumentation see Verstehen can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the rational economic man homo economicus which is at the heart of modern mainstream economics Marginalism and psychophysics Unlike other historicists Weber also accepted the marginal theory of value also called marginalism and taught it to his students In 1908 Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the WeberFechner law Max Webers article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of psychophysics by Lionel Robbins George Stigler and Friedrich Hayek though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of behavioral economics Economic history Webers best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development particularly the relations between religion and capitalism which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism as well as in his other works on the sociology of religion He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism including rational bookkeeping and organisation of formally free labour while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism which had a different social and political structure based on conquest slavery and the coastal citystate Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society 1891 and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany 1892 his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages 1889 his critique of Marxism the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society 1922 and his General Economic History 1923 a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School Although today Weber is primarily read by sociologists and social philosophers Webers work did have a significant influence on Frank Knight one of the founders of the neoclassical Chicago school of economics who translated Webers General Economic History into English in 1927 Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions that is the angle of comparative history in the broad sense Economic calculation Weber like his colleague Werner Sombart regarded economic calculation and especially the doubleentry bookkeeping method of business accounting as one of the most important forms of rationalisation associated with the development of modern capitalism Webers preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs Socialist intellectuals like Otto Neurath had realised that in a completely socialised economy prices would not exist and central planners would have to resort to inkind rather than monetary economic calculation According to Weber this type of coordination would be inefficient especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of imputation ie of accurately determining the relative values of capital goods Weber wrote that under full socialism In order to make possible a rational utilisation of the means of production a system of inkind accounting would have to determine value – indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the prices used in book valuation in modern business accounting But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular verified whether for instance they should vary from one production unit to the next on the basis of economic location or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy on the basis of social utility that is of present and future consumption requirements Nothing is gained by assuming that if only the problem of a nonmonetary economy were seriously enough attacked a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation We cannot speak of a rational planned economy so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational plan — Max Weber This argument against socialism was made independently at about the same time by Ludwig von Mises Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918 and through Mises on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century Friedrich Hayek in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economicss intellectual assault on socialism as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of dispersed knowledge in markets Legacy The prestige of Max Weber among European social scientists would be difficult to overestimate He is widely considered the greatest of German sociologists and has become a leading influence in European and American thought — Hans Heinrich Gerth and C Wright Mills From Max Weber Essays in Sociology 19461991 Webers most influential work was on economic sociology political sociology and the sociology of religion Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim he is commonly regarded as one of the founders of modern sociology But whereas Durkheim following Comte worked in the positivist tradition Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist hermeneutic tradition in the social sciences In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart Georg Simmel and Wilhelm Dilthey who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences Weber presented sociology as the science of human social action action that he separated into traditional affectional valuerational and instrumental Sociology is the science whose object is to interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which the action proceeds and the effects which it produces By action in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as subjectively meaningful the meaning to which we refer may be either a the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases or b the meaning attributed to the agent or agents as types in a pure type constructed in the abstract In neither case is the meaning to be thought of as somehow objectively correct or true by some metaphysical criterion This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action such as sociology and history and any kind of a priori discipline such as jurisprudence logic ethics or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subjectmatter correct or valid meaning — Max Weber The Nature of Social Action 1922 In his own time however Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist The breadth of Webers topical interests is apparent in the depth of his social theory The affinity between capitalism and Protestantism the religious origins of the Western world the force of charisma in religion as well as in politics the allembracing process of rationalisation and the bureaucratic price of progress the role of legitimacy and of violence as the offspring of leadership the disenchantment of the modern world together with the neverending power of religion the antagonistic relation between intellectualism and eroticism all these are key concepts which attest to the enduring fascination of Webers thinking — Joachim Radkau Max Weber A Biography 2005 Many of Webers works famous today were collected revised and published posthumously Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C Wright Mills Parsons in particular imparted to Webers works a functionalist teleological perspective this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism Weber has influenced many later social theorists such as Theodor Adorno Max Horkheimer György Lukács and Jürgen Habermas Different elements of his thought were emphasised by Carl Schmitt Joseph Schumpeter Ludwig Lachmann Leo Strauss Hans Morgenthau and Raymond Aron According to Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises who had met Weber during his time at the University of Vienna The early death of this genius was a great disaster for Germany Had Weber lived longer the German people of today would be able to look to this example of an Aryan who would not be broken by National Socialism — Ludwig von Mises 1940 Webers friend the psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher Karl Jaspers described him as the greatest German of our era Webers untimely death felt to Jaspers as if the German world had lost its heart Critical responses to Weber Webers explanations are highly specific to the historical periods he analysed Some academics disagree pointing out that despite the fact that Weber did write in the early twentieth century his ideas remain alive and relevant for understanding issues like politics bureaucracy and social stratification today Many scholars however have disagreed with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis For example the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism did not begin with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy In Milan Venice and Florence the small citystate governments led to the development of the earliest forms of capitalism In the 16th century Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe Also the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands England and New England It has been pointed out that the Netherlands which had a Calvinist majority industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeters argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value Works For an extensive list of Max Webers works see Max Weber bibliography Weber wrote in German Original
