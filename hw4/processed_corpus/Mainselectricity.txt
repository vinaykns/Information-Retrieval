 Mains electricity is the generalpurpose alternatingcurrent AC electric power supply Mains electricity is the form of electrical power that is delivered to homes and businesses and it is the form of electrical power that consumers use when they plug kitchen appliances televisions and electric lamps into wall sockets The two principal properties of the electric power supply voltage and frequency differ between regions A voltage of nominally 230 V and a frequency of 50 Hz is used in Europe most of Africa most of Asia most of South America and Australia In North America the most common combination is 120 V and a frequency of 60 Hz Other voltages exist and some countries may have for example 230 V but 60 Hz This is a concern to travelers since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate with or may be destroyed by another The use of different and incompatible plugs and sockets in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements Terminology In the US mains electric power is referred to by several names including household power household electricity house current powerline domestic power wall power line power AC power city power street power and the grid In the UK mains electric power is generally referred to as the mains Power systems For a list of voltages frequencies and wall plugs by country see Mains electricity by country Worldwide many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting The different systems are primarily characterized by their Voltage Frequency Plugs and sockets receptacles or outlets Earthing system grounding Protection against overcurrent damage eg due to short circuit electric shock and fire hazards Parameter tolerances All these parameters vary among regions The voltages are generally in the range 100–240 V always expressed as rootmeansquare voltage The two commonly used frequencies are 50 Hz and 60 Hz Singlephase or threephase power is most commonly used today although twophase systems were used early in the 20th century Foreign enclaves such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas Some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside eg in Libya Regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority with electric power provided by incompatible private sources Many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used with frequencies between 25 Hz and 133 Hz and voltages from 100 V to 250 V Direct current DC has been almost completely displaced by alternating current AC in public power systems but DC was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century The modern combinations of 230 V50 Hz and 120 V60 Hz listed in IEC 60038 did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal Industrial plants with threephase power will have different higher voltages installed for large equipment and different sockets and plugs but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment Common uses of electricity Electricity is used for lighting heating cooling electric motors and electronic equipment The US Energy Information Administration EIA has published Estimated US residential electricity consumption by end use for the year 2014 Electronic appliances such as those included within the televisions computer and related equipment categories above representing 9 of the total typically use an AC to DC converter to power the device this is often capable of operation over the approximate range of 100 V to 250 V and at 50 Hz to 60 Hz The other categories are typically AC applications and usually have much more restricted input ranges A study by the Building Research Establishment in the UK states that The existing 230 V system is well suited to the future of electricity whether through design or Darwinian processes Any current perceived weakness is generally a result of cost reduction and market forces rather than any fundamental technical difficulties Questions as to whether there are alternatives to the existing 230 V AC system are often overshadowed by legacy issues the future smart agenda and cost in all but specific situations Where opportunities do exist they are often for specific parts of the overall load and often small parts in terms of total demand Building wiring See also Electrical wiring In many countries household power is singlephase electric power with two or three wired contacts at each outlet Neutral and line wires carry current and are defined as live parts The line wire also known as phase hot or active contact and commonly but technically incorrectly as live carries alternating current between the power grid and the household The neutral wire completes the electrical circuit—remaining at a voltage in proximity to 0 V—by also carrying alternating current between the power grid and the household The neutral is connected to the ground Earth and therefore has nearly the same electrical potential as the earth This prevents the power circuits from increasing beyond earth voltage such as when they are struck by lightning or become otherwise charged The earth wire or ground connects the chassis of equipment to earth ground as a protection against faults electric shock such as if the insulation on a hot wire becomes damaged and the bare wire comes into contact with the metal chassis or case of the equipment For more details on this topic see Ground and neutral Mixed 230 V 400 V threephase common in northern and central Europe or 230 V singlephase based household wiring Various earthing systems are used to ensure that the ground and neutral wires have zero voltage with respect to earth to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment In some installations there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a singlephase threewire Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables these exist with either two or three insulated conductors terminated in a plug which is inserted into a fixed receptacle socket Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building For example in North American homes a windowmounted selfcontained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents higher voltages or three phase electric power These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weatherresistant properties needed in some applications Circuit breakers and fuses are used to detect short circuits between the line and neutral or ground wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle overload protection to prevent overheating and possible fire These protective devices are usually mounted in a central panel—most commonly a distribution board or consumer unit—in a building but some wiring systems also provide a protection device at the socket or within the plug Residualcurrent devices also known as groundfault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters are used to detect ground faults flow of current in other than the neutral and line wires like the ground wire or a person When a ground fault is detected the device quickly cuts off the circuit In northern and central Europe residential electrical supply is commonly 400 V threephase electric power which gives 230 V between any single phase and neutral house wiring may be a mix of threephase and singlephase circuits but threephase residential use is rare in the UK Highpower appliances such as kitchen stoves water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like log splitters may be supplied from the 400 V threephase power supply Voltage levels Most of Europe Africa Asia Australia New Zealand and most of South America use a supply that is within 6 of 230 V In the UK and Australia the nominal supply voltage is 230 V 10−6 to accommodate the fact that most supplies are in fact still 240 V Japan Taiwan Saudi Arabia North America Central America and some parts of northern South America use a voltage between 100 V and 127 V The 230 V standard has become widespread so that 230 V equipment can be used in most parts of the world with the aid of an adapter or a change to the equipments connection plug for the specific country Measuring voltage A distinction should be made between the voltage at the point of supply nominal system voltage and the voltage rating of the equipment utilization voltage Typically the utilization voltage is 3 to 5 lower than the nominal system voltage for example a nominal 208 V supply system will be connected to motors with 200 V on their nameplates This allows for the voltage drop between equipment and supply Voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages Power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature Voltages are expressed as root mean square RMS voltage Voltage tolerances are for steadystate operation Momentary heavy loads or switching operations in the power distribution network may cause shortterm deviations out of the tolerance band In general power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator Choice of voltage Main article Mains electricity by country The choice of supply voltage is due more to historical reasons than optimization of the distribution system—once a voltage is in use and equipment using this voltage is widespread changing voltage is a drastic and expensive measure A 230 V distribution system will use less conductor material than a 120 V system to deliver a given amount of power because the current and consequently the resistive loss is lower While large heating appliances can use smaller conductors at 230 V for the same output rating few household appliances use anything like the full capacity of the outlet to which they are connected Minimum wire size for handheld or portable equipment is usually restricted by the mechanical strength of the conductors Electrical appliances are used extensively in homes in both 230 V and 120 V system countries National electrical codes prescribe wiring methods intended to minimize the risk of electric shock and fire Many areas such as the USA which use nominally 120 V make use of threewire splitphase 240 V systems to supply large appliances In this system a 240 V supply has a centretapped neutral to give two 120 V supplies which can also supply 240 V to loads connected between the two line wires Threephase systems can be connected to give various combinations of voltage suitable for use by different classes of equipment Where both singlephase and threephase loads are served by an electrical system the system may be labelled with both voltages such as 120208 or 230400 V to show the linetoneutral voltage and the linetoline voltage Large loads are connected for the higher voltage Other threephase voltages up to 830 volts are occasionally used for specialpurpose systems such as oil well pumps Large industrial motors say more than 250 hp or 150 kW may operate on medium voltage On 60 Hz systems a standard for medium voltage equipment is 24004160 V whereas 3300 V is the common standard for 50 Hz systems Standardisation Following voltage harmonisation electricity supplies within the European Union are now nominally 230 V ±10 at 50 Hz For a transition period 1995–2008 countries that had previously used 220 V changed to a narrower asymmetric tolerance range of 230 V 6−10 and those like the UK that had previously used 240 V changed to 230 V 10−6 No change in voltage is required by either system as both 220 V and 240 V fall within the lower 230 V tolerance bands 230 V ±10 Some areas of the UK still have 250 volts for legacy reasons but these also fall within the 10 tolerance band of 230 volts In practice this allows countries to continue to supply the same voltage 220 or 240 V at least until existing supply transformers are replaced Equipment with the exception of filament bulbs used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range In the United States and Canada national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120 V and allow a range of 114 V to 126 V RMS −5 to 5 Historically 110 V 115 V and 117 V have been used at different times and places in North America Mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 V however 120 V is the nominal voltage In 2000 Australia converted to 230 V as the nominal standard with a tolerance of 10−6 this superseding the old 240 V standard AS29261987 As in the UK 240 V is within the allowable limits and 240 volt is a synonym for mains in Australian and British English In Japan the electrical power supply to households is at 100 V Eastern and northern parts of Honshū including Tokyo and Hokkaidō have a frequency of 50 Hz whereas western Honshū including Nagoya Osaka and Hiroshima Shikoku Kyūshū and Okinawa operate at 60 Hz The boundary between the two regions contains four backtoback highvoltage directcurrent HVDC substations which interconnect the power between the two grid systems these are Shin Shinano Sakuma Dam MinamiFukumitsu and the HigashiShimizu Frequency Converter To accommodate the difference frequencysensitive appliances marketed in Japan can often be switched between the two frequencies History of voltage and frequency See also Utility frequency The first electric utilities built by Thomas Edison in the early 1880s ran on direct current DC at 110 V considered to be a safe voltage for consumers Alternating current systems that started appearing mid decade used a high transmission voltage but stepped that down via transformers to the same 110 volt distribution voltage that Edison used In 1883 Edison patented a three wire distribution system to allow DC generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers This saved on copper costs since lamps were connected in series on a 220 volt system with a neutral conductor connected between to carry any imbalance between the two subcircuits This was later adapted to AC circuits Most lighting and small appliances ran on 120 V while big appliances could be connected to 240 V This system saved copper and was backwardcompatible with existing appliances Also the original plugs could be used with the revised system Later metal filament lamps became feasible In 1899 the Berliner ElektrizitätsWerke BEW a Berlin electrical utility decided to greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220 volt nominal distribution taking advantage of the higher voltage capability of metal filament lamps The company was able to offset the cost of converting the customers equipment by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost This became the model for electrical distribution in Germany and the rest of Europe and the 220volt system became common North American practice remained with voltages near 110 volts for lamps In the US at the end of the 19th century Westinghouse decided on 60 Hz and AEG in Germany decided on 50 Hz eventually leading to the world being mostly divided into two frequency camps Most 60 Hz systems are nominally 120 V and most 50 Hz nominally 230 V The significant exception is Brazil which has a synchronized 60 Hz grid with both 127 V and 220 V as standard voltages in different regions and Japan which has two frequencies 50 Hz for East Japan and 60 Hz for West Japan Voltage regulation To maintain the voltage at the customers service within the acceptable range electrical distribution utilities use regulating equipment at electrical substations or along the distribution line At a substation the stepdown transformer will have an automatic onload tap changer allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps For long several kilometres rural distribution circuits automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line These are autotransformers again with onload tapchangers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes At each customers service the stepdown transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment usually ±5 of the nominal voltage Since these taps are not automatically controlled they are used only to adjust the longterm average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer Power quality Main article Power quality The stability of the voltage and frequency supplied to customers varies among countries and regions Power quality is a term describing the degree of deviation from the nominal supply voltage and frequency Shortterm surges and dropouts affect sensitive electronic equipment such as computers and flat panel displays Longerterm power outages brownouts and black outs and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or standby generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable Erratic power supply may be a severe economic handicap to businesses and public services which rely on electrical machinery illumination climate control and computers Even the best quality power system may have breakdowns or require servicing As such companies governments and other organizations sometimes have backup generators at sensitive facilities to ensure that power will be available
