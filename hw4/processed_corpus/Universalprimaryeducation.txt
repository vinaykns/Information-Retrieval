 The second goal in the United Nations Millennium Development Goal is to achieve Universal Primary Education more specifically to “ensure that by 2015 children everywhere boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling Education is vital to meeting all other Millennium Development Goals Educating children gives the next generation the tools to fight poverty and prevent disease including malaria and AIDS Despite the significance of investing in education the recent report Fixing the Broken Promise of Education for All Findings from the Global Initiative on OutofSchool Children—produced by UNESCO Institute for Statistics and UNICEF found that the world has missed this 2015 target of universal primary education and there are currently 58 million children of primary school age out of school worldwide Achieving Universal Primary Education Since 1999 there has been great progress towards achieving universal primary enrollment due in large part to a pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals MDGs and the Education for All EFA The number of primary school age outofschool children dropped by 42 between 2000 and 2012 despite rapid population growth Greater than half of countries and regions worldwide have a net enrolment rate of more than 95 and either already have or are close to achieving universal primary education However despite an increase in enrollment over the past decade global progress has stalled since 2007 and net enrolment or attendance is less than 80 per cent in about 20 countries Of the 58 million children out of school 23 attended school in the past but left 43 are likely to never enter school 34 are likely to enter school in the future Roughly half of all outofschool children come from just a few countries many of them characterized by conflict instability and extreme poverty West and Central Africa is home to onethird of all primary school age outofschool children making it the region with the lowest rates of school participation Challenges to achieving universal primary education are exacerbated in unstable regions as they have greater difficulty in accessing financial support The barriers which prevent children around the world from obtaining primary level education are diverse and require tailored responses Children living in conflictaffected areas account for “just 20 of the world’s children of primary school age but 50 of the world’s outofschool children” Additionally inequalities in wealth significantly impact outofschool rates In many countries children from the poorest 20 per cent of the population are less likely to attend school than those who are better off Despite overall improvements girls continue to be at a disadvantage as 53—more than half—of the estimated 58 million primary age outofschoolchildren are girls Factors contributing to lack of access and poor attendance Location climate Location contributes to a child’s lack of access and attendance to primary education In certain areas of the world it is more difficult for children to get to school For example in highaltitude areas of India severe weather conditions for more than 7 months of the year make school attendance erratic and force children to remain at home Postiglione In these remote locations insufficient school funds contribute to low attendance rates by creating undesirable and unsafe learning environments In 1996 the General Accounting Office GAO reported that poor conditions existed in many rural areas one out of every two rural schools had at least one inadequate structural or mechanical feature Lawrence In these situations where regular school attendance is rare a low population contributes to the problem In other locations large numbers are often the cause of low attendance rates Due to population growth many urban schools have expanded their boundaries making school transportation more complicated “For over 50 years the US has been shifting away from small neighborhood schools to larger schools in lower density areas Rates of children walking and biking to school have declined significantly over this period” Schlossberg There is evidence to prove that the distance to and from school contributes a child’s attendance or lack thereof In a study done investigating the relation between location distance and school attendance in Mali about half the villages reported that the school was too far away causing students not to enroll Birdsall There is still speculation as to whether primary schools are more accessible in rural or urban areas because situations differ depending on geographic location In a study done examining the correlation between location and school attendance in Argentina and Panama researchers found that urban residence was positively correlated with school attendance De Vos but another study in a Louisiana school district found that schools with the lowest attendance rates were in metropolitan areas Moonie More research needs to be done to determine geography’s specific effects on attendance but no matter where you live there is evidence that location will contribute to a child’s access and attendance to education Gender Gender contributes to a childs lack of access and attendance to education Although it may not be as an obvious a problem today gender equality in education has been an issue for a long time Many investments in girls education in the 1900s addressed the widespread lack of access to primary education in developing countries Dowd There is currently a gender discrepancy in education In 25 countries the proportion of boys enrolling in secondary school is higher than girls by 10 or more and in five India Nepal Togo Turkey and Yemen the gap exceeds 20 Enrollment is low for both boys and girls in subSaharan Africa with rates of just 27 and 22 Girls trail respectively behind Douglas It is generally believed that girls are often discouraged from attending primary schooling especially in less developed countries for religious and cultural reasons but there is little evidence available to support this association However there is evidence to prove that the disparity of gender in education is real Today some 78 of girls drop out of school compared with 48 of boys Douglas A child’s gender continues to contribute to access and attendance today Cost Costs contribute to a child’s lack of acquiescence and attendance to primary education High opportunity costs are often influential in the decision to attend school For example an estimated 121 million children of primaryschool age are being kept out of school to work in the fields or at home UNICEF For many families in developing countries the economic benefits of no primary schooling are enough to offset the opportunity cost of attending Besides the opportunity costs associated with education school fees can be very expensive especially for poor households In rural China families dedicate as much as a third of their income to school fees Peverly Sometimes the cost gets too expensive and families can’t support their children’s education anymore although the statistics disagree China has 1086 million primary school students with a 1 percent dropout rate but experts doubt these figures because the dropout rates in rural areas appear much higher Peverly Although the relationship between school fees and attendance still isn’t perfectly clear Peverly there is evidence to prove that cost is a factor that contributes to a child’s access and attendance to primary education Language In developing countries throughout the world the educational context is characterized not by monolingual settings but rather multilingual situations Often children are asked to enroll in a primary school where the Medium of Instruction MI is not her home language but rather the language of the government or another dominant society 1234 Studies throughout the world demonstrate the importance of the MI in determining a childs educational attainment According to Mehrotra 1988 In a situation where the parents are illiterate if the medium of instruction in school is a language that is not spoken at home the problems of learning in an environment characterized by poverty are compounded and the chances of dropout increase correspondingly In this context the experience of the highachievers has been unequivocal the mother tongue was used as the medium of instruction at the primary level in all cases There is much research which shows that students learn to read more quickly when taught in their mother tongue Second students who have learned to read in their mother tongue learn to read in a second language more quickly than do those who are first taught to read in the second language Third in terms of academic learning skills as well students taught to read in their mother tongue acquire such skills more quickly See also Multilingual Education Education and global health Education is a crucial factor in ending global poverty With education employment opportunities are broadened income levels are increased and maternal and child health is improved In areas where access attendance and quality of education have seen improvements there has also been a slow in the spread of HIVAIDS and an increase in the healthiness of the community in general In fact children of educated mothers are 50 more likely to live past the age of five Not only does education improve individual and familial health but it also improves the health of a community In countries with solid education systems in place there are lower crime rates greater economic growth and improved social services School feeding programs “There are approximately 300 million chronically hungry children in the world One hundred million of them do not attend school and two thirds of those not attending school are girls World Food Programmes school feeding formula is simple food attracts hungry children to school An education broadens their options helping to lift them out of poverty”–World Food Programme One successful method to ensuring that children attend school on a regular basis is through school feeding programs Many different organizations fund school feeding programs among them the World Food Programme and the World Bank The idea of a school feeding program is that children are provided with meals at school with the expectation that they will attend school regularly School feeding programs have proven a huge success because not only do the attendance rates increase but in areas where food is scarce and malnutrition is extensive the food that children are receiving at school can prove to be a critical source of nutrition School meals have led to improved concentration and performance of children in school Another aspect of school feeding programs is take home rations When economic reasons the need to care for the elderly or a family member suffering from HIV or cultural beliefs keep a parent from sending their child especially a female child to school these take home rations provide incentives to sending their children to school rather than to work Current Efforts Global Campaign for Education This organization promotes education as a basic human right It motivates people and groups to put public pressure on governments and the international community in order to assure that all children are provided with free compulsory public education It brings together major NGOs and Teachers Unions in over 120 countries to work in solidarity towards their vision of universal primary
