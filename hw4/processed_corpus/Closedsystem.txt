 This article is about closed physical systems as the term is used in the physical sciences For software in computing whose source code is kept secret see Closed source software A closed system is a physical system that does not allow certain types of transfers such as transfer of mass in or out of the system The specification of what types of transfers are excluded varies in the closed systems of physics chemistry or engineering In physics In classical mechanics In nonrelativistic classical mechanics a closed system is a physical system that doesnt exchange any matter with its surroundings and isnt subject to any force whose source is external to the system A closed system in classical mechanics would be considered an isolated system in thermodynamics Closed systems are often used to limit the factors that can affect the results of specific problem or experiment In thermodynamics Main article Thermodynamic system In thermodynamics a closed system can exchange energy as heat or work but not matter with its surroundings An isolated system cannot exchange any heat work or matter with the surroundings while an open system can exchange energy and matter This scheme of definition of terms is not uniformly used though it is convenient for some purposes In particular some writers use closed system where isolated system is here used For a simple system with only one type of particle atom or molecule a closed system amounts to a constant number of particles However for systems which are undergoing a chemical reaction there may be all sorts of molecules being generated and destroyed by the reaction process In this case the fact that the system is closed is expressed by stating that the total number of each elemental atom is conserved no matter what kind of molecule it may be a part of Mathematically ∑ j 1 m a i j N j b i displaystyle sum j1maijNjbi where N j displaystyle Nj is the number of jtype molecules a i j displaystyle aij is the number of atoms of element i in molecule j and bi is the total number of atoms of element i in the system which remains constant since the system is closed There will be one such equation for each different element in the system In thermodynamics a closed system is important for solving complicated thermodynamic problems It allows the elimination of some external factors that could alter the results of the experiment or problem thus simplifying it A closed system can also be used in situations where thermodynamic equilibrium is required to simplify the situation In quantum physics Further information Quantum field theory This equation called Schrödingers equation describes the behavior of an isolated or closed quantum system that is by definition a system which does not interchange information ie energy andor matter with another system So if an isolated system is in some pure state ψt ∈ H at time t where H denotes the Hilbert space of the system the time evolution of this state between two consecutive measurements i ℏ ∂ ∂ t Ψ r t H Ψ r t displaystyle ihbar frac partial partial tPsi leftmathbf r trighthat HPsi leftmathbf r tright where i is the imaginary unit ħ is the Planck constant divided by 2π the symbol ∂∂t indicates a partial derivative with respect to time t Ψ the Greek letter psi is the wave function of the quantum system and Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator which characterizes the total energy of any given wave function and takes different forms depending on the situation In chemistry In chemistry a closed system is where no reactants or products can escape only heat can be exchanged freely ex Ice cooler A closed system can be used when conducting chemical experiments where temperature is not a factor ie reaching thermal equilibrium In engineering In an engineering context a closed system is a bound system ie defined in which every input is known and every resultant is known or can be known within a specific time See also Glossary of systems theory Closedcircuit television CCTV Dynamical system Isolated system Open system systems theory Thermodynamic system Closed cycle rocket engine References
