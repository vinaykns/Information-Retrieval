 This article is about windpowered electrical generators For windpowered machinery used to grind grain or pump water see Windmill and Windpump A wind turbine is a device that converts the winds kinetic energy into electrical power Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs Slightly larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid Arrays of large turbines known as wind farms are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels History Main article History of wind power Windmills were used in Persia presentday Iran about 500–900 AD The windwheel of Hero of Alexandria marks one of the first known instances of wind powering a machine in history However the first known practical windmills were built in Sistan an Eastern province of Iran from the 7th century These Panemone were vertical axle windmills which had long vertical drive shafts with rectangular blades Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries Windmills first appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages The first historical records of their use in England date to the 11th or 12th centuries and there are reports of German crusaders taking their windmillmaking skills to Syria around 1190 By the 14th century Dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the Rhine delta Advanced wind mills were described by Croatian inventor Fausto Veranzio In his book Machinae Novae 1595 he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or Vshaped blades The first electricitygenerating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic James Blyth to light his holiday home in Marykirk Scotland Some months later American inventor Charles F Brush was able to build the first automatically operated wind turbine after consulting local University professors and colleagues Jacob S Gibbs and Brinsley Coleberd and successfully getting the blueprints peerreviewed for electricity production in Cleveland Ohio Although Blyths turbine was considered uneconomical in the United Kingdom electricity generation by wind turbines was more cost effective in countries with widely scattered populations In Denmark by 1900 there were about 2500 windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 MW The largest machines were on 24meter 79 ft towers with fourbladed 23meter 75 ft diameter rotors By 1908 there were 72 winddriven electric generators operating in the United States from 5 kW to 25 kW Around the time of World War I American windmill makers were producing 100000 farm windmills each year mostly for waterpumping By the 1930s wind generators for electricity were common on farms mostly in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed In this period hightensile steel was cheap and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers A forerunner of modern horizontalaxis wind generators was in service at Yalta USSR in 1931 This was a 100 kW generator on a 30meter 98 ft tower connected to the local 63 kV distribution system It was reported to have an annual capacity factor of 32 percent not much different from current wind machines In the autumn of 1941 the first megawattclass wind turbine was synchronized to a utility grid in Vermont The SmithPutnam wind turbine only ran for 1100 hours before suffering a critical failure The unit was not repaired because of shortage of materials during the war The first utility gridconnected wind turbine to operate in the UK was built by John Brown Company in 1951 in the Orkney Islands Despite these diverse developments developments in fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size In the early 1970s however antinuclear protests in Denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of 22 kW Organizing owners into associations and cooperatives lead to the lobbying of the government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the 1980s and later Local activists in Germany nascent turbine manufacturers in Spain and large investors in the United States in the early 1990s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries Later companies formed in India and China As of 2012 Danish company Vestas is the worlds biggest windturbine manufacturer Resources Main article Wind power A quantitative measure of wind energy available at any location is called the Wind Power Density WPD It is a calculation of the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine and is tabulated for different heights above ground Calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density Colorcoded maps are prepared for a particular area described for example as Mean Annual Power Density at 50 Metres In the United States the results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and referred to as NREL CLASS The larger the WPD the higher it is rated by class Classes range from Class 1 200 watts per square meter or less at 50 m altitude to Class 7 800 to 2000 watts per square m Commercial wind farms generally are sited in Class 3 or higher areas although isolated points in an otherwise Class 1 area may be practical to exploit Wind turbines are classified by the wind speed they are designed for from class I to class IV with A or B referring to the turbulence Efficiency Not all the energy of blowing wind can be used but some small wind turbines are designed to work at low wind speeds Conservation of mass requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal Accordingly Betzs law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 1627 593 of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine The maximum theoretical power output of a wind machine is thus 1627 times the kinetic energy of the air passing through the effective disk area of the machine If the effective area of the disk is A and the wind velocity v the maximum theoretical power output P is where ρ is the air density As wind is free no fuel cost windtorotor efficiency including rotor blade friction and drag is one of many aspects impacting the final price of wind power Further inefficiencies such as gearbox losses generator and converter losses reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine To protect components from undue wear extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed further reducing theoretical efficiency In 2001 commercial utilityconnected turbines deliver 75 to 80 of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind at rated operating speed Efficiency can decrease slightly over time due to wear Analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in Denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease while the other half saw a production decrease of 12 per year Vertical turbine designs have much lower efficiency than standard horizontal designs Types Wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis the former being both older and more common They can also include blades transparent or not or be bladeless Vertical designs produce less power and are less common Horizontal axis Horizontalaxis wind turbines HAWT have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower and must be pointed into the wind Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servo motor Most have a gearbox which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator Since a tower produces turbulence behind it the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower Turbine blades are made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds Additionally the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount Downwind machines have been built despite the problem of turbulence mast wake because they dont need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind and because in high winds the blades can be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance Since cyclical that is repetitive turbulence may lead to fatigue failures most HAWTs are of upwind design Turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually threebladed and pointed into the wind by computercontrolled motors These have high tip speeds of over 320 kmh 200 mph high efficiency and low torque ripple which contribute to good reliability The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from 20 to 40 meters 66 to 131 ft or more The tubular steel towers range from 60 to 90 meters 200 to 300 ft tall The blades rotate at 10 to 22 revolutions per minute At 22 rotations per minute the tip speed exceeds 90 meters per second 300 fts A gear box is commonly used for stepping up the speed of the generator although designs may also use direct drive of an annular generator Some models operate at constant speed but more energy can be collected by variablespeed turbines which use a solidstate power converter to interface to the transmission system All turbines are equipped with protective features to avoid damage at high wind speeds by feathering the blades into the wind which ceases their rotation supplemented by brakes Year by year the size and height of turbines increase Offshore wind turbines are built up to 8MW today and have a blade length up to 80m Onshore wind turbines are installed in low wind speed areas and getting higher and higher towers Usual towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70 m to 120 m and in extremes up to 160 m with blade tip speeds reaching 80 ms to 90 ms Higher tip speeds means more noise and blade erosion Vertical axis Verticalaxis wind turbines or VAWTs have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically One advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable Also the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the groundbased gearbox improving accessibility for maintenance However these designs produce much less energy averaged over time which is a major drawback The key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train the inherently lower power coefficient the 360degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype When a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine If the height of a rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50 of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence Wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress Subtypes of the vertical axis design include Another type of vertical axis is the Parallel turbine which is similar to the crossflow fan or centrifugal fan It uses the ground effect Vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years a unit producing 10 kW was built by Israeli wind pioneer Bruce Brill in the 1980s Design and construction Main article Wind turbine design Wind turbines are designed to exploit the wind energy that exists at a location Aerodynamic modeling is used to determine the optimum tower height control systems number of blades and blade shape Wind turbines convert wind energy to electricity for distribution Conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components The rotor component which is approximately 20 of the wind turbine cost includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy The generator component which is approximately 34 of the wind turbine cost includes the electrical generator the control electronics and most likely a gearbox eg planetary gearbox adjustablespeed drive or continuously variable transmission component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity The structural support component which is approximately 15 of the wind turbine cost includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism A 15 MW wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the United States has a tower 80 meters 260 ft high The rotor assembly blades and hub weighs 22000 kilograms 48000 lb The nacelle which contains the generator component weighs 52000 kilograms 115000 lb The concrete base for the tower is constructed using 26000 kilograms 58000 lb of reinforcing steel and contains 190 cubic meters 250 cu yd of concrete The base is 15 meters 50 ft in diameter and 24 meters 8 ft thick near the center Among all renewable energy systems wind turbines have the highest effective intensity of powerharvesting surface because turbine blades not only harvest wind power but also concentrate it Unconventional designs Main article Unconventional wind turbines An E66 wind turbine in the Windpark Holtriem Germany has an observation deck for visitors Another turbine of the same type with an observation deck is located in Swaffham England Airborne wind turbine designs have been proposed and developed for many years but have yet to produce significant amounts of energy In principle wind turbines may also be used in conjunction with a large vertical solar updraft tower to extract the energy due to air heated by the sun Wind turbines which utilise the Magnus effect have been developed A ram air turbine RAT is a special kind of small turbine that is fitted to some aircraft When deployed the RAT is spun by the airstream going past the aircraft and can provide power for the most essential systems if there is a loss of all onboard electrical power as in the case of the Gimli Glider The twobladed SCD 6MW offshore turbine designed by aerodyn Energiesysteme and built by MingYang Wind Power has a helideck for helicopters on top of its nacelle The prototype was erected in 2014 in Rudong China Turbine monitoring and diagnostics See also Wind turbine prognostics Due to data transmission problems structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to the nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipments Currently digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects Dynamic characteristics of nonrotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines Materials and durability Materials that are typically used for the rotor blades in wind turbines are composites as they tend to have a high stiffness high strength high fatigue resistance and low weight Typical resins used for these composites include polyester and epoxy while glass and carbon fibers have been used for the reinforcing material Construction may use manual layup techniques or composite resin injection molding As the price of glass fibers is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber glass fiber is still dominant As competition in the wind market increases companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters and thus blade length Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a systemlevel redesign By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems manufacturers may increase the length of the blades without increasing their overall weight For instance the spar cap a structural element of a turbine blade commonly experiences high tensile loading making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner lighter blades offering equivalent performance In a 10MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tonnes when fabricated out of glass fiber A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent or approximately 15 metric tonnes The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber It is therefore not economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components While the material cost is significantly higher for allglass fiber blades than for hybrid glasscarbon fiber blades there is a potential for tremendous savings in manufacturing costs when labor price is considered Utilizing carbon fiber enables for simpler designs that use less raw material The chief manufacturing process in blade fabrication is the layering of plies By reducing the number of layers of plies as is enabled by thinner blade design the cost of labor may be decreased and in some cases equate to the cost of labor for glass fiber blades Materials for wind turbine parts other than the rotor blades including the rotor hub gearbox frame and tower are largely composed of steel Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators cables and such Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components in an effort to make the turbines more lightweight and efficient and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower but still requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine Additionally stepup gear boxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines In particular this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals 96 in 2009 and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials In recent years however other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale Wind turbines on public display Main article Wind turbines on public display A few localities have exploited the attentiongetting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display either with visitor centers around their bases or with viewing areas farther away The wind turbines are generally of conventional horizontalaxis threebladed design and generate power to feed electrical grids but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration public relations and education Small wind turbines Main article Small wind turbine Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on or offgrid residences telecom towers offshore platforms rural schools and clinics remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid or where the grid is unstable Small wind turbines may be as small as a fiftywatt generator for boat or caravan use Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage particularly in rural locations as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point The US Department of Energys National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts Small units often have direct drive generators direct current output aeroelastic blades lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind Larger more costly turbines generally have geared power trains alternating current output flaps and are actively pointed into the wind Direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched Wind turbine spacing On most horizontal windturbine farms a spacing of about 6–10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld However for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economically optimal taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs This conclusion has been reached by research conducted by Charles Meneveau of the Johns Hopkins University and Johan Meyers of Leuven University in Belgium based on computer simulations that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines wakes as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer Moreover recent research by John Dabiri of Caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighbouring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another Operability Maintenance Wind turbines need regular maintenance to stay reliable and available reaching 98 Modern turbines usually have a small onboard crane for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components However large heavy components like generator gearbox blades and so on are rarely replaced and a heavy lift external crane is needed in those cases If the turbine has a difficult access road a containerized crane can be lifted up by the internal crane to provide heavier lifting Repowering Main article Repowering Installation of new wind turbines can be controversial An alternative is repowering where existing wind turbines are replaced with bigger more powerful ones sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity Demolition Older turbines were in some early cases not required to be removed when reaching the end of their life Some still stand waiting to be recycled or repowered A demolition industry develops to recycle offshore turbines at a cost of DKK 2–4 million per MW to be guaranteed by the owner Records See also Renewable energy portal Sustainable
