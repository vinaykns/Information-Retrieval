enterprises are headquartered in the state for example Daimler AG Porsche Robert Bosch GmbH automobile industry Carl Zeiss AG optics and SAP SE largest software enterprise in Europe and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen precision mechanical engineering In spite of this BadenWürttembergs economy is dominated by small and mediumsized enterprises Although poor in workable natural resources formerly lead zinc iron silver copper and salts and still rural in many areas the region is heavily industrialised In 2003 there were almost 8800 manufacturing enterprises with more than 20 employees but only 384 with more than 500 The latter category accounts for 43 of the 12 million persons employed in industry The Mittelstand or midsized company is the backbone of the BadenWürttemberg economy Mediumsized

great adaptability of the regions economy has generally helped it through crises Half of the employees in the manufacturing industry are in mechanical and electrical engineering and automobile construction This is also where the largest enterprises are to be found The importance of the precision mechanics industry also extends beyond the regions borders as does that of the optical clock making toy metallurgy and electronics industries The textile industry which formerly dominated much of the region has now all but disappeared from BadenWürttemberg Research and development RD is
