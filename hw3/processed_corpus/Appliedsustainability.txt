 Applied sustainability is the application of science and innovation including the insights of the social sciences to meet human needs while indefinitely preserving the life support systems of the planet Note that this is a significant difference from the standard definition of sustainability that normally is encapsulated by some version of the Brundtland Commissions concept “development that meets the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” Just applied sustainability A more refined definition would be called just applied sustainability the just and equitable application of science and innovation including the social sciences to ensure a better quality of life for all now and into the future whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems This comes from the definition of Just Sustainability which is “the egalitarian conception of sustainable developmentJacobs 199932 It generates an improved definition of sustainable development as “the need to ensure a better quality of life for all now and into the future in a just and equitable manner whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems” Agyeman et al 20035 This new form of sustainable development prioritizes justice and equity while maintaining the importance of the environment and the global life support system Synonymous with applied science The relationship between applied sustainability and sustainability or sustainability science is analogous relationship between applied science engineering and basic science Whereas science is the effort to discover understand or to understand better how the physical world works with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding Applied science is the application of knowledge from one or more natural scientific fields to solve practical problems Sustainable engineering Applied sustainability is essentially sustainable engineering – by utilizing natural laws and physical resources in order to design and implement materials structures machines devices systems and processes that meets human need while preserving the environment forever Applied sustainability is made up of work in engineering policy and education – whatever methods are necessary to conserve the world for our children A recent study has shown that open source principles can be used to accelerate deployment of sustainable technologies such as open source appropriate technologies Clarification regarding terminology Sustainability itself is a term that is often confused because in its most basic form it is a characteristic of a process or state that can be maintained at a certain level indefinitely When used in the context of development as sustainable development it is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present but in the indefinite future The most evolved definition of sustainability is that of just sustainability “the need to ensure a better quality of life for all now and into the future in a just and equitable manner whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems” See also Sustainable Development portal Environment portal Earth sciences portal Ecology portal Renewable Energy portal Energy portal Appropedia Circles of Sustainability Engaged Research References External links Circles of Sustainability Practical Tools for Creating Sustainable Cities and Communities A Closer Look at Applied Sustainability Centers Applied Sustainability Research Group at Queens University Applied Sustainability Finding your Niche Resource Conservation Manitoba The Applied Sustainability Center The Centre for Rural Sustainability York Centre for Applied Sustainability
