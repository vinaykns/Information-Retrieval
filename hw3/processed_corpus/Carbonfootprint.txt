 A carbon footprint is historically defined as the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual event organisation product expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent The total carbon footprint cannot be calculated because of the large amount of data required and the fact that carbon dioxide can be produced by natural occurrences It is for this reason that Wright Kemp and Williams writing in the journal Carbon Management have suggested a more practicable definition Greenhouse gases GHGs can be emitted through transport land clearance and the production and consumption of food fuels manufactured goods materials wood roads buildings and services For simplicity of reporting it is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent of other GHGs emitted Most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average US household come from indirect sources ie fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final consumer These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in ones car or stove commonly referred to as direct sources of the consumers carbon footprint The concept name of the carbon footprint originates from ecological footprint discussion which was developed by Rees and Wackernagel in the 1990s which estimates the number of earths that would theoretically be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint However given that ecological footprints are a measure of failure Anindita Mitra CREA Seattle chose the more easily calculated carbon footprint to easily measure use of carbon as an indicator of unsustainable energy use In 2007 carbon footprints was used as a measure of carbon emissions to develop the energy plan for City of Lynnwood Washington Carbon footprints are much more specific than ecological footprints since they measure direct emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere Carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators which also includes water footprint and land footprint Measuring carbon footprints An individuals nations or organizations carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment or other calculative activities denoted as carbon accounting Once the size of a carbon footprint is known a strategy can be devised to reduce it eg by technological developments better process and product management changed Green Public or Private Procurement GPP carbon capture consumption strategies carbon offsetting and others Several free online carbon footprint calculators exist including a few supported by publicly available peerreviewed data and calculations including the University of California Berkeleys CoolClimate Network research consortium and CarbonStory These websites ask you to answer more or less detailed questions about your diet transportation choices home size shopping and recreational activities usage of electricity heating and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators and so on The website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individualhousehold carbon footprints This review identified 13 calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the 15 most popular online carbon footprint calculators A recent study’s results by Carnegie Mellons Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production shipment and previous technology used to make that product can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint It is important to question and address the accuracy of Carbon Footprint techniques especially due to its overwhelming popularity Carbon Footprints can be reduced through the development of alternative projects such as solar and wind energy which are environment friendly renewable resources or reforestation the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted These examples are known as Carbon Offsetting the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere The main influences on carbon footprints include population economic output and energy and carbon intensity of the economy These factors are the main targets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints Production creates a large carbon footprint scholars suggest that decreasing the amount of energy needed for production would be one of the most effective ways to decrease a carbon footprint This is due to the fact that Electricity is responsible for roughly 37 of Carbon Dioxide emissions Coal production has been refined to greatly reduce carbon emissions since the 1980s the amount of energy used to produce a ton of steel has decreased by 50 Average carbon emissions per person by country Main article List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita The average US household carbon footprint is about 50 tons CO2e per year The single largest source of emissions for the typical household is from driving gasoline use Transportation as a whole driving flying small amount from public transit is the largest overall category followed by housing electricity natural gas waste construction then food mostly from red meat dairy and seafood products but also includes emissions from all other food then goods followed lastly by services The carbon footprint of US households is about 5 times greater than the global average which is approximately 10 tons CO2e per household per year For most US households the single most important action to reduce their carbon footprint is driving less or switching to a more efficient vehicle Direct carbon emissions The carbon footprint of energy Main article Lifecycle greenhousegas emissions of energy sources The following table compares from peerreviewed studies of full life cycle emissions and from various other studies the carbon footprint of various forms of energy generation nuclear hydro coal gas solar cell peat and wind generation technology Note 36 MJ megajoules 1 kW·h kilowatthours thus 1 gMJ 36 gkW·h

WL  Light Water Reactors WH  Heavy Water Reactors Educated estimate These three studies thus concluded that hydroelectric wind and nuclear power produced the least CO2 per kilowatthour of any other electricity sources These figures do not allow for emissions due to accidents or terrorism Wind power and solar power emit no carbon from the operation but do leave a footprint during construction phase and maintenance during operation Hydropower from reservoirs also has large footprints from initial removal of vegetation and ongoing methane stream detritus decays anaerobically to methane in bottom of reservoir rather than aerobically to CO2 if it had stayed in an unrestricted stream The table above gives the carbon footprint per kilowatthour of electricity generated which is about half the worlds manmade CO2 output The CO2 footprint for heat is equally significant and research shows that using waste heat from power generation in combined heat and power district heating chpdh has the lowest carbon footprint much lower than micropower or heat pumps Passenger transport This section gives representative figures for the carbon footprint of the fuel burned by different transport types not including the carbon footprints of the vehicles or related infrastructure themselves The precise figures vary according to a wide range of factors Flight Main article Environmental impact of aviation Some representative figures for CO2 emissions are provided by LIPASTOs survey of average direct emissions not accounting for highaltitude radiative effects of airliners expressed as CO2 and CO2 equivalent per passenger kilometre Domestic short distance less than 463 km 288 mi 257 gkm CO2 or 259 gkm 147 ozmile CO2e Long distance flights 113 gkm CO2 or 114 gkm 65 ozmile CO2e However emissions per unit distance traveled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint not the merely rate of emissions For example a greatly more distant holiday destination may be chosen than if another mode of travel were used because air travel makes the longer distance feasible in the limited time available Road CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre pkm for all road travel for 2011 in Europe as provided by the European Environment Agency 109 gpkm CO2 Figure 2 For vehicles average figures for CO2 emissions per kilometre for road travel for 2013 in Europe normalized to the NEDC test cycle are provided by the International Council on Clean Transportation Newly registered passenger cars 127 gkm CO2 Hybridelectric vehicles 92 gkm CO2 Light commercial vehicles LCV 175 gkm CO2 Average figures for the United States are provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency based on the EPA Federal Test Procedure for the following categories Passenger cars 322 gmi 200 gkm CO2 Trucks 450 gmi 280 gkm CO2 Combined 369 gmi 229 gkm CO2 Rail In 2005 the US company Amtraks carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per passenger kilometre were 0116 kg about twice as high as the UK rail average where much more of the system is electrified and about eight times a Finnish electric intercity train Sea Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passengerkilometre seem to be 012 kg 42 oz However 18knot ferries between Finland and Sweden produce 0221 kg 78 oz of CO2 with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of 0223 kg 79 oz while 24–27knot ferries between Finland and Estonia produce 0396 kg 140 oz of CO2 with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of 04 kg 14 oz Indirect carbon emissions the carbon footprints of products Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products The US Environmental Protection Agency has addressed paper plastic candy wrappers glass cans computers carpet and tires Australia has addressed lumber and other building materials Academics in Australia Korea and the US have addressed paved roads Companies nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages Carnegie Mellon University has estimated the CO2 footprints of 46 large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries Carnegie Mellon Sweden and the Carbon Trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods shirts and detergents introducing a CO2 label in March 2007 The label is intended to comply with a new British Publicly Available Specification ie not a standard PAS 2050 and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27000 certifiable product carbon footprints Evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item For example a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton a beer can is made of aluminum and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic The larger the size the larger the footprint will be Food Main article Low carbon diet In a 2014 study by Scarborough et al the reallife diets of British people were surveyed and their dietary greenhouse gas footprints estimated Average dietary greenhousegas emissions per day in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent were 719 for high meateaters 563 for medium meateaters 467 for low meateaters 391 for fisheaters 381 for vegetarians 289 for vegans Textiles The precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors However studies of textile production in Europe suggest the following carbon dioxide equivalent emissions footprints per kilo of texile at the point of purchase by a consumer Cotton 7 Nylon 543 PET eg synthetic fleece 555 Wool 548 Accounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones Materials The carbon footprint of materials also known as embodied carbon varies widely The carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the Inventory of Carbon Energy database the GREET databases and models and LCA databases via openLCA Nexus Cement Cement production and carbon footprint resulting from soil sealing was 80 Mg person of total per capita CO2 emissions Italy year 2003 the balance between C loss due to soil sealing and C stocked in manmade infrastructures resulted in a net loss to the atmosphere 06 Mg C ha y Schemes to reduce carbon emissions Kyoto Protocol carbon offsetting and certificates Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and the emissions of other GHGs are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels like natural gas crude oil and coal While this is harmful to the environment carbon offsets can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects The Kyoto Protocol defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol Accordingly from an economic or market perspective one has to distinguish between a mandatory market and a voluntary market Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates Certified Emission Reduction CER Emission Reduction Unit ERU Verified Emission Reduction VER Mandatory market mechanisms To reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol with the least economical costs the following flexible mechanisms were introduced for the mandatory market Clean Development Mechanism CDM Joint Implementation JI Emissions trading The CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments while Emissions Trading allows those instruments to be sold on international markets Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate Certified Emissions Reductions CERs Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate Emission Reduction Units ERUs The CERs and ERUs can then be sold through Emissions Trading The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes Nations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter Emissions Trading to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries If the rules of a scheme allow the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through Emissions Trading While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the Kyoto Protocol itself they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs stimulating Emissions Trading and setting a market price for emissions A wellknown mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme EU ETS New changes are being made to the trading schemes The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is set to make some new changes within the next year The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union Other nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few year These nations include China India and the United States Voluntary market mechanisms In contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions A solution comparable with those developed for the mandatory market has been developed for the voluntary market the Verified Emission Reductions VER This measure has the great advantage that the projectsactivities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDMJI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO As such high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality However at present VERs can not be used in the mandatory market The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter OTC market The Chicago Climate Exchange is a voluntary yet legally binding capandtrade emission scheme whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres as well as special events that want to go carbon neutral Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference There are project developers wholesalers brokers and retailers as well as carbon funds in the voluntary market Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain—from project developer to retailer While some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects these projects flourish in the voluntary markets A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects However others note the community cobenefits that forestry projects foster Project types in the voluntary market range from avoided deforestation afforestationreforestation industrial gas sequestration increased energy efficiency fuel switching methane capture from coal plants and livestock and even renewable energy Renewable Energy Certificates RECs sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to additionality concerns Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market The size and activity of the voluntary carbon market is difficult to measure The most comprehensive report on the voluntary carbon markets to date was released by Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance in July 2007 ÆON of Japan is firstly approved by Japanese authority to indicate carbon footprint on three private brand goods in October 2009 Ways to reduce carbon footprint The most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to Reduce Reuse Recycle Refuse In manufacturing this can be done by recycling the packing materials by selling the obsolete inventory of one industry to the industry who is looking to buy unused items at lesser price to become competitive Nothing should be disposed off into the soil all the ferrous materials which are prone to degrade or oxidize with time should be sold as early as possible at reduced price This can also be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones If that option isnt available it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use When one household recycles at least half of their household waste they can save 12 tons of carbon dioxide annually Another easy option is to drive less By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving not only is a person going to save money on gas but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere However if walking is not an option one can look into carpooling or mass transportation options in their area Yet another option for reducing the carbon footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home By adding insulation to the walls and attic of ones home and installing weather stripping or caulking around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent Similarly one can very inexpensively upgrade the insulation clothing worn by residents of the home For example its estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear top and bottom made from a lightweight super insulating fabric like microfleece aka Polartec® Capilene® can conserve as much body heat as a full set of clothing allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5 °C These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day and keep temperatures moderate at all times Setting the thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about 1 ton of carbon dioxide each year Choice of diet is a major influence on a persons carbon footprint Animal sources of protein especially red meat rice typically produced in high methaneemitting paddies foods transported long distance andor via fuelinefficient transport eg highly perishable produce flown long distance and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet Scientists at the University of Chicago have estimated that the average American diet – which derives 28 of its calories from animal foods – is responsible for approximately one and a half more tonnes of greenhouse gasses – as CO2 equivalents – per person per year than a fully plantbased or vegan diet Their calculations suggest that even replacing one third of the animal protein in the average Americans diet with plant protein eg beans grains can reduce the diets carbon footprint by half a tonne Exchanging two thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius Finally throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or households footprint it adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas methane The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions to reduce ones carbon footprint and increase their handprint Furthermore the carbon footprint in the food industry can be reduced by optimizing the supply chain A life cycle or supply chain carbon footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify critical areas for improvement and provides a focus Such studies also demonstrate a company’s commitment to reducing carbon footprint now ahead of other competitors as well as preparing companies for potential regulation In addition to increased market advantage and differentiation ecoefficiency can also help to reduce costs where alternative energy systems are implemented GHG footprint The GHG footprint or greenhouse gas footprint refers to the amount of GHG that are emitted during the creation of products or services It is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint which measures only carbon dioxide one of many greenhouse gases One of methodologies used for the estimation of GHG footprint is Life Cycle Assessment LCA A life cycle assessment assesses multiple environmental impact categories typically including categories assessing the human health ecosystem and resources impacts from cradle to grave raw material
