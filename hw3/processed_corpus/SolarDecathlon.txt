generation of builtenvironment professionals Scope of contests Like the Olympic decathlon the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon consists of 10 contests The contests evaluate costeffective design innovation balanced with market potential water and energy efficiency energy production and timeofuse energy and communications strategies Each Solar Decathlon contest is worth a maximum of 100 points for a potential competition total of 1000 points Teams earn points through task completion performance monitoring and jury evaluation Contest 1 Architecture For the Architecture Contest of the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 teams are required to design and build attractive highperformance houses that integrate solar and energy efficiency technologies seamlessly into the design Contest 2 Market Potential For the Market Potential Contest of the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 each team is required to design a primary residence for yearround occupancy for a specific target client of its choosing Contest 3 Engineering Solar Decathlon houses are marvels of engineering For the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 a jury of engineers will evaluate the engineering design and implementation of each teams house based on the following criteria Approach Design Efficiency Performance and Documentation Contest 4 Communications The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 teams must develop and implement communications strategies to engage their local communities provide free tours to visitors during the event in Denver and make an impact across the world through their digital presence and media outreach Contest 5 Innovation New for the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 the Innovation Contest encourages teams to take a thoughtful approach to innovation rather than being limited solely to offtheshelf solutions Other contests such as Market Potential provide further checks and balances to ensure innovative ideas are implemented within market realities Contest 6 Water Always ahead of their time past Solar Decathlon teams have consistently integrated water use and reuse strategies into their designs even though no points were awarded for this effort Now the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 is rewarding smart water solutions for the first time This new contest is important not only because water is a precious resource but also because water and energy are inextricably linked—it takes water to make the energy we use and it takes energy to treat and deliver the clean water we require Contest 7 Health and Comfort New for 2017 the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon Health and Comfort Contest combines new contest components with those from previous Solar Decathlon competitions Teams are challenged to build a house that minimizes the flow of cooled air in summer or heated air in winter to the outdoors operate heating and cooling systems that keep temperature and humidity steady all while maintaining healthy indoor air quality Contest 8 Appliances The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 Appliances Contest is designed to mimic the appliance use of an average US home Teams earn points for operating their refrigerator and freezer washing and drying laundry simulating cooking tasks and hot showers Contest 9 Home Life The Home Life Contest in the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 demonstrates whether or not a house is capable of being a home Teams are required to engage in a variety of activities just like real homeowners They share meals with friends and neighbors watch television use their computers and host games nights They even commute in an electric vehicle charged from the houses solar electric system Contest 10 Energy Contest The Energy Contest of the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2017 evaluates each teams energy production and a theoretical value to a utility of the energy they both contribute to and take from the Solar Decathlon electricity grid For energy production teams receive full points for producing at least as much energy as its house needs thus achieving a net energy consumption of zero during the competition The energy value component of the Energy Contest is designed to mimic the arrangement a consumer with a solarpowered house may have with a utility including a netmetering agreement and timeofuse electricity rates Competitors 2017 Teams selected for the Solar Decathlon 2017 competition to be held in Denver CO are Georgia Tech Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta GA Las Vegas University of
