a hydroelectric dam on the Paraná River located on the border between Brazil and Paraguay The name Itaipu was taken from an isle that existed near the construction site In the Guarani language Itaipu means the sounding stone Completed in 1984 it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries 15 km 93 mi north of the Friendship Bridge The project ranges from Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay in the south to Guaíra and Salto del Guairá in the north The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14 GW with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 metres 387 ft In 2016 the plant generated a record 1031 TWh supplying approximately 75 of the electricity consumed by Paraguay and 17 of that consumed by Brazil In 2016 the plant employed 3038 workers Of the twenty generator units currently installed ten generate at 50 Hz for Paraguay and ten generate at 60 Hz for Brazil Since the output capacity of the Paraguayan generators far exceeds the load in Paraguay most of their production is exported directly to the Brazilian side from where two 600 kV HVDC lines each approximately 800 kilometres 500 mi long carry the majority of the energy to the São PauloRio de Janeiro region where the terminal equipment converts the power to 60 Hz History Negotiations between Brazil and Paraguay The concept behind the Itaipu Power Plant was the result of serious negotiations between the two countries during the 1960s The Ata do Iguaçu Iguaçu Act was signed on July 22 1966 by the Brazilian and Paraguayan Ministers of Foreign Affairs Juracy Magalhães and Raúl Sapena Pastor respectively This was a joint declaration of the mutual interest in studying the exploitation of the hydro resources that the two countries shared in the section of the Paraná River starting from and including the Salto de Sete Quedas to the Iguaçu River watershed The Treaty that gave origin to the power plant was signed in 1973 The terms of the treaty which expires in 2023 have been the subject of widespread discontent in Paraguay The government of President Lugo vowed to renegotiate the terms of the treaty with Brazil which long remained hostile to any renegotiation In 2009 Brazil agreed to a fairer payment of electricity to Paraguay and also allowed Paraguay to sell excess power directly to Brazilian companies instead of solely through the Brazilian electricity monopoly Construction starts In 1970 the consortium formed by the companies IECO from the United States and ELC Electroconsult SpA from Italy won the international competition for the realization of the viability studies and for the elaboration of the construction project Design studies began in February 1971 On April 26 1973 Brazil and Paraguay signed the Itaipu Treaty the legal instrument for the hydroelectric exploitation of the Paraná River by the two countries On May 17 1974 the Itaipu Binacional entity was created to administer the plants construction The construction began in January of the following year Brazils and Latin Americas first electric car was introduced in late 1974 it received the name Itaipu in honor of the project Paraná River rerouted On October 14 1978 the Paraná River had its route changed which allowed a section of the riverbed to dry so the dam could be built there Agreement by Brazil Paraguay and Argentina An important diplomatic settlement was reached with the signing of the Acordo Tripartite by Brazil Paraguay and Argentina on October 19 1979 This agreement established the allowed river levels and how much they could change as a result of the various hydroelectrical undertakings in the watershed that was shared by the three countries At that time the three countries were ruled by military dictatorships Argentina was concerned that in the event of a conflict Brazil could open the floodgates raising the water level in the Río de la Plata and consequently flood the capital city of Buenos Aires Formation of the lake The reservoir began its formation on October 13 1982 when the dam works were completed and the side canals gates were closed Throughout this period heavy rains and flooding accelerated the filling of the reservoir as the water rose 100 meters 330 feet and reached the gates of the spillway at 1000 on October 27 Start of operations On May 5 1984 the first generation unit started running in Itaipu The first 18 units were installed at the rate of two to three a year the last two of these started running in the year 1991 Capacity expansion in 2007 The last two of the 20 electric generation units started operations in September 2006 and in March 2007 thus raising the installed capacity to 14 GW and completing the power plant This increase in capacity allows 18 generation units to run permanently while two are shut down for maintenance Due to a clause in the treaty signed between Brazil Paraguay and Argentina the maximum number of generating units allowed to operate simultaneously cannot exceed 18 see the agreement section for more information The rated nominal power of each generating unit turbine and generator is 700 MW However because the head difference between reservoir level and the river level at the foot of the dam that actually occurs is higher than the designed head 118 m the power available exceeds 750 MW half of the time for each generator Each turbine generates around 700 MW by comparison all the water from the Iguaçu Falls would have the capacity to feed only two generators November 2009 power failure Main article 2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout On November 10 2009 transmission from the plant was completely disrupted possibly due to a storm damaging up to three highvoltage transmission lines Itaipu itself was not damaged This caused massive power outages in Brazil and Paraguay blacking out the entire country of Paraguay for 15 minutes and plunging Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo into darkness for more than 2 hours 50 million people were reportedly affected The blackout hit at 2213 local time It affected the southeast of Brazil most severely leaving São Paulo Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo completely without electricity Blackouts also swept through the interior of Rio Grande do Sul Santa Catarina Mato Grosso do Sul Mato Grosso the interior of Bahia and parts of Pernambuco energy officials said By 0030 power had been restored to most areas Wonder of the Modern World In 1994 the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Itaipu Dam as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World In 1995 the American magazine Popular Mechanics published the results Social and environmental impacts When construction of the dam began approximately 10000 families living beside the Paraná River were displaced because of construction The worlds largest waterfall by volume the Guaíra Falls was drowned by the newly formed Itaipu reservoir The Brazilian government liquidated the Guaíra Falls National Park and dynamited the submerged rock face where the falls had been facilitating safer navigation thus eliminating the possibility of restoring the falls in the future A few months before the reservoir was filled 80 people died when an overcrowded bridge overlooking the falls collapsed as tourists sought a last glimpse of the falls The Guaíra Falls was an effective barrier that separated freshwater species in the upper Paraná basin with its many endemics from species found below it and the two are recognized as different ecoregions After the falls disappeared many species formerly restricted to one of these areas have been able to invade the other causing problems typically associated with introduced species For example more than 30 fish species that formerly were restricted to the region below the falls have been able to invade the region above The American composer Philip Glass has written a symphonic cantata named Itaipu in honour of the structure The Santa Maria Ecological Corridor now connects the Iguaçu National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park Statistics Construction The course of the seventh biggest river in the world was shifted as were 50 million tons of earth and rock The amount of concrete used to build the Itaipu Power Plant would be enough to build 210 football stadiums the size of the Estádio do Maracanã The iron and steel used would allow for the construction of 380 Eiffel Towers The volume of excavation of earth and rock in Itaipu is 85 times greater than that of the Channel Tunnel and the volume of concrete is 15 times greater Around forty thousand people worked in the construction Itaipu is one of the most expensive objects ever built Generating station and dam The total length of the dam is 7235 metres 23737 ft The crest elevation is 225 metres 738 ft Itaipu is actually four dams joined together — from the far left an earth fill dam a rock fill dam a concrete buttress main dam and a concrete wing dam to the right The spillway has a length of 483 metres 1585 ft The maximum flow of Itaipus fourteen segmented spillways is 622 thousand cubic metres per second 220×10 cu fts into three skislope formed canals It is equivalent to 40 times the average flow of the nearby natural Iguaçu Falls The flow of two generators 700 cubic metres per second 25000 cu fts each is roughly equivalent to the average flow of the Iguaçu Falls 1500 cubic metres per second 53000 cu fts If Brazil were to use Thermal Power Generation to produce the electric power of Itaipu 434000 barrels 69000 m of petroleum would have to be burned every day The dam is 196 metres 643 ft high equivalent to a 65story building Though it is the seventh largest reservoir in size in Brazil the Itaipus reservoir has the best relation between electricity production and flooded area For the 14000 MW installed power 1350 square kilometres 520 sq mi were flooded The reservoirs for the hydroelectric power plants of Sobradinho Dam Tucuruí Dam Porto Primavera Dam Balbina Dam Serra da Mesa Dam and Furnas Dam are all larger than the one for Itaipu but have a smaller installed generating capacity The one with the next largest hydroelectric production Tucuruí has an installed capacity of 8000 MW while flooding 2430 km 938 sq mi of land Electricity is 55
