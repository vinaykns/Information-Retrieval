 The precautionary principle or precautionary approach to risk management states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is not harmful the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking that action The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision eg taking a particular course of action when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking The principle implies that there is a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk These protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result In some legal systems as in law of the European Union the application of the precautionary principle has been made a statutory requirement in some areas of law Regarding international conduct the first endorsement of the principle was in 1982 when the World Charter for Nature was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly while its first international implementation was in 1987 through the Montreal Protocol Soon after the principle integrated with many other legally binding international treaties such as the Rio Declaration and Kyoto Protocol Origins and theory The concept precautionary principle is generally considered to have arisen in English from a translation of the German term Vorsorgeprinzip in the 1980s The concepts underpinning the precautionary principle predate the terms inception For example the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary aphorisms such as an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure better safe than sorry and look before you leap The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the ancientmedical principle of first do no harm to apply to institutions and institutional decisionmaking processes rather than individuals In economics the Precautionary Principle has been analysed in terms of the effect on rational decisionmaking of the interaction of irreversibility and uncertainty Authors such as Epstein 1980 and Arrow and Fischer 1974 show that irreversibility of possible future consequences creates a quasioption effect which should induce a riskneutral society to favour current decisions that allow for more flexibility in the future Gollier et al 2000 conclude that more scientific uncertainty as to the distribution of a future risk – that is a larger variability of beliefs – should induce society to take stronger prevention measures today Formulations Many definitions of the precautionary principle exist Precaution may be defined as caution in advance caution practised in the context of uncertainty or informed prudence Two ideas lie at the core of the principle an expression of a need by decisionmakers to anticipate harm before it occurs Within this element lies an implicit reversal of the onus of proof under the precautionary principle it is the responsibility of an activityproponent to establish that the proposed activity will not or is very unlikely to result in significant harm the concept of proportionality of the risk and the cost and feasibility of a proposed action One of the primary foundations of the precautionary principle and globally accepted definitions results from the work of the Rio Conference or Earth Summit in 1992 The principle 15 of the Rio Declaration notes In order to protect the environment the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing costeffective measures to prevent environmental degradation The 1998 Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle summarises the principle this way When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically The Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle was convened by the Science and Environmental Health Network The 2 February 2000 Commission of the European Communities Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle noted that The precautionary principle is not defined in the Treaty which prescribes it the Precautionary Principle only once – to protect the environment But in practice its scope is much wider and specifically where preliminaryobjectivescientificevaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that potentially dangerous effects on the environment human animal or and plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection for what chosen for the Community The 29 January 2000 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety says in regard to controversies over GMOs Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information shall not prevent the Party of Import in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects from taking a decision as appropriate with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question Application The application of the precautionary principle is hampered by both lack of political will as well as the wide range of interpretations placed on it One study identified 14 different formulations of the principle in treaties and nontreaty declarations RB Stewart 2002 reduced the precautionary principle to four basic versions Scientific uncertainty should not automatically preclude regulation of activities that pose a potential risk of significant harm NonPreclusion PP Regulatory controls should incorporate a margin of safety activities should be limited below the level at which no adverse effect has been observed or predicted Margin of Safety PP Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be subject to best technology available requirements to minimise the risk of harm unless the proponent of the activity shows that they present no appreciable risk of harm BAT PP Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be prohibited unless the proponent of the activity shows that it presents no appreciable risk of harm Prohibitory PP In deciding how to apply the principle analysis may use a costbenefit analysis that factors in both the opportunity cost of not acting and the option value of waiting for further information before acting One of the difficulties of the application of the principle in modern policymaking is that there is often an irreducible conflict between different interests so that the debate necessarily involves politics Strong vs weak Strong precaution holds that regulation is required whenever there is a possible risk to health safety or the environment even if the supporting evidence is speculative and even if the economic costs of regulation are high In 1982 the United Nations World Charter for Nature gave the first international recognition to the strong version of the principle suggesting that when potential adverse effects are not fully understood the activities should not proceed The widely publicised Wingspread Declaration from a meeting of environmentalists in 1998 is another example of the strong version Strong precaution can also be termed as a noregrets principle where costs are not considered in preventative action Weak precaution holds that lack of scientific evidence does not preclude action if damage would otherwise be serious and irreversible Humans practice weak precaution every day and often incur costs to avoid hazards that are far from certain we do not walk in moderately dangerous areas at night we exercise we buy smoke detectors we buckle our seatbelts According to a publication by the New Zealand Treasury Department The weak version of the Precautionary Principle is the least restrictive and allows preventive measures to be taken in the face of uncertainty but does not require them eg Rio Declaration 1992 United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change 1992 To satisfy the threshold of harm there must be some evidence relating to both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of consequences Some but not all require consideration of the costs of precautionary measures Weak formulations do not preclude weighing benefits against the costs Factors other than scientific uncertainty including economic considerations may provide legitimate grounds for postponing action Under weak formulations the requirement to justify the need for action the burden of proof generally falls on those advocating precautionary action No mention is made of assignment of liability for environmental harm Strong versions justify or require precautionary measures and some also establish liability for environmental harm which is effectively a strong form of polluter pays For example the Earth Charter states When knowledge is limited apply a precautionary approach Place the burden of proof on those who argue that a proposed activity will not cause significant harm and make the responsible parties liable for environmental harm Reversal of proof requires those proposing an activity to prove that the product process or technology is sufficiently safe before approval is granted Requiring proof of no environmental harm before any action proceeds implies the public is not prepared to accept any environmental risk no matter what economic or social benefits may arise Peterson 2006 At the extreme such a requirement could involve bans and prohibitions on entire classes of potentially threatening activities or substances Cooney 2005 Over time there has been a gradual transformation of the precautionary principle from what appears in the Rio Declaration to a stronger form that arguably by whom acts as restraint on development in the absence of firm evidence that it will do no harm International agreements and declarations The World Charter for Nature which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982 was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle The principle was implemented in an international treaty as early as the 1987 Montreal Protocol and among other international treaties and declarations is reflected in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development Principle vs approach No introduction to the precautionary principle would be complete without brief reference to the difference between the precautionary principle and the precautionary approach Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration 1992 states that in order to protect the environment the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall be not used as a reason for postponing costeffective measures to prevent environmental degradation As Garcia 1995 pointed out the wording largely similar to that of the principle is subtly different in that 1 it recognizes that there may be differences in local capabilities to apply the approach and 2 it calls for costeffectiveness in applying the approach eg taking economic and social costs into account The approach is generally considered a softening of the principle As Recuerda has noted the distinction between the precautionary principle and a precautionary approach is diffuse and in some contexts controversial In the negotiations of international declarations the United States has opposed the use of the term principle because this term has special connotations in legal language due to the fact that a principle of law is a source of law This means that it is compulsory so a court can quash or confirm a decision through the application of the precautionary principle In this sense the precautionary principle is not a simple idea or a desideratum but a source of law This is the legal status of the precautionary principle in the European Union On the other hand an approach usually does not have the same meaning although in some particular cases an approach could be binding A precautionary approach is a particular lens used to identify risk that every prudent person possesses Recuerda 2008 European Commission On 2 February 2000 the European Commission issued a Communication on the precautionary principle in which it adopted a procedure for the application of this concept but without giving a detailed definition of it Paragraph 2 of article 191 of the Lisbon Treaty states that Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay After the adoption of the European Commissions Communication on the precautionary principle the principle has come to inform much EU policy including areas beyond environmental policy As of 2006 it had been integrated into EU laws in matters such as general product safety the use of additives for use in animal nutrition the incineration of waste and the regulation of genetically modified organisms Through its application in case law it has become a general principle of EU law France In France the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the precautionary principle article 5 When the occurrence of any damage albeit unpredictable in the current state of scientific knowledge may seriously and irreversibly harm the environment public authorities shall with due respect for the principle of precaution and the areas within their jurisdiction ensure the implementation of procedures for risk assessment and the adoption of temporary measures commensurate with the risk involved in order to preclude the occurrence of such damage United States On 18 July 2005 the City of San Francisco passed a Precautionary Principle Purchasing ordinance which requires the city to weigh the environmental and health costs of its 600 million in annual purchases – for everything from cleaning supplies to computers Members of the Bay Area Working Group on the Precautionary Principle including the Breast Cancer Fund helped bring this to fruition Japan In 1997 Japan tried to use the consideration of the precautionary principle in a WTO SPS Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures case as Japans requirement to test each variety of agricultural products apples cherries peaches walnuts apricots pears plums and quinces for the efficacy of treatment against codling moths was challenged This moth is a pest that does not occur in Japan and whose introduction has the potential to cause serious damage The United States claimed that it was not necessary to test each variety of a fruit for the efficacy of the treatment and that this varietal testing requirement was unnecessarily burdensome Australia The most important Australian court case so far due to its exceptionally detailed consideration of the precautionary principle is Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council The Principle was summarised by reference to the NSW Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991 which itself provides a good definition of the principle If there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reasoning for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation In the application of the principle… decisions should be guided by i careful evaluation to avoid wherever practicable serious or irreversible damage to the environment and ii an assessment of riskweighted consequence of various options The most significant points of Justice Prestons decision are the following findings The principle and accompanying need to take precautionary measures is triggered when two prior conditions exist a threat of serious or irreversible damage and scientific uncertainty as to the extent of possible damage Once both are satisfied a proportionate precautionary measure may be taken to avert the anticipated threat of environmental damage but it should be proportionate The threat of serious or irreversible damage should invoke consideration of five factors the scale of threat local regional etc the perceived value of the threatened environment whether the possible impacts are manageable the level of public concern and whether there is a rational or scientific basis for the concern The consideration of the level of scientific uncertainty should involve factors which may include what would constitute sufficient evidence the level and kind of uncertainty and the potential to reduce uncertainty The principle shifts the burden of proof If the principle applies the burden shifts a decision maker must assume the threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage is… a reality and the burden of showing this threat… is negligible reverts to the proponent… The precautionary principle invokes preventative action the principle permits the taking of preventative measures without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of the threat become fully known The precautionary principle should not be used to try to avoid all risks The precautionary measures appropriate will depend on the combined effect of the degree of seriousness and irreversibility of the threat and the degree of uncertainty… the more significant and uncertain the threat the greater…the precaution required …measures should be adopted… proportionate to the potential threats Philippines A petition filed 17 May 2013 by environmental group Greenpeace Southeast Asia and farmerscientist coalition Masipag Magsasaka at Siyentipiko sa Pagpapaunlad ng Agrikultura asked the Appellate court to stop the planting of Bt eggplant in test fields saying the impacts of such an undertaking to the environment native crops and human health are still unknown The Court of Appeals granted the petition citing the precautionary principle stating when human activities may lead to threats of serious and irreversible damage to the environment that is scientifically plausible but uncertain actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish the threat Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration in June 2013 and on 20 September 2013 the Court of Appeals chose to uphold their May decision saying the bt talong field trials violate the peoples constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology The Supreme Court on 8 December 2015 permanently stopped the field testing for Bt Bacillus thuringiensis talong eggplant upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals which stopped the field trials for the genetically modified eggplant The court is the first in the world to adopt the precautionary principle regarding GMO products in its decision Corporate The Body Shop International a UKbased cosmetics company included the precautionary principle in their 2006 Chemicals Strategy Environment and health Fields typically concerned by the precautionary principle are the possibility of Global warming or abrupt climate change in general Extinction of species Introduction of new and potentially harmful products into the environment threatening biodiversity eg genetically modified organisms Threats to public health due to new diseases and techniques eg AIDS transmitted through blood transfusion Longterm effects of new technologies eg health concerns regarding radiation from cell phones and other electronics communications devices Persistent or acute pollution eg asbestos endocrine disruptors Food safety eg Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease Other new biosafety issues eg artificial life new molecules The precautionary principle is often applied to biological fields because changes cannot be easily contained and have the potential of being global The principle has less relevance to contained fields such as aeronautics where the few people undergoing risk have given informed consent eg a test pilot In the case of technological innovation containment of impact tends to be more difficult if that technology can selfreplicate Bill Joy emphasised the dangers of replicating genetic technology nanotechnology and robotic technology in his article in Wired Why the future doesnt need us though he does not specifically cite the precautionary principle The application of the principle can be seen in the public policy of requiring pharmaceutical companies to carry out clinical trials to show that new medications are safe Oxford based philosopher Nick Bostrom discusses the idea of a future powerful superintelligence and the risks that weit face should it attempt to gain atomic level control of matter Application of the principle modifies the status of innovation and risk assessment it is not the risk that must be avoided or amended but a potential risk that must be prevented Thus in the case of regulation of scientific research there is a third party beyond the scientist and the regulator the consumer In an analysis concerning application of the precautionary principle to nanotechnology Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder posit that there are two forms of the principle which they call the strict form and the active form The former requires inaction when action might pose a risk while the latter means choosing less risky alternatives when they are available and taking responsibility for potential risks Thomas Alured Faunce has argued for stronger application of the precautionary principle by chemical and health technology regulators particularly in relation to Ti02 and ZnO nanoparticles in sunscreens biocidal nanosilver in waterways and products whose manufacture handling or recycling exposes humans to the risk of inhaling multiwalled carbon nanotubes Resource management Several natural resources like fish stocks are now managed by precautionary approach through Harvest Control Rules HCR based upon the precautionary principle The figure indicates how the principle is implemented in the cod fisheries management proposed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea In classifying endangered species the precautionary principle means that if there is doubt about an animals or plants exact conservation status the one that would cause the strongest protective measures to be realised should be chosen Thus a species like the silvery pigeon that might exist in considerable numbers and simply be underrecorded or might just as probably be long extinct is not classified as data deficient or extinct which both do not require any protective action to be taken but as critically endangered the conservation status that confers the need for the strongest protection whereas the increasingly rare but probably not yet endangered emerald starling is classified as data deficient because there is urgent need for research to clarify its status rather than for conservation action to save it from extinction If for example a large groundwater body that many people use for drinking water is contaminated by bacteria ecoli 0157 H7 campylobacter or leptospirosis and the source of contamination is strongly suspected to be dairy cows but the exact science is not yet able to provide absolute proof the cows should be removed from the environment until they are proved by the dairy industry not to be the source or until that industry ensures that such contamination will not recur Criticisms Critics of the principle use arguments similar to those against other formulations of technological conservatism Internal inconsistency – applying strong PP risks causing harm Strong formulations of the precautionary principle without regard to its most basic provisions that it is to be applied only where risks are potentially high AND not easily calculable applied to the principle itself as a policy decision may rule out its own use The reason suggested is that preventing innovation from coming to market means that only current technology may be used and current technology itself may cause harm or leave needs unmet there is a risk of causing harm by blocking innovation As Michael Crichton wrote in his novel State of Fear The precautionary principle properly applied forbids the precautionary principle For example forbidding nuclear power plants based on concerns about risk means continuing to rely on power plants that burn fossil fuels which continue to release greenhouse gases In another example the Hazardous Air Pollutant provisions in the 1990 amendments to the US Clean Air Act are an example of the Precautionary Principle where the onus is now on showing a listed compound is harmless Under this rule no distinction is made between those air Pollutants that provide a higher or lower risk so operators tend to choose lessexamined agents that are not on the existing list Blocking innovation and progress generally See also Fear uncertainty and doubt Because applications of strong formulations of the precautionary principle can be used to block innovation a technology which brings advantages may be banned by precautionary principle because of its potential for negative impacts leaving the positive benefits unrealised The precautionary principle has been ethically questioned on the basis that its application could block progress in developing countries Vagueness and plausibility The precautionary principle calls for inaction in the face of scientific uncertainty but some formulations do not specify the minimal threshold of plausibility of risk that acts as a triggering condition so that any indication that a proposed product or activity might harm health or the environment is sufficient to invoke the principle In Sancho vs DOE Helen Gillmor Senior District Judge wrote in a dismissal of Wagners lawsuit which included a popular worry that the LHC could cause destruction of the earth by a black hole See also References Other publications Kai Purnhagen The Behavioural Law and Economics of the Precautionary Principle in
