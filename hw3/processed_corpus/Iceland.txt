 This article is about the country For other uses see Iceland disambiguation Ísland redirects here For other uses see Island disambiguation Iceland ˈaɪslənd Icelandic Ísland pronounced ˈistlant is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean It has a population of 332529 and an area of 103000 km 40000 sq mi making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe The capital and largest city is Reykjavík Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over twothirds of the population Iceland is volcanically and geologically active The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields mountains and glaciers while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate According to Landnámabók the settlement of Iceland began in the year 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island In the following centuries Norwegians and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians immigrated to Iceland bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing one of the worlds oldest functioning legislative assemblies Following a period of civil strife Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway Denmark and Sweden Iceland thus followed Norways integration to that Union and came under Danish rule after Swedens secession from that union in 1523 Although the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550 Iceland remained a distant semicolonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence In the wake of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars Icelands struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 Until the 20th century Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture and was among the poorest in Europe Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world In 1994 it became a part of the European Economic Area which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance biotechnology and manufacturing Iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other OECD countries It maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens Iceland ranks high in economic political and social stability and equality In 2013 it was ranked as the 13th mostdeveloped country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index Iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy Affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis the nations entire banking system systemically failed in October 2008 leading to a severe depression substantial political unrest the Icesave dispute and the institution of capital controls Many bankers were jailed and the economy has made a significant recovery in large part due to a surge in tourism Icelandic culture is founded upon the nations Scandinavian heritage Most Icelanders are descendants of Germanic and Gaelic settlers Icelandic a North Germanic language is descended from Old Norse and is closely related to Faroese and West Norwegian dialects The countrys cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine Icelandic literature and medieval sagas Iceland has the smallest population of any NATO member and is the only one with no standing army its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence History Main articles History of Iceland and Timeline of Icelandic history Settlement and Commonwealth 874–1262 See also Settlement of Iceland Icelandic Commonwealth and Christianisation of Iceland According to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók Celtic monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived possibly members of a HibernoScottish mission Recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880 In 2016 archeologists uncovered a longhouse in Stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as the year 800 Swedish Viking explorer Garðar Svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island He stayed over winter and built a house in Húsavík Garðar departed the following summer but one of his men Náttfari decided to stay behind with two slaves Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of Iceland The NorwegianNorse chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson built his homestead in presentday Reykjavík in the year 874 Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers largely Scandinavians and their thralls many of whom were Irish or Scottish By 930 most arable land on the island had been claimed the Althing a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth Lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of Greenland starting in 986 The period of these early settlements coincided with the Medieval Warm Period when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century At this time about 25 of Iceland was covered with forest compared to 1 in the present day Christianity was adopted by consensus around 999–1000 although Norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwards The Middle Ages See also Age of the Sturlungs The Icelandic Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262 which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown Possession of Iceland passed from the Norwegian Empire to the Kalmar Union in 1415 when the kingdoms of Norway Denmark and Sweden were united After the breakup of the union in 1523 it remained a Norwegian dependency as a part of Denmark–Norway In the ensuing centuries Iceland became one of the poorest countries in Europe Infertile soil volcanic eruptions deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture The Black Death swept Iceland twice first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495 The former outbreak killed 50 to 60 of the population and the latter 30 to 50 Reformation and the Early Modern period See also Icelandic Reformation DanishIcelandic Trade Monopoly and Móðuharðindin Around the middle of the 16th century as part of the Protestant Reformation King Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects Jón Arason the last Catholic bishop of Hólar was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons The country subsequently became officially Lutheran and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion In the 17th and 18th centuries Denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on Iceland Natural disasters including volcanic eruption and disease contributed to a decreasing population Pirates from several countries including the Barbary Coast raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery A great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population In 1783 the Laki volcano erupted with devastating effects In the years following the eruption known as the Mist Hardships Icelandic Móðuharðindin over half of all livestock died in the country Around a quarter of the population died in the ensuing famine Independence movement 1814–1918 See also Icelandic independence movement and Fjölnir journal In 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars DenmarkNorway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel but Iceland remained a Danish dependency Throughout the 19th century the countrys climate continued to grow colder resulting in mass emigration to the New World particularly to the region of Gimli Manitoba in Canada which was sometimes referred to as New Iceland About 15000 people emigrated out of a total population of 70000 A national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland Europe An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of Jón Sigurðsson based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the Fjölnismenn and other Danisheducated Icelandic intellectuals In 1874 Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule This was expanded in 1904 and Hannes Hafstein served as the first Minister for Iceland in the Danish cabinet Kingdom of Iceland 1918–1944 See also Kingdom of Iceland Invasion of Iceland and Iceland in World War II The Danish–Icelandic Act of Union an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25 years recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with Denmark The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark handle Icelandic foreign policy Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the Kingdom of Iceland During World War II Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality After the German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940 the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by Denmark A month later British armed forces invaded and occupied the country violating Icelandic neutrality In 1941 the occupation was taken over by the United States so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere Independent republic 1944–present See also Founding of the Republic of Iceland Iceland in the Cold War and Cod Wars On 31 December 1943 the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union expired after 25 years Beginning on 20 May 1944 Icelanders voted in a fourday plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark abolish the monarchy and establish a republic The vote was 97 to end the union and 95 in favour of the new republican constitution Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944 with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president In 1946 the Allied occupation force left Iceland The nation formally became a member of NATO on 30 March 1949 amid domestic controversy and riots On 5 May 1951 a defence agreement was signed with the United States American troops returned to Iceland as the Iceland Defence Force and remained throughout the Cold War The US withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006 Iceland had prospered during the war The immediate postwar period was followed by substantial economic growth driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the US Marshall Plan programme through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country at USD 209 with the warravaged Netherlands a distant second at USD 109 The 1970s were marked by the Cod Wars — several disputes with the United Kingdom over Icelands extension of its fishing limits to 200 miles offshore Iceland hosted a summit in Reykjavík in 1986 between United States President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament A few years later Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania as they broke away from the USSR Throughout the 1990s the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes To that end Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATOled interventions in Bosnia Kosovo and Iraq Iceland joined the European Economic Area in 1994 after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised International economic relations increased further after 2001 when Icelands newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of external debt contributing to a 32 increase in Icelands gross national income between 2002 and 2007 Economic boom and crisis Further information 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis and 2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests In the years 2003–2007 following the privatization of the banking sector under the government of Davíð Oddsson Iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887 with a net emigration of 5000 people in 2009 Icelands economy stabilised under the government of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and grew by 16 in 2012 Many Icelanders however have remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies The centreright Independence Party was returned to power in coalition with the Progressive Party in the 2013 elections Geography For more details on this topic see Geography of Iceland Iceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grímsey off the main islands northern coast The country lies between latitudes 63 and 68°N and longitudes 25 and 13°W Iceland is closer to continental Europe than to mainland North America thus the island is generally included in Europe for historical political cultural and practical reasons Geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates The closest body of land is Greenland 290 km 180 mi The closest bodies of land in Europe are the Faroe Islands 420 km 260 mi Jan Mayen Island 570 km 350 mi Shetland and the Outer Hebrides both about 740 km 460 mi and the Scottish mainland and Orkney both about 750 km 470 mi The mainland of Norway is about 970 km 600 mi away Iceland is the worlds 18th largest island and Europes secondlargest island after Great Britain The main island is 101826 km 39315 sq mi but the entire country is 103000 km 397685 sq mi in size of which 627 is tundra About 30 minor islands are in Iceland including the lightly populated Grímsey and the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago Lakes and glaciers cover 143 of its surface only 23 is vegetated The largest lakes are Þórisvatn reservoir 83–88 km 32–34 sq mi and Þingvallavatn 82 km 32 sq mi other important lakes include Lagarfljót and Mývatn Jökulsárlón is the deepest lake at 248 m 814 ft Geologically Iceland is part of the MidAtlantic Ridge a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust This part of the midocean ridge is located above a mantle plume causing Iceland to be subaerial above the surface of the sea The ridge marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American Plates and Iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge Many fjords punctuate Icelands 4970kmlong 3088mi coastline which is also where most settlements are situated The islands interior the Highlands of Iceland is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand mountains and lava fields The major towns are the capital city of Reykjavík along with its outlying towns of Kópavogur Hafnarfjörður and Garðabær nearby Reykjanesbær where the international airport is located and the town of Akureyri in northern Iceland The island of Grímsey on the Arctic Circle contains the northernmost habitation of Iceland whereas Kolbeinsey contains the northernmost point of Iceland Iceland has three national parks Vatnajökull National Park Snæfellsjökull National Park and Þingvellir National Park The country is considered a strong performer in environmental protection having been ranked 13th in Yale Universitys Environmental Performance Index of 2012 Iceland as seen from space on 29 January 2004 Suðureyri Norðfjörður The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull South of Iceland off the Ring Road looking north late afternoon in winter 2001 Geology Main article Geology of Iceland See also Iceland plume A geologically young land Iceland is located on both the Iceland hotspot and the MidAtlantic Ridge which runs right through it This location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes notably Hekla Eldgjá Herðubreið and Eldfell The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the islands population In addition the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterward and affected climates in other areas Iceland has many geysers including Geysir from which the English word is derived and the famous Strokkur which erupts every 8–10 minutes After a phase of inactivity Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000 Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often With the widespread availability of geothermal power and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity most residents have access to inexpensive hot water heating and electricity The island is composed primarily of basalt a lowsilica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in Hawaii Iceland however has a variety of volcanic types composite and fissure many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with about 30 active volcanic systems Surtsey one of the youngest islands in the world is part of Iceland Named after Surtr it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 November 1963 and 5 June 1968 Only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island On 21 March 2010 a volcano in Eyjafjallajökull in the south of Iceland erupted for the first time since 1821 forcing 600 people to flee their homes Additional eruptions on 14 April forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes The resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across Europe Another large eruption occurred on 21 May 2011 This time it was the Grímsvötn volcano located under the thick ice of Europes largest glacier Vatnajökull Grímsvötn is one of Icelands most active volcanoes and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull activity with ash and lava hurled 20 km 12 mi into the atmosphere creating a large cloud The highest elevation for Iceland is listed as 2110 m 6923 ft at Hvannadalshnúkur 64°00′N 16°39′W Climate Main article Climate of Iceland The climate of Icelands coast is subarctic The warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world Regions in the world with similar climates include the Aleutian Islands the Alaska Peninsula and Tierra del Fuego although these regions are closer to the equator Despite its proximity to the Arctic the islands coasts remain icefree through the winter Ice incursions are rare the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969 The climate varies between different parts of the island Generally speaking the south coast is warmer wetter and windier than the north The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country Lowlying inland areas in the north are the most arid Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south The highest air temperature recorded was 305 °C 869 °F on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast The lowest was −38 °C −364 °F on 22 January 1918 at Grímsstaðir and Möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland The temperature records for Reykjavík are 262 °C 792 °F on 30 July 2008 and −245 °C −121 °F on 21 January 1918 Biodiversity See also Whaling in Iceland and The Botany of Iceland Around 1300 species of insects are known in Iceland which is low compared with other countries over one million species have been described worldwide The only native land mammal when humans arrived was the Arctic fox which came to the island at the end of the ice age walking over the frozen sea On rare occasions bats have been carried to the island with the winds but they are not able to breed there Polar bears occasionally come over from Greenland but they are just visitors and no Icelandic populations exist No native or freeliving reptiles or amphibians are on the island Phytogeographically Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom Around threequarters of the island is barren of vegetation plant life consists mainly of grassland which is regularly grazed by livestock The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch Betula pubescens which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland along with aspens Populus tremula rowans Sorbus aucuparia common junipers Juniperus communis and other smaller trees mainly willows When the island was first settled it was extensively forested In the late 12th century Ari the Wise described it in the Íslendingabók as forested from mountain to sea shore Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin volcanic soils and limited species diversity The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber Deforestation climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion Today many farms have been abandoned Threequarters of Icelands 100000 square kilometres is affected by soil erosion 18000 km 6900 sq mi serious enough to make the land useless Only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees but the result does not compare to the original forests Some of the planted forests include introduced species The tallest tree in Iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in Kirkjubæjarklaustur it was measured at 252 m 83 ft in 2013 The animals of Iceland include the Icelandic sheep cattle chickens goats the sturdy Icelandic horse and the Icelandic Sheepdog all descendants of animals imported by Europeans Wild mammals include the Arctic fox mink mice rats rabbits and reindeer Polar bears occasionally visit the island travelling on icebergs from Greenland In June 2008 two polar bears arrived in the same month Marine mammals include the grey seal Halichoerus grypus and harbor seal Phoca vitulina Many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding Iceland and the fishing industry is a major part of Icelands economy accounting for roughly half of the countrys total exports Birds especially seabirds are an important part of Icelands animal life Puffins skuas and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs Commercial whaling is practised intermittently along with scientific whale hunts Whale watching has become an important part of Icelands economy since 1997 Politics Main article Politics of Iceland Iceland has a left–right multiparty system Following the 2013 parliamentary election the biggest parties are the centreright Independence Party Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn and the Progressive Party Framsóknarflokkurinn Other political parties with seats in the Althing are the centreleft Social Democratic Alliance Samfylkingin LeftGreen Movement Vinstrihreyfingin – grænt framboð Bright Future Björt framtíð and the Pirate Party of Iceland Píratar Many other parties exist on the municipal level most of which run only locally in a single municipality Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women Known as the Womens List or Womens Alliance Kvennalistinn it was founded in 1983 to advance the political economic and social needs of women After participating in its first parliamentary elections the Womens List helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15 Although it disbanded in 1999 merging with the Social Democratic Alliance it left a lasting influence on Icelands politics every major party has a 40 quota for women and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female compared to the global average of 16 In 2016 Iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions and 13th in government transparency The country has a high level of civic participation with 814 voter turnout during the most recent elections compared to an OECD average of 72 However only 50 of Icelanders say they trust their political institutions slightly less than the OECD average of 56 and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the Icelandic financial crisis Government See also Government of Iceland Iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic The modern parliament Alþingi English Althing was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch It was widely seen as a reestablishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799 Consequently it is arguably the worlds oldest parliamentary democracy It currently has 63 members elected for a maximum period of four years The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years with no term limit The elections for president the Althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years The president of Iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum The current president is Guðni Th Jóhannesson The head of government is the prime minister who together with the cabinet is responsible for executive government The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing however the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944 but in 1942 regent Sveinn Björnsson who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941 appointed a nonparliamentary government The regent had for all practical purposes the position of a president and Sveinn would later become the countrys first president in 1944 The governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments with two or more parties involved as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in Iceland several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently In 1980 Icelanders elected Vigdís Finnbogadóttir as president the worlds first directly elected female head of state She retired from office in 1996 In 2009 Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became prime minister Administrative divisions Main article Administrative divisions of Iceland Iceland is divided into regions constituencies and municipalities The eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes District court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division Until 2003 the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies The redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system but still exists 74 municipalities in Iceland govern local matters like schools transport and zoning These are the actual secondlevel subdivisions of Iceland as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes Reykjavík is by far the most populous municipality about four times more populous than Kópavogur the second one Regions of Iceland Constituencies of Iceland Municipalities of Iceland Foreign relations Main articles Foreign relations of Iceland and Accession of Iceland to the European Union Iceland which is a member of the UN NATO EFTA Council of Europe and OECD maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations but its ties with the Nordic countries Germany the United States Canada and the other NATO nations are particularly close Historically due to cultural economic and linguistic similarities Iceland is a Nordic country and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the Nordic Council Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area EEA which allows the country access to the single market of the European Union EU It was not a member of the EU but in July 2009 the Icelandic parliament the Althing voted in favour of application for EU membership and officially applied on 17 July 2009 However in 2013 opinion polls showed that many Icelanders were now against joining the EU following 2013 elections the two parties that formed the islands new government – the centrist Progressive Party and the rightwing Independence Party – announced they would hold a referendum on EU membership Military Main article Military of Iceland Iceland has no standing army but the Icelandic Coast Guard which also maintains the Iceland Air Defence System and a Iceland Crisis Response Unit to support peacekeeping missions perform paramilitary functions The Iceland Defense Force IDF was a military command of the United States Armed Forces from 1951 to 2006 The IDF created at the request of NATO came into existence when the United States signed an agreement to provide for the defense of Iceland The IDF also consisted of civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations The IDF was downsized after the end of the Cold War and the US Air Force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the Naval Air Station Keflavik until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006 Since May 2008 NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the Icelandic Air Policing mission Iceland supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite much domestic controversy deploying a Coast Guard EOD team to Iraq which was replaced later by members of the Iceland Crisis Response Unit Iceland has also participated in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia Despite the ongoing financial crisis the first new patrol ship in decades was launched on 29 April 2009 Icelanders remain especially proud of their role in hosting the historic 1986 Reagan–Gorbachev summit in Reykjavík which set the stage for the end of the Cold War Icelands principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights Conflict with the United Kingdom led to a series of socalled Cod Wars which included confrontations between the Icelandic Coast Guard and the Royal Navy over British fishermen in 1952–1956 due to the extension of Icelands fishing zone from 3 to 4 nmi 56 to 74 km 35 to 46 mi 1958–1961 following a further extension to 12 nmi 222 km 138 mi 1972–1973 with another extension to 50 nmi 926 km 575 mi and in 1975–1976 another extension to 200 nmi 3704 km 2302 mi According to the Global Peace Index Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world due to its lack of armed forces low crime rate and high level of sociopolitical stability Iceland is listed in Guinness Records Book as Country ranked most at peace and Lowest military spending per capita Economy Main article Economy of Iceland In 2007 Iceland was the seventh most productive country in the world per capita US54858 and the fifth most productive by GDP at purchasing power parity 40112 About 85 percent of total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources Utilization of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made Iceland the worlds largest electricity producer per capita As a result of its commitment to renewable energy the 2016 Global Green Economy Index ranked Iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world Historically Icelands economy depended heavily on fishing which still provides 40 of export earnings and employs 7 of the work force The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports fish and fish products aluminium and ferrosilicon Whaling in Iceland has been historically significant Iceland still relies heavily on fishing but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90 in the 1960s to 40 in 2006 Until the 20th century Iceland was among the poorest countries in Europe Currently it remains one of the most developed countries in the world Strong economic growth had led Iceland to be ranked first in the United Nations Human Development Index report for 20072008 although in 2011 its HDI rating had fallen to 14th place as a result of the economic crisis Nevertheless according to the Economist Intelligence Index of 2011 Iceland has the 2nd highest quality of life in the world Based on the Gini coefficient Iceland also has one of the lowest rates of income inequality in the world and when adjusted for inequality its HDI ranking climbs to 5th place Icelands unemployment rate has declined consistently since the crisis with 48 of the labour force being unemployed as of June 2012 compared to 6 in 2011 and 81 in 2010 Many political parties remain opposed to EU membership primarily due to Icelanders concern about losing control over their natural resources particularly fisheries The national currency of Iceland is the Icelandic króna ISK Nearly 70 of Icelanders have favoured the adoption of the Canadian dollar CAD – more than any other currency in the world A poll released on 5 March 2010 by Capacent Gallup showed that 31 of respondents were in favour of adopting the euro and 69 opposed Another Capacent Gallup poll conducted in February 2012 found that 674 of Icelanders would reject EU membership in a referendum Icelands economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade including software production biotechnology and finance industry accounts for around a quarter of economic activity while services comprise close to 70 The tourism sector is expanding especially in ecotourism and whalewatching On average Iceland receives around 11 million visitors annually which is more than three times the native population Icelands agriculture industry accounting for 54 of GDP consists mainly of potatoes green vegetables in greenhouses mutton and dairy products The financial centre is Borgartún in Reykjavík which hosts a large number of companies and three investment banks Icelands stock market the Iceland Stock Exchange ISE was established in 1985 Iceland is ranked 27th in the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom lower than in prior years but still among the freest in the world As of 2016 it ranks 29th in the World Economic Forums Global Competitive Index one place lower than in 2015 According to INSEADs Global Innovation Index Iceland is the 11th most innovative country in the world Unlike most Western European countries Iceland has a flat tax system the main personal income tax rate is a flat 2275 and combined with municipal taxes the total tax rate equals no more than 357 not including the many deductions that are available The corporate tax rate is a flat 18 one of the lowest in the world There is also a value added tax whereas a net wealth tax was eliminated in 2006 Employment regulations are relatively flexible and the labour market is one of the freest in the world Property rights are strong and Iceland is one of the few countries where they are applied to fishery management Like other welfare states taxpayers pay various subsidies to each other but with spending being less than in most European countries Despite low tax rates agricultural assistance is the highest among OECD countries and a potential impediment to structural change Also health care and education spending have relatively poor returns by OECD measures though improvements have been made in both areas The OECD Economic Survey of Iceland 2008 had highlighted Icelands challenges in currency and macroeconomic policy There was a currency crisis that started in the spring of 2008 and on 6 October trading in Icelands banks was suspended as the government battled to save the economy The latest assessment by the OECD determined that Iceland has made progress in many areas particularly in creating a sustainable fiscal policy and restoring the health of the financial sector however challenges remain in making the fishing industry more efficient and sustainable as well as in improving monetary policy to address inflation Icelands public debt has decreased since the economic crisis and as of 2015 is the 31th highest in the world by proportion of national GDP Economic contraction Main article 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis Iceland had been hit especially hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007 because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis Before the crash of the countrys three largest banks Glitnir Landsbanki and Kaupthing their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nations gross domestic product of €14 billion 19 billion In October 2008 the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks Icelandic officials including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks foreign debts or assets Instead new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy On 28 October 2008 the Icelandic government raised interest rates to 18 as of August 2010 it was 7 a move forced in part by the terms of acquiring a loan from International Monetary Fund IMF After the rate hike trading on the Icelandic króna finally resumed on the open market with valuation at around 250 ISK per Euro less than onethird the value of the 170 exchange rate during most of 2008 and a significant drop from the 1150 exchange ratio of the week before On 20 November 2008 the Nordic countries agreed to lend Iceland 25 billion On 26 January 2009 the coalition government collapsed due to the public dissent over the handling of the financial crisis A new leftwing government was formed a week later and immediately set about removing Central Bank governor Davíð Oddsson and his aides from the bank through changes in law Davíð was removed on 26 February 2009 in the wake of protests outside the Central Bank Thousands of Icelanders have moved from the country after the collapse and many of those moved to Norway In 2005 293 people moved from Iceland to Norway in 2009 the figure was 1625 In April 2010 the Icelandic Parliament‘s Special Investigation Commission published the findings of its investigation revealing the extent of control fraud in this crisis By June 2012 Landsbanki managed to repay about half of the Icesave debt According to Bloomberg Iceland is on the trajectory of 2 unemployment as a result of crisismanagement decisions made back in 2008 including allowing the banks to fail Transport Main article Transport in Iceland Iceland has a high level of car ownership per capita with a car for every 15 inhabitants it is the main form of transport Iceland has 13034 km 8099 mi of administered roads of which 4617 km 2869 mi are paved and 8338 km 5181 mi are not A great number of roads remain unpaved mostly littleused rural roads The road speed limits are 50 kmh 31 mph in towns 80 kmh 50 mph on gravel country roads and 90 kmh 56 mph on hardsurfaced roads Iceland currently has no railways Route 1 or the Ring Road Icelandic Þjóðvegur 1 or Hringvegur was completed in 1974 and is a main road that runs around Iceland and connects all the inhabited parts of the island with the interior of the island being uninhabited This paved road is 1332 km 828 mi long with one lane in each direction except near larger towns and cities and in the Hvalfjörður Tunnel also the site of a toll where it has more lanes Many bridges on it especially in the north and east are single lane and made of timber andor steel The main hub for international transport is Keflavík International Airport which serves Reykjavík and the country in general It is 48 km 30 mi to the west of Reykjavík Domestic flights flights to Greenland and the Faroe Islands and business flights operate mostly out of Reykjavík Airport which lies in the city centre Most general aviation traffic is also in Reykjavík There are 103 registered airports and airfields in Iceland most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas The biggest airport in Iceland is Keflavík International Airport and the biggest airfield is Geitamelur a fourrunway field around 100 km 62 mi east of Reykjavík dedicated exclusively to gliding There are a number of international airlines that fly to and from Iceland regularly Energy See also Renewable energy in Iceland Renewable sources—geothermal and hydropower—provide effectively all of Icelands electricity and around 85 of the nations total primary energy consumption with most of the remainder consisting of imported oil products used in transportation and in the fishing fleet Iceland expects to be energyindependent by 2050 Icelands largest geothermal power plants are Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir while Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant is the countrys largest hydroelectric power station When the Kárahnjúkavirkjun started operating Iceland became the worlds largest electricity producer per capita Icelanders emit 629 tonnes of CO2 in 2009 equivalent of greenhouse gases per capita Iceland is one of the few countries that have filling stations dispensing hydrogen fuel for cars powered by fuel cells It is also one of a few countries currently capable of producing hydrogen in adequate quantities at a reasonable cost because of Icelands plentiful renewable sources of energy On 22 January 2009 Iceland announced its first round of offshore licences for companies wanting to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and production in a region northeast of Iceland known as the Dreki area Two exploration licenses have been awarded In 2010 Iceland was noted by Guinness World Records as The Greenest Country reaching highest score by the Environmental Sustainability Index which measures a countrys water use biodiversity and adoption of clean energies with a score of 935100 As of 2012 the government of Iceland is in talks with the government of United Kingdom about the possibility of constructing a highvoltage directcurrent connector for transmission of electricity between the two countries Such a cable would give Iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in Iceland Iceland has considerable renewable energy resources especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources and most of the potential has not been developed partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of Iceland but the United Kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy and this could lead to further development of the energy resources Education and science See also Education in Iceland The Ministry of Education Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines However playschools primary schools and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities The government does allow citizens to Home educate their children however under a very strict set of demands Students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate Nursery school or leikskóli is noncompulsory education for children younger than six years and is the first step in the education system The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994 They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible Compulsory education or grunnskóli comprises primary and lower secondary education which often is conducted at the same institution Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16 years The school year lasts nine months beginning between 21 August and 1 September ending between 31 May and 10 June The minimum number of school days was once 170 but after a new teachers wage contract it increased to 180 Lessons take place five days a week All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity although an exemption may be considered by the Minister of Education Upper secondary education or framhaldsskóli follows lower secondary education These schools are also known as gymnasia in English Though not compulsory everyone who has had a compulsory education has the right to upper secondary education This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996 All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools The largest seat of higher education is the University of Iceland which has its main campus in central Reykjavík Other schools offering universitylevel instruction include Reykjavík University University of Akureyri Agricultural University of Iceland and Bifröst University An OECD assessment found 64 of Icelanders aged 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a highschool degree which is lower than the OECD average of 73 Among 25 to 34yearolds only 69 have earned the equivalent of a highschool degree significantly lower than the OECD average of 80 Nevertheless Icelands education system is considered excellent the Programme for International Student Assessment currently ranks it as the 16th best performing above the OECD average Students were particularly proficient in reading and mathematics According to a 2013 Eurostat report by the European Commission Iceland spends around 311 of its GDP on scientific research and development RD over 1 percentage point higher than the EU average of 203 and has set a target of 4 to reach by 2020 A 2010 UNESCO report found that out of 72 countries that spend the most on RD 100 million US dollars or more Iceland ranked 9th by proportion of GDP tied with Taiwan Switzerland and Germany and ahead of France the UK and Canada Demographics For statistics on demographics see Demographics of Iceland See also Icelanders The original population of Iceland was of Nordic and Gaelic origin This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses One such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin meaning many settlers of Iceland were indeed Norwegian Viking warriors who brought Gaelic slaves with them Iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the Age of Settlement The biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database that is intended to cover all of Icelands known inhabitants It views the database called Íslendingabók as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases given the relative isolation of Icelands population The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40000 to 60000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid19th century During that time cold winters ash fall from volcanic eruptions and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804 The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50358 After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki volcano during 1783–1784 the population reached a low of about 40000 Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid19th century—from about 60000 in 1850 to 320000 in 2008 Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger With a fertility rate of 21 Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate sufficient for longterm population growth see table on the left In December 2007 33678 people 135 of the total population living in Iceland had been born abroad including children of Icelandic parents living abroad Around 19000 people 6 of the population held foreign citizenship Polish people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce About 8000 Poles now live in Iceland 1500 of them in Fjarðabyggð where they make up 75 of the workforce who are constructing the Fjarðarál aluminium plant The recent increase in immigration has been credited to a labour shortage due to the booming economy at the time as well as to the lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union Largescale construction projects in the east of Iceland see Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary Many Polish immigrants were also considering leaving in 2008 as a result of the Icelandic financial crisis The southwest corner of Iceland is the most densely populated region It is also the location of the capital Reykjavík the northernmost national capital in the world The largest towns outside the Greater Reykjavík area are Akureyri and Reykjanesbær although the latter is relatively close to the capital Some 500 Icelanders under the leadership of Erik the Red colonised Greenland among the existing paleoEskimo inhabitants in the late 10th century The total population reached a high point of perhaps 5000 and developed independent institutions before disappearing by 1500 People from Greenland attempted to set up a colony at Vinland in North America but it was abandoned in the face of hostility from the indigenous residents Emigration to the United States and Canada began in the 1870s As of 2006 Canada had over 88000 people of Icelandic descent while there are more than 40000 Americans of Icelandic descent according to the 2000 US census Urbanisation Icelands 10 most populous urban areas Language Main articles Languages of Iceland and Icelandic language See also Icelandic name Icelands official written and spoken language is Icelandic a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse In grammar and vocabulary it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning in addition to centuries of isolation Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter Þ in Latin script The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is Faroese Icelandic Sign Language was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011 In education its use for Icelands deaf community is regulated by the National Curriculum Guide English and Danish are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum Both languages are widely understood and spoken Other commonly spoken languages are Swedish Norwegian German and French Polish is mostly spoken by the local Polish community the biggest minority of Iceland and Danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to Swedes and Norwegians—it is often referred to as skandinavíska i e Scandinavian in Iceland Rather than using family names as is the usual custom in most western nations Icelanders carry patronymic or matronymic surnames patronyms being far more commonly practiced Patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother These follow the persons given name eg Elísabet Jónsdóttir Elísabet Jóns daughter Jón being the father or Ólafur Katrínarson Ólafur Katríns son Katrín being the mother Consequently Icelanders refer to one another by their given name and the Icelandic telephone directory is listed alphabetically by first name rather than by surname All new names must be decided upon by the Icelandic Naming Committee Health Iceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its Ministry of Welfare Icelandic Velferðarráðuneytið and paid for mostly by taxes 85 and to a lesser extent by service fees 15 Unlike most countries there are no private hospitals and private insurance is practically nonexistent A considerable portion of the government budget is assigned to health care and Iceland ranks 11th in health care expenditures as a percentage of GDP and 14th in spending per capita Over all the countrys health care system is one of the best performing in the world ranked 15th by the World Health Organization According to an OECD report Iceland devotes far more resources to healthcare than most industrialised nations As of 2009 Iceland had 37 doctors per 1000 people compared with an average of 31 in OECD countries and 153 nurses per 1000 people compared with an OECD average of 84 Icelanders are among the worlds healthiest people with 81 reporting they are in good health according to an OECD survey Although it is a growing problem obesity is not as prevalent as in other developed countries Iceland has many campaigns for health and wellbeing Most famously the television show Lazytown starring and created by former gymnastics champion Magnus Scheving Infant mortality is one of the lowest in the world and the proportion of the population that smokes is lower than the OECD average Almost all women choose to terminate pregnancies of children with Down Syndrome in Iceland The average life expectancy is 818 compared to an OECD average of 795 the 4th highest in the world Additionally Iceland has a very low level of pollution thanks to an overwhelming reliance on cleaner geothermal energy a low population density and a high level of environmental consciousness among citizens According to an OECD assessment the amount of toxic material in the atmosphere is far lower than any other industrialised country measured Religion Main article Religion in Iceland Icelanders have freedom of religion guaranteed under the Constitution of Iceland although the Church of Iceland a Lutheran body is the state church The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the State Church in Iceland and as such it shall be supported and protected by the State — Article 62 Section IV of Constitution of Iceland The Registers Iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every Icelandic citizen In 2015 Icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows 716 members of the Church of Iceland 116 members of some other Christian denomination 90 other and not specified 58 unaffiliated 17 members of nonChristian denomination 04 members of the Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association Iceland is a very secular country as with other Nordic nations religious attendance is relatively low The above statistics represent administrative membership of religious organisations which does not necessarily reflect the belief demographics of the population of Iceland According to a study published in 2001 23 of the inhabitants were either atheist or agnostic A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 57 of Icelanders considered themselves religious 31 considered themselves nonreligious while 10 defined themselves as convinced atheists placing Iceland among the ten countries with the highest proportions of atheists in the world Culture Main article Culture of Iceland Icelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions Icelandic literature is popular in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the High and Late Middle Ages Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the countrys Nordic culture from external influence a prominent example is the preservation of the Icelandic language which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Nordic languages In contrast to other Nordic countries Icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and selfsufficiency in a public opinion analysis conducted by the European Commission over 85 of Icelanders believe independence is very important compared to 47 of Norwegians 49 of Danes and an average of 53 for the EU25 Icelanders also have a very strong work ethic working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation According to a poll conducted by the OECD 66 of Icelanders were satisfied with their lives while 70 believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future Similarly 83 of people in Iceland reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones compared to an OECD average of 72 which makes Iceland one of the happiest countries in the OECD A more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives compared to a global average of about 53 Iceland is liberal with regard to LGBT rights issues In 1996 the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create registered partnerships for samesex couples conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage In 2006 parliament voted unanimously to grant samesex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption parenting and assisted insemination treatment On 11 June 2010 the Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise samesex marriage The law took effect on 27 June 2010 The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for samesex couples are now no longer possible and marriage is their only option—identical to the existing situation for oppositesex couples Icelanders are known for their deep sense of community an OECD survey found that 98 believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need higher than in any other industrialised country Similarly only 6 reported rarely or never socializing with others This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation Egalitarianism is highly valued among the people of Iceland with income inequality being among the lowest in the world The constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges titles and ranks Everyone is addressed by their first name As in other Nordic countries equality between the sexes is very high Iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in Literature Main article Icelandic literature Icelands bestknown classical works of literature are the Icelanders sagas prose epics set in Icelands age of settlement The most famous of these include Njáls saga about an epic blood feud and Grænlendinga saga and Eiríks saga describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland modern Newfoundland Egils saga Laxdæla saga Grettis saga Gísla saga and Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu are also notable and popular Icelanders sagas A translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse most famously the Passion Hymns of Hallgrímur Pétursson and rímur rhyming epic poems Originating in the 14th century rímur were popular into the 19th century when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential NationalRomantic writer Jónas Hallgrímsson In recent times Iceland has produced many great writers the bestknown of whom is arguably Halldór Laxness who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955 the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far Steinn Steinarr was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular Icelanders are avid consumers of literature with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world For its size Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines and around 10 of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes Art Main article Icelandic art The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence which was very active in the mid19th century Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of Þórarinn Þorláksson who following formal training in art in the 1890s in Copenhagen returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924 almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at that time including Ásgrímur Jónsson who together with Þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Icelands landscape in a romantic naturalistic style Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þórarinn and Ásgrímur These included Jóhannes Kjarval and Júlíana Sveinsdóttir Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic volcanic rock that dominates the Icelandic environment Einar Hákonarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting In the 1980s many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work In the recent years artistic practice has multiplied and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank has been a significant part of the trend of selforganised spaces exhibitions and projects The Living Art Museum Reykjavík Municipal Art Museum Reykjavík Art Museum and the National Gallery of Iceland are the larger more established institutions

Jochumsson with music by Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson Traditional Icelandic music is strongly religious Hymns both religious and secular are a particularly welldeveloped form of music due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Icelands history Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs which were followed by harmoniums Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur Rímur are epic tales usually a cappella which can be traced back to skaldic poetry using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was Sigurður Breiðfjörð 1798–1846 A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn Icelandic contemporary music consists of a big group of bands ranging from poprock groups such as Bang Gang Quarashi and Amiina to solo ballad singers like Bubbi Morthens Megas and Björgvin Halldórsson Independent music is very strong in Iceland with bands such as múm The Sugarcubes HAM Of Monsters and Men Sigur Rós
