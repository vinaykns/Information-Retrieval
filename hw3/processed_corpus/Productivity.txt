 This article is about the economic and business concept For other uses see Productivity disambiguation Productivity describes various measures of the efficiency of production A productivity measure is expressed as the ratio of output to inputs used in a production process ie output per unit of input Productivity is a crucial factor in production performance of firms and nations Increasing national productivity can raise living standards because more real income improves peoples ability to purchase goods and services enjoy leisure improve housing and education and contribute to social and environmental programs Productivity growth also helps businesses to be more profitable There are many different definitions of productivity and the choice among them depends on the purpose of the productivity measurement andor data availability Partial productivity Main article Partial productivity Productivity measures that use one class of inputs or factors but not multiple factors are called partial productivities In practice measurement in production means measures of partial productivity Interpreted correctly these components are indicative of productivity development and approximate the efficiency with which inputs are used in an economy to produce goods and services However productivity is only measured partially – or approximately In a way the measurements are defective because they do not measure everything but it is possible to interpret correctly the results of partial productivity and to benefit from them in practical situations At the company level typical partial productivity measures are such things as worker hours materials or energy used per unit of production Before widespread use of computer networks partial productivity was tracked in tabular form and with handdrawn graphs Tabulating machines for data processing began being widely used in the 1920s and 1930s and remained in use until mainframe computers became widespread in the late 1960s through the 1970s By the late 1970s inexpensive computers allowed industrial operations to perform process control and track productivity Today data collection is largely computerized and almost any variable can be viewed graphically in real time or retrieved for selected time periods Labor productivity In macroeconomics a common partial productivity measure is labour productivity Labour productivity is a revealing indicator of several economic indicators as it offers a dynamic measure of economic growth competitiveness and living standards within an economy It is the measure of labour productivity and all that this measure takes into account which helps explain the principal economic foundations that are necessary for both economic growth and social development In general labour productivity is equal to the ratio between a measure of output volume gross domestic product or gross value added and a measure of input use the total number of hours worked or total employment The output measure is typically net output more specifically the value added by the process under consideration ie the value of outputs minus the value of intermediate inputs This is done in order to avoid doublecounting when an output of one firm is used as an input by another in the same measurement In macroeconomics the most wellknown and used measure of valueadded is the Gross Domestic Product or GDP It is widely used as a measure of the economic growth of nations and industries GDP is the income available for paying capital costs labor compensation taxes and profitsOECD 200811 Some economists instead use gross value added GVA there is normally a strong correlation between GDP and GVA Freeman 20085 The measure of input use reflects the time effort and skills of the workforce Denominator of the ratio of labour productivity the input measure is the most important factor that influences the measure of labour productivity Labour input is measured either by the total number of hours worked of all persons employed or total employment head count Freeman 20085 There are both advantages and disadvantages associated with the different input measures that are used in the calculation of labour productivity It is generally accepted that the total number of hours worked is the most appropriate measure of labour input because a simple headcount of employed persons can hide changes in average hours worked and has difficulties accounting for variations in work such as a parttime contract leave of absence overtime or shifts in normal hours However the quality of hoursworked estimates is not always clear In particular statistical establishment and household surveys are difficult to use because of their varying quality of hoursworked estimates and their varying degree of international comparability GDP per capita is a rough measure of average living standards or economic wellbeing and is one of the core indicators of economic performance OECD 2008 14 GDP is for this purpose only a very rough measure Maximizing GDP in principle also allows maximizing capital usage For this reason GDP is systematically biased in favour of capital intensive production at the expense of knowledge and labourintensive production The use of capital in the GDPmeasure is considered to be as valuable as the production’s ability to pay taxes profits and labor compensation The bias of the GDP is actually the difference between the GDP and the producer income Saari 20111016 Another labour productivity measure output per worker is often seen as a proper measure of labour productivity as here “Productivity isnt everything but in the long run it is almost everything A countrys ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker“ This measure output per worker is however more problematic than the GDP or even invalid because this measure allows maximizing all supplied inputs ie materials services energy and capital at the expense of producer income Multifactor productivity Main article Total factor productivity When multiple inputs are considered the measure is called Multi Factor Productivity or MFP Multifactor productivity is typically estimated using growth accounting If the inputs specifically are labor and capital and the outputs are value added intermediate outputs the measure is called total factor productivity or TFP TFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour capital and intermediate outputs MFP replaced the term TFP used in the earlier literature and both terms continue in use usually interchangeably Hulten 20097 TFP is often interpreted as a rough average measure of productivity more specifically the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation OECD 200811 The most famous description is that of Solow’s 1957 ”I am using the phrase ’technical change’ as a shorthand expression for any kind of shift in the production function Thus slowdowns speed ups improvements in the education of the labor force and all sorts of things will appear as ’technical change’ ” The original MFP model Solow 1957 involves several assumptions that there is a stable functional relation between inputs and output at the economywide level of aggregation that this function has neoclassical smoothness and curvature properties that inputs are paid the value of their marginal product that the function exhibits constant returns to scale and that technical change has the Hicks’n neutral form Hulten 20095 In practice TFP is a measure of our ignorance as Abramovitz 1956 put it precisely because it is a residual This ignorance covers many components some wanted like the effects of technical and organizational innovation others unwanted measurement error omitted variables aggregation bias model misspecification Hulten 200011 Hence the relationship between TFP and productivity remains unclear Accounting procedure The MFP measure can be compactly introduced with an accounting procedure in the following calculation We can use the fixed price values of the real process in the production model to show the accounting procedure Fixed price values of the real process depict commensurate volumes of the outputs and inputs When we subtract from the output the intermediate inputs we obtain the valueadded Valueadded is used as an output in MFP measure The principle is to compare the growth of the valueadded to the growth of labour and capital input The formula of the MFP growth is as follows Schreyer 20057 change of MFP change of output 1119 minus change of labour input x cost share of labour 1150 x 0475 0546 minus change of capital input x cost share of capital 1030 x 0525 0541 As an accounting result the MFP growth is 1119054605410032 or 32 Total productivity When all outputs and inputs are included in the productivity measure it is called total productivity Total productivity is a measure of total efficiency of a production process and as such is often presented as the objective to be maximized in a production process such as a business Compared to total productivity the MFP model replaces real income with the capital usage by assuming they are equal The reason of this modification is not known nor argued but it weakens the validity of the measure Davis has deliberated the phenomenon of productivity measurement of productivity distribution of productivity gains and how to measure such gains He refers to an article suggesting that the measurement of productivity shall be developed so that it ”will indicate increases or decreases in the productivity of the company and also the distribution of the ’fruits of production’ among all parties at interest” According to Davis the price system is a mechanism through which productivity gains are distributed and besides the business enterprise receiving parties may consist of its customers staff and the suppliers of production inputs Benefits of productivity growth Productivity growth is a crucial source of growth in living standards Productivity growth means more value is added in production and this means more income is available to be distributed At a firm or industry level the benefits of productivity growth can be distributed in a number of different ways to the workforce through better wages and conditions to shareholders and superannuation funds through increased profits and dividend distributions to customers through lower prices to the environment through more stringent environmental protection and to governments through increases in tax payments which can be used to fund social and environmental programs Productivity growth is important to the firm because it means that it can meet its perhaps growing obligations to workers shareholders and governments taxes and regulation and still remain competitive or even improve its competitiveness in the market place Adding more inputs will not increase the income earned per unit of input unless there are increasing returns to scale In fact it is likely to mean lower average wages and lower rates of profit But when there is productivity growth even the existing commitment of resources generates more output and income Income generated per unit of input increases Additional resources are also attracted into production and can be profitably employed Drivers of productivity growth See also Productivity improving technologies In the most immediate sense productivity is determined by the available technology or knowhow for converting resources into outputs and the way in which resources are organized to produce goods and services Historically productivity has improved through evolution as processes with poor productivity performance are abandoned and newer forms are exploited Process improvements may include organizational structures eg core functions and supplier relationships management systems work arrangements manufacturing techniques and changing market structure A famous example is the assembly line and the process of mass production that appeared in the decade following commercial introduction of the automobile Mass production dramatically reduced the labor in producing parts for and assembling the automobile but after its widespread adoption productivity gains in automobile production were much lower A similar pattern was observed with electrification which saw the highest productivity gains in the early decades after introduction Many other industries show similar patterns The pattern was again followed by the computer information and communications industries in the late 1990s when much of the national productivity gains occurred in these industries There is a general understanding of the main determinants or drivers of productivity growth Certain factors are critical for determining productivity growth The Office for National Statistics UK identifies five drivers that interact to underlie longterm productivity performance investment innovation skills enterprise and competition ONS 3 20 Investment is in physical capital — machinery equipment and buildings The more capital workers have at their disposal generally the better they are able to do their jobs producing more and better quality output Innovation is the successful exploitation of new ideas New ideas can take the form of new technologies new products or new corporate structures and ways of working Speeding up the diffusion of innovations can boost productivity Skills are defined as the quantity and quality of labour of different types available in an economy Skills complement physical capital and are needed to take advantage of investment in new technologies and organisational structures Enterprise is defined as the seizing of new business opportunities by both startups and existing firms New enterprises compete with existing firms by new ideas and technologies increasing competition Entrepreneurs are able to combine factors of production and new technologies forcing existing firms to adapt or exit the market Competition improves productivity by creating incentives to innovate and ensures that resources are allocated to the most efficient firms It also forces existing firms to organise work more effectively through imitations of organisational structures and technology Individual and team productivity See also Programming productivity Technology has enabled massive personal productivity gains — computers spreadsheets email and other advances have made it possible for a knowledge worker to seemingly produce more in a day then was previously possible in a year Environmental factors such as sleep and leisure play a significant role in work productivity and received wage Drivers of productivity growth for creative and knowledge workers include improved or intensified exchange with peers or coworkers as more productive peers have a stimulating effect on ones own productivity Productivity is influenced by effective supervision and job satisfaction Having an effective or knowledgeable supervisor for example a supervisor who uses the Management by objectives method has an easier time motivating their employees to produce more in quantity and quality An employee who has an effective supervisor motivating them to be more productive is likely to experience a new level of job satisfaction thereby becoming a driver of productivity itself Workplace bullying results in a loss of productivity as meaured by selfrated job performance Workplace incivility has also been associated with diminished productivity in terms of quality and quantity of work A toxic workplace is a workplace that is marked by significant drama and infighting where personal battles often harm productivity While employees are distracted by this they cannot devote time and attention to the achievement of business goals When toxic employees leave the workplace it can improve the culture overall because the remaining staff become more engaged and productive The presence of a workplace psychopath may have a serious detrimental impact on productivity in an organisation In companies in where the traditional hierarchy has been removed in favor of an egalitarian teambased setup the employees are often happier and individual productivity is improved as they themselves are better placed to increase the efficiency of the workfloor Companies that have these hierarchy removed and have their employees work more in teams are called Liberated companies or Freedom incs See also The Toyota Way Business productivity Productivity is one of the main concerns of business management and engineering Many companies have formal programs for continuously improving productivity such as a production assurance program Whether they have a formal program or not companies are constantly looking for ways to improve quality reduce downtime and inputs of labor materials energy and purchased services Often simple changes to operating methods or processes increase productivity but the biggest gains are normally from adopting new technologies which may require capital expenditures for new equipment computers or software Modern productivity science owes much to formal investigations that are associated with scientific management Although from an individual management perspective employees may be doing their jobs well and with high levels of individual productivity from an organizational perspective their productivity may in fact be zero or effectively negative if they are dedicated to redundant or value destroying activities Productivity paradox Main article Productivity paradox Overall productivity growth was relatively slow from the 1970s through the early 1990s Although several possible causes for the slowdown have been proposed there is no consensus The matter is subject to a continuing debate that has grown beyond questioning whether just computers can significantly increase productivity to whether the potential to increase productivity is becoming exhausted National productivity In order to measure productivity of a nation or an industry it is necessary to operationalize the same concept of productivity as in a production unit or a company yet the object of modelling is substantially wider and the information more aggregate The calculations of productivity of a nation or an industry are based on the time series of the SNA System of National Accounts National accounting is a system based on the recommendations of the UN SNA 93 to measure total production and total income of a nation and how they are used Saari 2006 9 International or national productivity growth stems from a complex interaction of factors Some of the most important immediate factors include technological change organizational change industry restructuring and resource reallocation as well as economies of scale and scope A nations average productivity level can also be affected by the movement of resources from lowproductivity to highproductivity industries and activities Over time other factors such as research and development and innovative effort the development of human capital through education and incentives from stronger competition promote the search for productivity improvements and the ability to achieve them Ultimately many policy institutional and cultural factors determine a nations success in improving productivity At the national level productivity growth raises living standards because more real income improves peoples ability to purchase goods and services whether they are necessities or luxuries enjoy leisure improve housing and education and contribute to social and environmental programs Some have suggested that the UKs productivity puzzle is an urgent issue for policy makers and businesses to address in order to sustain growth Over long periods of time small differences in rates of productivity growth compound like interest in a bank account and can make an enormous difference to a societys prosperity Nothing contributes more to reduction of poverty to increases in leisure and to the countrys ability to finance education public health environment and the arts’ Productivity is considered basic statistical information for many international comparisons and country performance assessments and there is strong interest in comparing them internationally The OECD publishes an annual Compendium of Productivity Indicators that includes both labor and multifactor measures of productivity Several statistical offices publish productivity accounting handbooks and manuals with detailed accounting instructions and definitions For example the following Measuring Productivity – OECD Manual Office for National Statistics UK Productivity handbook Bureau of Labor Statistics Productivity Statistics US Validity Validity is a characteristic of the measure which is used in measuring Validity implies how exact information the used measure can generate from the phenomenon We need to understand the phenomenon the measure and the possible difference between them Often when we aim at simplicity and understandability in measuring we have to lower the requirements for validity For this reason it is important to evaluate the validity of the measurements used case by case Good measuring presupposes that those responsible for measuring are familiar with the validity of the measurements and also keep users informed of the validity In order to evaluate validity of any measure we need to understand the phenomenon the measure and the possible difference between them In the case of productivity we cannot make this evaluation in a traditional way because the phenomenon intended to be measured is somewhat unclear Instead we can identify the differences between models See
