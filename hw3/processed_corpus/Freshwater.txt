 Freshwater redirects here For other uses see Freshwater disambiguation Fresh water is naturally occurring water on Earths surface in ice sheets ice caps glaciers icebergs bogs ponds lakes rivers and streams and underground as groundwater in aquifers and underground streams Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids The term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water although it does include mineralrich waters such as chalybeate springs The term sweet water from Spanish agua dulce has been used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water The term fresh water does not have the same meaning as potable water Much of the surface fresh water and ground water is unsuitable for drinking without some form of purification because of the presence of chemical or biological contaminants Systems Fresh water habitats are divided into lentic systems which are the stillwaters including ponds lakes swamps and mires lotic or runningwater systems and groundwater which flows in rocks and aquifers There is in addition a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems which is the hyporheic zone which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water The majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps Sources The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere in the form of mist rain and snow Fresh water falling as mist rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars factories trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers In coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rainbearing clouds This can give rise to elevated concentrations of sodium chloride magnesium and sulfate as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations In desert areas or areas with impoverished or dusty soils rainbearing winds can pick up sand and dust and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils Significant quantities of iron may be transported in this way including the welldocumented transfer of ironrich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sandstorms in the Sahara in north Africa Water distribution Main article Water distribution on Earth Water is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live Some terrestrial mammals especially desert rodents appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the metabolism of cereal seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree Out of all the water on Earth saline water in oceans seas and saline groundwater make up about 97 of it Only 25–275 is fresh water including 175–2 frozen in glaciers ice and snow 05–075 as fresh groundwater and soil moisture and less than 001 of it as surface water in lakes swamps and rivers Freshwater lakes contain about 87 of this fresh surface water including 29 in the African Great Lakes 20 in Lake Baikal in Russia 21 in the North American Great Lakes and 14 in other lakes Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers most notably the Amazon River The atmosphere contains 004 water In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface fresh water derived from precipitation may because of its lower density overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers Most of the worlds fresh water is frozen in ice sheets Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water such as deserts Numerical definition Fresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 parts per million ppm of dissolved salts Other sources give higher upper salinity limits for fresh water eg 1000 ppm or 3000 ppm Aquatic organisms Fresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities these processes are hormonally controlled The eel Anguilla anguilla uses the hormone prolactin while in salmon Salmo salar the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process Many sea birds have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted Similarly the marine iguanas on the Galápagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion Fresh water as a resource An important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum streamflow especially preserving and restoring instream water allocations Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all ecosystems The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on downstream ecosystems Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage ecosystems Pollution from human activity including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources The largest petroleum spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a Royal Dutch Shell tank ship in Magdalena Argentina on 15 January 1999 polluting the environment drinkable water plants and animals Fresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0003 of total water available globally Agriculture Changing landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water As a result more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture However since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most fresh water this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems In Australia overabstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33 of the land area to be at risk of salination With regards to agriculture the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate Limited resource Fresh water is a renewable and variable but finite natural resource Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle in which water from seas lakes forests land rivers and reservoirs evaporates forms clouds and returns as precipitation Locally however if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments Fresh water withdrawal Fresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose excluding evaporation losses Water drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream Causes of limited fresh water The increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources avialability of clean fresh water The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components water quality water quantity or volume and water timing A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well Water pollution and subsequent eutrophication also reduces the availability of fresh water Fresh water in the future Many areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation to overall health and the production of grain Choices in the use of fresh water With one in eight people in the world not having access to safe water it is important to use this resource in a prudent manner Making the best use of water on a local basis probably provides the best solution Local communities need to plan their use of fresh water and should be made aware of how certain crops and animals use water As a guide the following tables provide some indicators Table 1 Recommended basic water requirements for human needs per person Table 2 Water Requirements of different classes of livestock Table 3 Approximate values of seasonal crop water needs Accessing fresh water Canada Canada has approximately 7 of the world’s renewable fresh water Canadians access their water from ground water lakes and streams it is then cleaned and purified in water treatment plants United States The United States uses much more water per capita than developing countries For example the average American’s daily shower uses more water than a person in a developing country would use for an entire day Las Vegas a city that uses an extreme amount of water to support spectacular lush greenery and golf courses as well as huge fountains and swimming pools gets 90 of its water from Lake Mead which is now at a record alltime low Developing countries In developing countries 780 million people lack access to clean water Half of the population of the developing world suffers from at least one disease caused by insufficient water supply and sanitation See also African Great Lakes Aral Sea Desalination Drinking water Drought Freshwater ecology Great Lakes Lake Baikal Lake Limnology List of countries by freshwater withdrawal List of
