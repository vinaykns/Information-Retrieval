public attention in 1972 with its report The Limits to Growth From 1970 to 1972 at MIT Meadows was director of the Club of Rome Project on Predicament of mankind at MIT which constructed the world model underlying that publication The Limits to Growth The Limits to Growth is a 1972 book modeling the consequences of a rapidly growing world population and finite resource supplies commissioned by the Club of Rome Meadows coauthored the book with Donella H Meadows Jørgen Randers and William W Behrens III The book used the World3 model to simulate the consequence of interactions between the Earths and human systems The book echoes some of the concerns and predictions of the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus in An Essay on the Principle of Population 1798 The eventual purpose of The Limits to Growth was not to make specific predictions but to explore how exponential growth interacts with finite resources Because the size of resources is not known only the general behavior can be explored The 30year update There has been a major cultural shift in the thinking about global processes in the last three decades of the 20th century In an 2004 interview Meadows explained In their 1972 publication Limits to Growth their recommendations were focused on how to slow growth In the 2004 Limits to growth  the 30year update the message has changed Meadows explained Now we must tell people how to manage an orderly reduction of their activities back down below the limits of the earths resources In 2014 research at the University of Melbourne confirmed that the predictions from the book Limits to Growth were largely correct Presently we are very close to tracking “businessasusual” scenario from the book See also Degrowth System Dynamics Publications He has written or coauthored
