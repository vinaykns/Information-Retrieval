listen officially the Kingdom of Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries it is southwest of Sweden and south of Norway and bordered to the south by Germany The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean the Faroe Islands and Greenland Denmark has a total area of 42924 square kilometres 16573 sq mi and a population of 575 million The country consists of a peninsula Jutland and an archipelago of 443 named islands with the largest being Zealand and Funen The islands are characterised by flat arable land and sandy coasts low elevation and a temperate climate The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea Denmark Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523 Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814 The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands Iceland and Greenland Beginning in the 17th century there were several cessions of territory to Sweden In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War Denmark remained neutral during World War I In April 1940 a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945 An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century Denmark introduced social and labourmarket reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849 ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660 It establishes a constitutional monarchy organised as a parliamentary democracy The government and national parliament are seated in Copenhagen the nations capital largest city and main commercial centre Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm devolving powers to handle internal affairs Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 in Greenland home rule was established in 1979 and further autonomy in 2009 Denmark became a member of the European Economic Community now the EU in 1973 maintaining certain optouts it retains its own currency the krone It is among the founding members of NATO the Nordic Council the OECD OSCE and the United Nations it is also part of the Schengen Area Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the country ranks highly in some metrics of national performance including education health care protection of civil liberties democratic governance prosperity and human development The country ranks as having the worlds highest social mobility a high level of income equality is the country with the lowest perceived level of corruption in the world has one of the worlds highest per capita incomes and one of the worlds highest personal income tax rates Etymology Main article Etymology of Denmark The etymology of the word Denmark and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom is a subject which attracts debate This is centred primarily on the prefix Dan and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the mark ending Most handbooks derive the first part of the word and the name of the people from a word meaning flat land related to German Tenne threshing floor English den cave The mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland see marches with probable references to the border forests in south Schleswig The first recorded use of the word Danmark within Denmark itself is found on the two Jelling stones which are runestones believed to have been erected by Gorm the Old c 955 and Harald Bluetooth c 965 The larger stone of the two is popularly cited as Denmarks baptismal certificate dåbsattest though both use the word Denmark in the form of accusative ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ tanmaurk danmɒrk on the large stone and genitive ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ tanmarkar pronounced danmarkaɽ on the small stone The inhabitants of Denmark are there called tani danɪ or Danes in the accusative History Main article History of Denmark See also History of Greenland and History of the Faroe Islands Prehistory The earliest archaeological findings in Denmark date back to the Eem interglacial period from 130000–110000 BC Denmark has been inhabited since around 12500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC The Nordic Bronze Age 1800–600 BC in Denmark was marked by burial mounds which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the Sun Chariot During the PreRoman Iron Age 500 BC – AD 1 native groups began migrating south and the first tribal Danes came to the country between the PreRoman and the Germanic Iron Age in the Roman Iron Age AD 1–400 The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark and Roman coins have been found in Denmark Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of NorthWest Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron The tribal Danes came from the east Danish islands Zealand and Scania and spoke an early form of North Germanic Historians believe that before their arrival most of Jutland and the nearest islands were settled by tribal Jutes The Jutes migrated to Great Britain eventually some as mercenaries by Brythonic King Vortigern and were granted the southeastern territories of Kent the Isle of Wight and other areas where they settled They were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading Angles and Saxons who formed the AngloSaxons The remaining Jutish population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling Danes A short note about the Dani in Getica by the historian Jordanes is believed to be an early mention of the Danes one of the ethnic groups from whom modern Danes are descended The Danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe the oldest town of Denmark was founded about AD 700 Viking and Middle Ages Main articles Viking Age and Kalmar Union From the 8th to the 10th century the wider Scandinavian region was the source of Vikings They colonised raided and traded in all parts of Europe The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern British Isles and Western Europe They conquered and settled parts of England known as the Danelaw under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and France where Danes and Norwegians founded Normandy with Rollo as head of state More AngloSaxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources as kings reges Under the reign of Gudfred in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the lands of Jutland Scania and the Danish islands excluding Bornholm The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to Gorm the Old who established his reign in the early 10th century As attested by the Jelling stones the Danes were Christianised around 965 by Harald Bluetooth the son of Gorm It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe the Holy Roman Empire which was an important trading area for the Danes In that case Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke In the early 11th century Canute the Great won and united Denmark England and Norway for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages Denmark also included Skåneland the areas of Scania Halland and Blekinge in presentday south Sweden and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein Most of the latter two now form the state of SchleswigHolstein in northern Germany In 1397 Denmark entered into a personal union with Norway and Sweden united under Queen Margaret I The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union However even from the start Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear senior partner of the union Thus much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union with Sweden breaking off and being reconquered repeatedly The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523 as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm The Protestant Reformation spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s and following the Counts Feud civil war Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536 Later that year Denmark entered into a union with Norway Early modern history 1536–1849 Main articles Denmark–Norway and Danish colonial empire After Sweden permanently broke away from the personal union Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour King Christian IV attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 Kalmar War but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union The war led to no territorial changes but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark an amount known as the Älvsborg ransom King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses most notably Glückstadt founded as a rival to Hamburg and Christiania Inspired by the Dutch East India Company he founded a similar Danish company and planned to claim Ceylon as a colony but the company only managed to acquire Tranquebar on Indias Coromandel Coast Denmarks large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in Africa and India The empire was sustained by trade with other major powers and plantations – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation In the Thirty Years War Christian tried to become the leader of the Lutheran states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Lutter The result was that the Catholic army under Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to invade occupy and pillage Jutland forcing Denmark to withdraw from the war Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions but King Gustavus Adolphus intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmarks influence in the region was declining In 1643 Swedish armies invaded Jutland and claimed Scania in 1644 In the 1645 Treaty of Brømsebro Denmark surrendered Halland Gotland the last parts of Danish Estonia and several provinces in Norway In 1657 King Frederick III declared war on Sweden and marched on BremenVerden This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden conquered both Jutland Funen and much of Zealand before signing the Peace of Roskilde in February 1658 which gave Sweden control of Scania Blekinge Trøndelag and the island of Bornholm Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked Denmark and in August 1658 he began a twoyearlong siege of Copenhagen but failed to take the capital In the following peace settlement Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm Denmark tried to regain control of Scania in the Scanian War 1675–1679 but it ended in failure Following the Great Northern War 1700–21 Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of HolsteinGottorp in the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg and the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo respectively Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its neutral status allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars In the Napoleonic Wars Denmark traded with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia Sweden and Prussia The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807 in one case carrying off the Danish fleet in the other burning large parts of the Danish capital This led to the socalled DanishBritish Gunboat War British control over the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the unions economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went bankrupt The DanishNorwegian union was dissolved by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 the Danish monarchy irrevocably and forever renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king After the dissolution of the union with Norway Denmark kept the possessions of Iceland which retained the Danish monarchy until 1944 the Faroe Islands and Greenland all of which had been governed by Norway for centuries Apart from the Nordic colonies Denmark continued to rule over Danish India from 1620 to 1869 the Danish Gold Coast Ghana from 1658 to 1850 and the Danish West Indies from 1671 to 1917 Constitutional monarchy 1849–present A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s after the European Revolutions of 1848 Denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 June 1849 A new constitution established a twochamber parliament Denmark faced war against both Prussia and Habsburg Austria in what became known as the Second Schleswig War lasting from February to October 1864 Denmark was defeated and obliged to cede Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century After these events Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe Industrialisation came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century The nations first railroads were constructed in the 1850s and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmarks lack of natural resources Trade unions developed starting in the 1870s There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products Denmark maintained its neutral stance during World War I After the defeat of Germany the Versailles powers offered to return the region of SchleswigHolstein to Denmark Fearing German irredentism Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a plebiscite the two Schleswig Plebiscites took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920 respectively On 10 July 1920 Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark thereby adding some 163600 inhabitants and 3984 square kilometres 1538 sq mi In 1939 Denmark signed a 10year nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany but Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940 and the Danish government quickly surrendered World War II in Denmark was characterised by economic cooperation with Germany until 1943 when the Danish government refused further cooperation and its navy scuttled most of its ships and sent many of its officers to Sweden which was neutral The Danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to evacuate several thousand Jews and their families to safety in Sweden before the Germans could send them to death camps Some Danes supported Nazism by joining the Danish Nazi Party or volunteering to fight with Germany as part of the Frikorps Danmark Iceland severed ties to Denmark and became an independent republic in 1944 Germany surrendered in May 1945 in 1948 the Faroe Islands gained home rule in 1949 Denmark became a founding member of NATO Denmark was a founding member of European Free Trade Association EFTA During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven as opposed to the Inner Six of what was then the European Economic Community EEC In 1973 along with Britain and Ireland Denmark joined the European Economic Community now the European Union after a public referendum The Maastricht Treaty which involved further European integration was rejected by the Danish people in 1992 it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993 which provided for four optouts from policies The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000 Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded selfdetermination in 2009 Neither the Faroe Islands nor Greenland are members of the European Union the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986 in both cases because of fisheries policies Constitutional change in 1953 led to a singlechamber parliament elected by proportional representation female accession to the Danish throne and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark The centreleft Social Democrats led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century introducing the Nordic welfare model The Liberal Party and the Conservative Peoples Party have also led centreright governments In recent years the rightwing populist Danish Peoples Party has emerged as a major party—becoming the secondlargest following the 2015 general election—during which time immigration and integration have become major issues of public debate Geography Main article Geography of Denmark Also related Geography of the Faroe Islands and Geography of Greenland Located in Northern Europe Denmark consists of the peninsula of Jutland and 443 named islands 1419 islands above 100 square metres 1100 sq ft in total Of these 74 are inhabited January 2015 with the largest being Zealand the North Jutlandic Island and Funen The island of Bornholm is located east of the rest of the country in the Baltic Sea Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges the Øresund Bridge connects Zealand with Sweden the Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands The largest cities with populations over 100000 are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand Aarhus and Aalborg in Jutland and Odense on Funen The country occupies a total area of 42924 square kilometres 16573 sq mi The area of inland water is 700 km 270 sq mi variously stated as from 500 – 700 km 193–270 sq m Lake Arresø northwest of Copenhagen is the largest lake The size of the land area cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline and because of human land reclamation projects to counter erosion Postglacial rebound raises the land by a bit less than 1 cm 04 in per year in the north and east extending the coast A circle enclosing the same area as Denmark would be 234 kilometres 145 miles in diameter with a circumference of 742 km 461 mi It shares a border of 68 kilometres 42 mi with Germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by 8750 km 5437 mi of tidal shoreline including small bays and inlets No location in Denmark is further from the coast than 52 km 32 mi On the southwest coast of Jutland the tide is between 1 and 2 m 328 and 656 ft and the tideline moves outward and inward on a 10 km 62 mi stretch Denmarks territorial waters total 105000 square kilometres 40541 square miles Denmarks northernmost point is Skagens point the north beach of the Skaw at 57° 45 7 northern latitude the southernmost is Gedser point the southern tip of Falster at 54° 33 35 northern latitude the westernmost point is Blåvandshuk at 8° 4 22 eastern longitude and the easternmost point is Østerskær at 15° 11 55 eastern longitude This is in the archipelago Ertholmene 18 kilometres 11 mi northeast of Bornholm The distance from east to west is 452 kilometres 281 mi from north to south 368 kilometres 229 mi The country is flat with little elevation having an average height above sea level of 31 metres 102 ft The highest natural point is Møllehøj at 17086 metres 56056 ft A sizeable portion of Denmarks terrain consists of rolling plains whilst the coastline is sandy with large dunes in northern Jutland Although once extensively forested today Denmark largely consists of arable land It is drained by a dozen or so rivers and the most significant include the Gudenå Odense Skjern Suså and Vidå—a river that flows along its southern border with Germany The Kingdom of Denmark includes two overseas territories both well to the west of Denmark Greenland the worlds largest island and the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean These territories are selfgoverning and form part of the Danish Realm Climate Denmark has a temperate climate characterised by mild winters with mean temperatures in January of 15 °C 347 °F and cool summers with a mean temperature in August of 172 °C 630 °F The most extreme temperatures recorded in Denmark since 1874 when recordings began was 364 °C 975 °F in 1975 and −3102 °C −2384 °F in 1982 Denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation on average receiving a total of 765 millimetres 30 in per year autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest The position between a continent and an ocean means that weather often changes Because of Denmarks northern location there are large seasonal variations in daylight There are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 845 am and sunset 345 pm standard time as well as long summer days with sunrise at 430 am and sunset at 10 pm daylight saving time Ecology Further information List of forests in Denmark List of mammals of Denmark and List of birds of Denmark Denmark belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and can be subdivided into two ecoregions the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests Almost all of Denmarks primeval temperate forests have been destroyed or fragmented chiefly for agricultural purposes during the last millennia The deforestation has created large swaths of heathland and devastating sand drifts In spite of this there are several larger second growth woodlands in the country and in total 129 of the land is now forested Norway spruce is the most widespread tree 2017 being important in the production of Christmas trees Roe deer occupy the countryside in growing numbers and largeantlered red deer can be found in the sparse woodlands of Jutland Denmark is also home to smaller mammals such as polecats hares and hedgehogs Approximately 400 bird species inhabit Denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country Large marine mammals include healthy populations of Harbour porpoise growing numbers of pinnipeds and occasional visits of large whales including blue whales and orcas Cod herring and plaice are abundant fish in Danish waters and form the basis for a large fishing industry Environment Land and water pollution are two of Denmarks most significant environmental issues although much of the countrys household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled The country has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973 To mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the Danish Government has signed the Climate ChangeKyoto Protocol However the national ecological footprint is 826 global hectares per person which is very high compared to a world average of 17 in 2010 Contributing factors to this value are an exceptional high value for cropland but also a relatively high value for grazing land which may be explained by the substantially high meat production in Denmark 1158 kilograms 255 lb meat annually per capita and the large economic role of the meat and dairy industries In December 2014 the Climate Change Performance Index for 2015 placed Denmark at the top of the table explaining that although emissions are still quite high the country was able to implement effective climate protection policies Denmark has an outstanding performance in the global Environmental Performance Index EPI with an overall ranking of 4 out of 180 countries in 2016 This recent and significant increase in ranking and performance is mostly due to remarkable achievements in energy efficiency and reductions in CO2 emission levels A future implementation of air quality improvements are expected The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals The environmental areas where Denmark performs best ie lowest ranking are sanitation 12 water resource management 13 and health impacts of environmental issues 14 followed closely by the area of biodiversity and habitat The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality one of many weaknesses in the EPI Denmark performs worst ie highest ranking in the areas of environmental effects of fisheries 128 and forest management 96 The very poor ranking in the fisheries area are due to alarmingly low and continually rapidly declining fish stocks placing Denmark among the worst performing countries of the world Administrative divisions Main articles Regions of Denmark and Municipalities of Denmark Midtjylland Nordjylland Syddanmark Hovedstaden Sjælland Denmark with a total area of 43094 square kilometres 16639 sq mi is divided into five administrative regions Danish regioner The regions are further subdivided into 98 municipalities kommuner The easternmost land in Denmark the Ertholmene archipelago with an area of 39 hectares 016 sq m is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the Ministry of Defence The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the sixteen former counties At the same time smaller municipalities were merged into larger units reducing the number from 270 Most municipalities have a population of at least 20000 to give them financial and professional sustainability although a few exceptions were made to this rule The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils elected proportionally every four years the most recent Danish local elections were held on 19 November 2013 Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout including the police districts the court districts and the electoral wards Regions The governing bodies of the regions are the regional councils with fortyone members elected for fouryear terms The head of the council is the regional council chairman regionsrådsformand who is elected by the council The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the national health service social services and regional development Unlike the counties they replaced the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is partly financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 sundhedsbidrag partly by funds from both government and municipalities From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished The area and populations of the regions vary widely for example the Capital Region which encompasses the Copenhagen metropolitan area with the exception of the subtracted province East Zeeland but includes the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm has a population three times larger than that of North Denmark Region which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern Jutland Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities such as Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg had been given a status equivalent to that of counties making them firstlevel administrative divisions These sui generis municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms Greenland and the Faroe Islands The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary state that comprises in addition to Denmark proper two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean Greenland and the Faroe Islands They have been integrated parts of the Danish Realm since the 18th century however due to their separate historical and cultural identities these parts of the Realm have extensive political powers and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields The Faroe Islands gained home rule in 1948 and Greenland in 1979 having previously had the status of counties The two territories have their own home governments and parliaments and are effectively selfgoverning in regards to domestic affairs High Commissioners Rigsombudsmand act as representatives of the Danish government in the Faroese Løgting and in the Greenlandic Parliament but they cannot vote The Faroese home government is defined to be an equal partner with the Danish national government while the Greenlandic people are defined as a separate people with the right to selfdetermination Politics Main article Politics of Denmark See also Politics of the Faroe Islands and Politics of Greenland Politics in Denmark operates under a framework laid out in the Constitution of Denmark First written in 1849 it establishes a sovereign state in the form of a constitutional monarchy with a representative parliamentary system The Monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State privy council In practice the duties of the Monarch are strictly representative and ceremonial such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other Government ministers The Monarch is not answerable for his or her actions and their person is sacrosanct Hereditary monarch Queen Margrethe II has been head of state since 14 January 1972 Government Main articles Folketing and Cabinet of Denmark The Danish Parliament is called the Folketing Danish Folketinget It is the legislature of the Kingdom of Denmark passing Acts that apply in Denmark and in limited cases Greenland and the Faroe Islands The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the states budgets approving the states accounts appointing and exercising control of the Government and taking part in international cooperation Bills may be initiated by the Government or by members of parliament All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive Royal Assent within thirty days in order to become law Denmark is a representative democracy with universal suffrage Membership of the Folketing is based on proportional representation of political parties with a 2 electoral threshold Danes elect 175 members to the Folketing with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years but it is within the powers of the Prime Minister to ask the Monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed On a vote of no confidence the Folketing may force a single minister or the entire government to resign The Government of Denmark operates as a cabinet government where executive authority is exercised—formally on behalf of the Monarch—by Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers who head ministries As the executive branch the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget executing the laws and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the Folketing this is usually the current leader of the largest political party or more effectively through a coalition of parties A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own Denmark has often been ruled by coalition governments themselves sometimes minority governments dependent on nongovernment parties Following a general election defeat in June 2015 Helle ThorningSchmidt leader of the Social Democrats Socialdemokraterne resigned as Prime Minister She was succeeded by Lars Løkke Rasmussen the leader of the Liberal Party Venstre Rasmussen became the leader of a cabinet which unusually consisted entirely of ministers from his own party In the next cabinet created November 2016 there are several political parties represented Law and judicial system Main articles Law of Denmark and Courts of Denmark See also Crime in Denmark Denmark has a civil law system with some references to Germanic law Denmark resembles Norway and Sweden in never having developed a caselaw like that of England and the United States nor comprehensive codes like those of France and Germany Much of its law is customary The judicial system of Denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration Articles sixtytwo and sixtyfour of the Constitution ensure judicial independence from government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law including acts statutes and practice The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark has one system Greenland another and the Faroe Islands a third However decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts The Danish Supreme Court is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the Kingdom Foreign relations Main article Foreign relations of Denmark Denmark wields considerable influence in Northern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs In recent years Greenland and the Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing whaling and geopolitical concerns The foreign policy of Denmark is substantially influenced by its membership of the European Union EU Denmark joined the European Economic Community EEC the EUs predecessor in 1973 Denmark held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on seven occasions most recently from January to June 2012 Following World War II Denmark ended its twohundredyearlong policy of neutrality It has been a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO since 1949 and membership remains highly popular As a member of Development Assistance Committee DAC Denmark has for a long time been among the countries of the world contributing the largest percentage of gross national income to development aid In 2015 Denmark contributed 085 of its gross national income GNI to foreign aid and was one of only six countries meeting the longstanding UN target of 07 of GNI The country participates in both bilateral and multilateral aid with the aid usually administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs The organisational name of Danish International Development Agency DANIDA is often used in particular when operating bilateral aid Military See also Danish Defence and Military history of Denmark Denmarks armed forces are known as the Danish Defence Danish Forsvaret The Minister of Defence is commanderinchief of the Danish Defence and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad During peacetime the Ministry of Defence employs around 33000 in total The main military branches employ almost 27000 15460 in the Royal Danish Army 5300 in the Royal Danish Navy and 6050 in the Royal Danish Air Force all including conscripts The Danish Emergency Management Agency employs 2000 including conscripts and about 4000 are in nonbranchspecific services like the Danish Defence Command and the Danish Defence Intelligence Service Furthermore around 55000 serve as volunteers in the Danish Home Guard Denmark is a longtime supporter of international peacekeeping but since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the War in Afghanistan in 2001 Denmark has also found a new role as a warring nation participating actively in several wars and invasions This relatively new situation has stirred some internal critique but the Danish population has generally been very supportive in particular of the War in Afghanistan The Danish Defence has around 1400 staff in international missions not including standing contributions to NATO SNMCMG1 Danish forces were heavily engaged in the former Yugoslavia in the UN Protection Force UNPROFOR with IFOR and now SFOR Between 2003 and 2007 there were approximately 450 Danish soldiers in Iraq Denmark also strongly supported American operations in Afghanistan and has contributed both monetarily and materially to the ISAF These initiatives are often described by the authorities as part of a new active foreign policy of Denmark Economy Further information Economy of Denmark and List of companies of Denmark Denmark has a developed mixed economy that is classed as a highincome economy by the World Bank It ranks 18th in the world in terms of GDP PPP per capita and 6th in nominal GDP per capita Denmarks economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World It is the 13th most competitive economy in the world and 8th in Europe according to the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015 Denmark has the fourth highest ratio of tertiary degree holders in the world The country ranks highest in the world for workers rights GDP per hour worked was the 13th highest in 2009 The country has a market income inequality close to the OECD average but after public cash transfers the income inequality is very low According to the International Monetary Fund Denmark has the worlds highest minimum wage As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions For example as the result of a collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the employers group Horesta workers at McDonalds and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US20 an hour which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States and have access to five weeks paid vacation parental leave and a pension plan Union density

approximately 39 of GNP foreign debt or more than DKK 300 billion A liberalisation of import tariffs in 1797 marked the end of mercantilism and further liberalisation in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century established the Danish liberal tradition in international trade that was only to be broken by the 1930s Even when other countries such as Germany and France raised protection for their agricultural sector because of increased American competition resulting in much lower agricultural prices after 1870 Denmark retained its free trade policies as the country profited from the cheap imports of cereals used as feedstuffs for their cattle and pigs and could increase their exports of butter and meat of which the prices were more stable Today Denmark is part of the European Unions internal market which represents more than 508 million consumers Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union EU members and by EU legislation Support for free trade is high among the Danish public in a 2007 poll 76 responded that globalisation is a good thing 70 of trade flows are inside the European Union As of 2014 Denmarks largest export partners are Germany Sweden the United Kingdom and Norway Denmarks currency the krone DKK is pegged at approximately 746 kroner per euro through the ERM Although a September 2000 referendum rejected adopting the euro the country follows the policies set forth in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and meets the economic convergence criteria needed to adopt the euro The majority of the political parties in the Folketing support adopting the euro but as yet a new referendum has not been held despite plans scepticism of the EU among Danish voters has historically been strong

is characterised by extensive government welfare provisions Like other Nordic countries Denmark has adopted the Nordic Model which combines free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and strong worker protection As a result of its acclaimed flexicurity model Denmark has the most free labour market in Europe according to the World Bank Employers can hire and fire whenever they want flexibility and between jobs unemployment compensation is very high security Establishing a business can be done in a matter of hours and at very low costs No restrictions apply regarding overtime work which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year Denmark has a competitive corporate tax rate of 245 and a special timelimited tax regime for expatriates The Danish taxation system is broad based with a 25 valueadded tax in addition to excise taxes income taxes and other fees The overall level of taxation sum of all taxes as a percentage of GDP is estimated to be 46 in 2011 As of 2014 6 of the population was reported to live below the poverty line when adjusted for taxes and transfers Denmark has the 2nd lowest relative poverty rate in the OECD below the 113 OECD average The share of the population reporting that they feel that they cannot afford to buy sufficient food in Denmark is less than half of the OECD average With an employment rate of 728 Denmark ranks 7th highest among the OECD countries and above the OECD average of 662 The number of unemployed people is forecast to be 65000 in 2015 The number of people in the working age group less disability pensioners etc will grow by 10000 to 2860000 and jobs by 70000 to 2790000 parttime jobs are included Because of the present high demand and short supply of skilled labour for instance for factory and service jobs including hospital nurses and physicians the annual average working hours have risen especially compared with the recession 1987–1993 Increasingly service workers of all kinds are in demand ie in the postal services and as bus drivers and academics The level of unemployment benefits is dependent on former employment the maximum benefit is at 90 of the wage and at times also on membership of an unemployment fund which is almost always—but need not be—administered by a trade union and the previous payment of contributions However the largest share of the financing is still carried by the central government and is financed by general taxation and only to a minor degree from earmarked contributions There is no taxation however on proceeds gained from selling ones home

oil and natural gas in the North Sea and ranks as number 32 in the world among net exporters of crude oil and was producing 259980 barrels of crude oil a day in 2009 Denmark is a longtime leader in wind power In 2015 wind turbines provided 421 of the total electricity power consumption in May 2011 Denmark derived 31 of its gross domestic product from renewable clean energy technology and energy efficiency or around €65 billion 94 billion Denmark is connected by electric transmission lines to other European countries On 6 September 2012 Denmark launched the biggest wind turbine in the world and will add four more over the next four yearsDenmarks electricity sector has integrated energy sources such as wind power into the national grid Denmark now aims to focus on intelligent battery systems V2G and plugin vehicles in the transport sector The country is a member nation of the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA Transport Main article Transport in Denmark Significant investment has been made in building road and rail links between regions in Denmark most notably the Great Belt Fixed Link which connects Zealand and Funen It is now possible to drive from Frederikshavn in northern Jutland to Copenhagen on eastern Zealand without leaving the motorway The main railway operator is DSB for passenger services and DB Schenker Rail for freight trains The railway tracks are maintained by Banedanmark The North Sea and the Baltic Sea are intertwined by various international ferry links Construction of the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link connecting Denmark and Germany with a second link will start in 2015 Copenhagen has a rapid transit system the Copenhagen Metro and an extensive electrified suburban railway network the Strain In the four largest cities –

Scandinavias busiest passenger airport handling over 25 million passengers in 2014 Other notable airports are Billund Airport Aalborg Airport and Aarhus Airport Cycling in Denmark is a common form of transport particularly for the young and for city dwellers With a network of bicycle routes extending more than 12000 km and an estimated 7000 km of segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes Denmark has a solid bicycle infrastructure Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport Because of the high registration tax 150 VAT 25 and one of the worlds highest income tax rates new cars are very expensive The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership In 2007 an attempt was made by the government to favour environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles However this has had little effect and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes As of 2011 the average car age is 92 years Demographics Main article Demographics of Denmark The population of Denmark as defined by Statistics Denmark was estimated in January 2017 to be 5748769 The median age is 414 years with 097 males per female The total fertility rate is 173 children born per woman despite the low birth rate the population is still growing at an average annual rate of 022 Notably very few Down Syndrome children are born in Denmark with 98 of DS pregnancies aborted in 2014 The World Happiness Report frequently ranks Denmarks population as the happiest in the world This has been attributed to the countrys highly regarded education and health care systems and its low level of income inequality Denmark is an historically homogeneous nation However as with its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark has recently transformed from a nation of net emigration up until World War II to a nation of net immigration Today immigration to Denmark consists particularly of asylum seekers and persons who arrive as family dependants In addition Denmark annually receives a number of citizens from Western countries notably Nordic countries the EU and North America who seek residency to work or study for a definite period of time Recently substantial numbers of workers—several tens of thousands—from the new EU accession countries especially Poland and the Baltic nations have arrived to perform menial labour in construction agriculture consumer industries and cleaning Overall the net migration rate in 2015 was 22 migrants1000 population comparable to the United Kingdom and well below other North European countries except the Baltic states There are no official statistics on ethnic groups but according to 2016 figures from Statistics Denmark approximately 877 of the population was of Danish descent defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship The remaining 123 were of a foreign

Empire prior to the Treaty of Versailles Danish and Faroese belong to the North Germanic Nordic branch of the IndoEuropean languages along with Icelandic Norwegian and Swedish The languages are so closely related that it is possible for Danish Norwegian and Swedish speakers to understand each other with relatively little effort Danish is more distantly related to German which is a West Germanic language Greenlandic or Kalaallisut belongs to the Eskimo–Aleut languages it is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut and entirely unrelated to Danish A large majority 86 of Danes speak English as a second language generally with a high level of proficiency German is the secondmost spoken foreign language with 47 reporting a conversational level of proficiency Denmark had 25900 native speakers of German in 2007 mostly in the South Jutland area Religion Main article Religion in Denmark Christianity is the dominant religion in Denmark that has a state religion that

Lutheran in tradition This is down 09 compared to the year earlier and 15 down compared to two years earlier Despite the high membership figures only 3 of the population regularly attend Sunday services and only 19 of Danes consider religion to be an important part of their life The Constitution states that a member of the Royal Family must be a member of the Church of Denmark though the rest of the population is free to adhere to other faiths In 1682 the state granted limited recognition to three religious groups dissenting from the Established Church Roman Catholicism the Reformed Church and Judaism although conversion to these groups from the Church of Denmark remained illegal initially Until the 1970s the state formally recognised religious societies by royal decree Today religious groups do not need official government recognition they can be granted the right to perform weddings and other ceremonies without this recognition Denmarks Muslims make up approximately 37 of the population and form the countrys second largest religious community and largest minority religion The Danish Foreign Ministry estimates that other religious groups comprise less than 1 of the population individually and approximately 2 when taken all together According to a 2010 Eurobarometer Poll 28 of Danish citizens polled responded that they believe there is a God 47 responded that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 24 responded that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit God or life force Another poll carried out in 2009 found that 25 of Danes believe Jesus is the son of God and 18 believe he is the saviour of the world Education Main article Education in Denmark All educational programmes in Denmark are regulated by the Ministry of Education and administered by local municipalities Folkeskole covers the entire period of compulsory education encompassing primary and lower secondary education Most children attend folkeskole for 10 years from the ages of 6 to 16 There are no final examinations but pupils can choose to go to a test when finishing ninth grade 14–15 years old The test is obligatory if further education is to be attended Pupils can alternatively attend an independent school friskole or a private school privatskole such as Christian schools or Waldorf schools Following graduation from compulsory education there are several continuing educational opportunities the Gymnasium STX attaches importance in teaching a mix of humanities and science Higher Technical Examination Programme HTX focuses on scientific subjects and the Higher Commercial Examination Programme emphasises on subjects in economics Higher Preparatory Examination HF is similar to Gymnasium STX but is one year shorter For specific professions there is vocational education training young people for work in specific trades by a combination of teaching and apprenticeship The government records upper secondary school completion rates of 95 and tertiary enrolment and completion rates of 60 All university and college tertiary education in Denmark is free of charges there are no tuition fees to enrol in courses

international students a range of opportunities for obtaining an internationally recognised qualification in Denmark Many programmes may be taught in the English language the academic lingua franca in bachelors degrees masters degrees doctorates and student exchange programmes Health See also Health care in Denmark As of 2012 Denmark has a life expectancy of 795 years at birth 77 for men 82 for women up from 75 years in 1990 This ranks it 37th among 193 nations behind the other Nordic countries The National Institute of Public Health of the University of Southern Denmark has calculated 19 major risk factors among Danes that contribute to a lowering of the life expectancy this includes smoking alcohol drug abuse and physical inactivity The large number of Danes becoming overweight is an increasing problem and results in an annual additional consumption in the health care system of DKK 1625 million In a 2012 study Denmark had the highest cancer rate of all countries listed by the World Cancer Research Fund International researchers suggest the reasons are better reporting but also lifestyle factors like heavy alcohol consumption smoking and physical inactivity Denmark has a universal health care system characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and for most of the services run directly by the regional authorities One of the sources of income is a national health care contribution sundhedsbidrag 2007–118 127 136 145 154 163 172 181 190 but it is being phased out and will be gone from January 2019 with the income taxes in the lower brackets being raised gradually each year instead Another source comes from the municipalities which had their income taxes raised by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007 a contribution confiscated from the former county tax to be used from 1 January 2007 for health purposes by the municipalities instead This means that most health care provision is free at the point of delivery for all residents Additionally roughly two in five have complementary private insurance to cover services not fully covered by the state such as physiotherapy As of 2012 Denmark spends 112 of its GDP on health care this is up from 98 in 2007 US3512 per capita This places Denmark above the OECD average and above the other Nordic countries Culture Main article Culture of Denmark See also LGBT rights in Denmark Denmark shares strong cultural and historic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours Sweden and Norway It has historically been one of the most socially progressive cultures in the world In 1969 Denmark was the first country to legalise pornography and in 2012 Denmark replaced its registered partnership laws which it had been the first country to introduce in 1989 with genderneutral marriage Modesty and social equality are important parts of Danish culture so much so that success or what may be seen as a deliberate attempt to distinguish oneself from others may be viewed with hostility This characteristic is called Janteloven or Law of Jante by Danes The astronomical discoveries of Tycho Brahe 1546–1601 Ludwig A Coldings 1815–88 neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy and the contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr 1885–1962 indicate the range of Danish scientific achievement The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen 1805–1875 the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard 1813–55 the short stories of Karen Blixen penname Isak Dinesen 1885–1962 the plays of Ludvig Holberg 1684–1754 and the dense aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein 1905–96 have earned

German occupation during World War II brought informal censorship some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis During the war the underground produced 550 newspapers—small surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of product due largely to funding by the statesupported Danish Film Institute There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema erotic melodrama of the silent era the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s and lastly the Dogme 95 movement of the late 1990s where directors often used handheld cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against bigbudget studios Danish films have been noted for their realism religious and moral themes sexual frankness and technical innovation The Danish filmmaker Carl Th Dreyer 1889–1968 is considered one of the greatest directors of early cinema Other Danish filmmakers of note include Erik Balling the creator of the popular Olsenbanden films Gabriel Axel an Oscarwinner for Babettes Feast in 1987 and Bille August the Oscar Palme dOr and Golden

Denmark and Danish design Denmarks architecture became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country From the 16th century Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark initially to improve the countrys fortifications but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style During the 17th century many impressive buildings were built in the Baroque style both in the capital and the provinces Neoclassicism from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19thcentury National Romantic style The 20th century brought along new architectural styles including expressionism best exemplified by the designs of architect Peder Vilhelm JensenKlint which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions and Nordic Classicism which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalist architecture This in turn has evolved into more recent worldclass masterpieces including Jørn Utzons Sydney Opera House and Johan Otto von Spreckelsens Grande Arche de la Défense in Paris paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as Bjarke Ingels to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of functionalistic design and architecture that was developed in the mid20th century originating in Denmark Danish design is typically applied to industrial design furniture and household objects which have won many international awards The Royal Porcelain Factory is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide Danish design is also a wellknown brand often associated with worldfamous

comedy plays are still being performed In the late 19th century literature was seen as a way to influence society Known as the Modern Breakthrough this movement was championed by Georg Brandes Henrik Pontoppidan awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and J P Jacobsen Romanticism influenced the renowned writer and poet Hans Christian Andersen known for his stories and fairy tales eg The Ugly Duckling The Little Mermaid and The Snow Queen In recent history Johannes Vilhelm Jensen was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature Karen Blixen is famous for her novels and short stories Other Danish writers of importance are Herman Bang Gustav Wied William Heinesen Martin Andersen Nexø Piet Hein Hans Scherfig Klaus Rifbjerg Dan Turèll Tove Ditlevsen Inger Christensen and Peter Høeg Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of Western philosophy Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was Søren Kierkegaard the creator of Christian existentialism Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers including Harald Høffding who later in his life moved on to join the movement of positivism Among Kierkegaards other followers include JeanPaul Sartre who was impressed with Kierkegaards views on the individual and Rollo May who helped create humanistic psychology Another Danish philosopher of note is Grundtvig whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of nonaggressive nationalism in Denmark and who is also influential for his theological and historical works Painting and photography Main articles Danish art and Photography in Denmark While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands the 15th and 16thcentury church frescos which can be seen in many of the countrys older churches are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters The Danish Golden Age which began in the first half of the 19th century was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism typified in the later previous century by history painter Nicolai Abildgaard Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where his students included notable painters such as Wilhelm Bendz Christen Købke Martinus Rørbye Constantin Hansen and Wilhelm Marstrand In 1871 Holger Drachmann and Karl Madsen visited Skagen in the far north of Jutland where they quickly built up one of Scandinavias most successful artists colonies specialising in Naturalism and Realism rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the Academy Hosted by Michael and his wife Anna they were soon joined by PS Krøyer Carl Locher and Laurits Tuxen All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people Similar trends developed on Funen with the Fynboerne who included Johannes Larsen Fritz Syberg and Peter Hansen and on the island of Bornholm with the Bornholm school of painters including Niels Lergaard Kræsten Iversen and Oluf Høst Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area These include impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism abstract painting and surrealism While international cooperation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten 1909–1912 Linien 1930s and 1940s COBRA 1948–51 Fluxus 1960s and 1970s De Unge Vilde 1980s and more recently Superflex founded in 1993 Most

of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad participating in key exhibitions around the world Cuisine Main article Danish
