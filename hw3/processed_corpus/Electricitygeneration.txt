 Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy For electric utilities it is the first process in the delivery of electricity to consumers The other processes electricity transmission distribution and electrical power storage and recovery using pumpedstorage methods are normally carried out by the electric power industry Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators primarily driven by heat engines fuelled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power History The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist Michael Faraday This method is still used today electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet Central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current power transmission using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss Electricity has been generated at central stations since 1882 The first power plants were run on water power or coal and today rely mainly on coal nuclear natural gas hydroelectric wind generators and petroleum with supplementary amounts from solar energy tidal power and geothermal sources The use of powerlines and powerpoles have been significantly important in the distribution of electricity Methods of generating electricity There are seven fundamental methods of directly transforming other forms of energy into electrical energy Static electricity Static electricity form the physical separation and transport of charge examples triboelectric effect and lightning It was the first form discovered and investigated and the electrostatic generator is still used even in modern devices such as the Van de Graaff generator and MHD generators Electromagnetic induction In Electromagnetic induction an electric generator dynamo or alternator transforms kinetic energy into electricity This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on Faradays law It can be experimented by rotating a magnet within closed loops of a conducting material eg copper wire Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate Turbines Almost all electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine driven by wind water steam or burning gas The turbine drives a generator There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy including heat engines hydro wind and tidal power Most electric generation is driven by heat engines The combustion of fossil fuels supplies most of the heat to these engines with a significant fraction from nuclear fission and some from renewable sources The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 currently generates about 80 of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources Power sources include Steam Water is boiled by coal burned in a thermal power plant about 41 of all electricity is generated this way Nuclear fission heat created in a nuclear reactor creates steam Less than 15 of electricity is generated this way Renewables The steam is generated by Biomass Solar thermal energy where solar parabolic troughs and solar power towers concentrate sunlight to heat a heat transfer fluid which is then used to produce steam or Geothermal power Natural gas turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion Combined cycle are driven by both steam and natural gas They generate power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine and use residual heat to generate steam At least 20 of the worlds electricity is generated by natural gas Small turbines can be powered by Diesel engines This is used for back up generation usually at low voltages Most large power grids also use diesel generators originally provided as emergency back up for a specific facility such as a hospital to feed power into the grid during certain circumstances Water Energy is captured from the movement of water From falling water the rise and fall of tides or ocean thermal currents Each driving a water turbine to produce approximately 16 of the worlds electricity The Perth Wave Energy Project is an early production submerged buoy electrical power and direct desalination installation supplying power to HMAS Stirling in Western Australia The windmill was a very early wind turbine In a solar updraft tower wind is artificially produced Before 2010 less than 2 of the worlds electricity was produced from wind Electrochemistry Electrochemistry is the direct transformation of chemical energy into electricity as in a battery Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications Currently most electrochemical power comes from batteries Primary cells such as the common zinccarbon batteries act as power sources directly but many types of cells are used as storage systems rather than primary generation systems Open electrochemical systems known as fuel cells can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges Photovoltaic effect The photovoltaic effect is the transformation of light into electrical energy as in solar cells Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity Although sunlight is free and abundant solar electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than largescale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels Lowefficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30 conversion efficiency are now commercially available Over 40 efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems Until recently photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels Installed capacity is growing by 40 per year led by increases in Germany Japan and the United States Thermoelectric effect Thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electricity as in thermocouples thermopiles and thermionic converters Piezoelectric effect The Piezoelectric effect generates electricity from the mechanical strain of electrically anisotropic molecules or crystals Researchers at the United States Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have developed a piezoelectric generator sufficient to operate a liquidcrystal display using thin films of M13 bacteriophage Piezoelectric devices are used for power generation from mechanical strain particularly in power harvesting Nuclear transformation Nuclear transformation is the creation and acceleration of charged particles examples betavoltaics or alpha particle emission The direct conversion of nuclear potential energy to electricity by beta decay is used only on a small scale In a fullsize nuclear power plant the heat of a nuclear reaction is used to run a heat engine This drives a generator which converts mechanical energy into electricity by magnetic induction Betavoltaics are a type of solidstate power generator which produces electricity from radioactive decay Fluidbased magnetohydrodynamic MHD power generation has been studied as a method for extracting electrical power from nuclear reactors and also from more conventional fuel combustion systems Economics of generation and production of electricity See also Cost of electricity by source The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region The economics vary considerably around the world resulting in widespread selling prices eg the price in Venezuela is 3 cents per kWh while in Denmark it is 40 cents per kWh Hydroelectric plants nuclear power plants thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load supplied by plants which run continuously Nuclear coal oil and gas plants can supply base load Thermal energy is economical in areas of high industrial density as the high demand cannot be met by renewable sources The effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas These plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit However recent disasters in Japan have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power It is not an economically viable source of production where the load varies too much during the annual production cycle and the ability to store the flow of water is limited Due to advancements in technology and with mass production renewable sources other than hydroelectricity solar power wind energy tidal power etc experienced decreases in cost of production and the energy is now in many cases costcomparative with fossil fuels Many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible However their use is frequently limited by their intermittent nature If natural gas prices are below 3 per million British thermal units generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal Production The production of electricity in 2013 was 23322TWh Sources of electricity were coal and peat 41 natural gas 22

power affect concerns about the environment In France only 10 of electricity is generated from fossil fuels the US is higher at 70 and China is at 80 The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source Most scientists agree that emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases from fossil fuelbased electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions in the United States electricity generation accounts for nearly 40 of emissions the largest of any source Transportation emissions are close behind contributing about onethird of US production of carbon dioxide In the United States fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65 of all emissions of sulfur dioxide the main component of acid rain Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of NOx carbon monoxide and particulate matter in the US In July 2011 the UK parliament tabled a motion that levels of carbon emissions from nuclear power were
