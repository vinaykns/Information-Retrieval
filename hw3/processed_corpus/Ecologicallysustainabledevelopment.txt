 Ecologically sustainable development is the environmental component of sustainable development It can be achieved partially through the use of the precautionary principle if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation Also important is the principle of intergenerational equity the present generation should ensure that the health diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations In order for this movement to flourish environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity Political considerations Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to sustainable development Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements work attitudes social morality—particularly interpersonal responsibilities hierarchy of authority quality of scientific education and implementation and degree of domestic stability—especially freedom from social conflict National policy and development planning requires three conditions to permit ecological sustainability actionoriented values to which individuals are committed political authorities that favour longterm ecological benefits over immediate economic gains and a policy with a politically competent constituency Forums for Ecologically Sustainable Development The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980 becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goaloriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global conservation movement The traditional focus became cure rather than Prevention confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society Specifically the concentration on wildlife conservation drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by economic development decisions with a format that targets a wide audience There are three chief conservation objectives Maintaining essential biogeochemical cycles and lifesupport systems Preserving genetic diversity Establishing a sustainable use of species and ecosystems Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities Nicholas Polunin former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an UNESCO conference in Finland The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid population growth proliferation of nuclear weapons and depletion of natural resources Similarly the Global 2000 Report to the President presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies institutions and rates of technologic advancement do not change Findings of this type prompted environmentalists and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions See also Permaculture Greenhouse debt Sustainability Environmental regeneration References External links Australian Government Department of Environment and Water Resources
