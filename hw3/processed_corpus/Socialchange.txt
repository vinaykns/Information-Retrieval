include changes in nature social institutions social behaviours or social relations Definition Social change may refer to the notion of social progress or sociocultural evolution the philosophical

Social change may be driven by cultural religious economic scientific or technological forces Developmental psychology can play a role in social changeSocial change comes about with tangibleintangible resource inputs as social investment Prominent theories Change comes from two sources One source is random or unique factors such as climate weather or the presence of specific groups of people Another source is systematic factors For example successful development has the same general requirements such as a stable and flexible government enough free and available resources and a diverse social organization of society On the whole social change is usually a combination of systematic factors along with some random or unique factors There are many theories of social change Generally a theory of change should include elements such as structural aspects of change like population shifts processes and mechanisms of social change and directions of change Hegelian The classic Hegelian dialectic model of change is based on the interaction of opposing forces Starting from a point of momentary stasis Thesis countered by Antithesis first yields conflict then it subsequently results in a new Synthesis Marxist Marxism presents a dialectical and materialist concept of history Humankinds history is a fundamental struggle between social classes Kuhnian The philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn argues in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions with respect to the Copernican Revolution that people are likely to continue utilizing an apparently unworkable paradigm until a better paradigm is commonly accepted Heraclitan The Greek philosopher Heraclitus used the metaphor of a river to speak of change thus On those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow DK22B12 What Heraclitus seems to be suggesting here later interpretations notwithstanding is that in order for the river to remain the river change must constantly be taking place Thus one may think of the Heraclitan model as parallel to that of a living organism which in order to remain alive must constantly be changing A contemporary application of this approach is shown in the social change theory SEEDSCALE which builds off of the complexity theory subfield of Emergence Daoist The Chinese philosophical work Dao De Jing I8 and II78 uses the metaphor of water as the ideal agent of change Water although soft and yielding will eventually wear away stone Change in this model is to be natural harmonious and steady albeit imperceptible Current social changes Global demographic shifts Main article Demographics of the world One of the most obvious changes currently occurring is the change in the relative global population distribution between countries In the recent decades developing countries became a larger proportion of world population increasing from 68 in 1950 to 82 in 2010 while population of the developed countries has declined from 32 of total world population in 1950 to 18 in 2010 China and India continue to be the largest countries followed by the US as a distant third However population growth throughout the world is slowing Population growth among developed countries has been slowing since the 1950s and is now at 03 annual growth Population growth among the less developed countries excluding the least developed has also been slowing since 1960 and is now at 13 annual growth Population growth among the least developed countries has slowed relatively little and is the highest at 27 annual growth Gendered patterns of work and care In much of the developed world changes from distinct mens and womens work to more gender equal patterns have been economically important since the mid 20th century Both men and women are to be considered to be great
