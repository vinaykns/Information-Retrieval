French République démocratique du Congo also known as DR Congo DRC DROC East Congo CongoKinshasa or simply the Congo is a country located in Central Africa From 1971 to 1997 it was named and is sometimes still called Zaire and from 1908 to 1960 it was called the Belgian Congo The DRC borders the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north Uganda Rwanda Burundi and Tanzania to the east Zambia and Angola to the south the Republic of the Congo to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest It is the secondlargest country in Africa by area and eleventh largest in the world With a population of over 80 million the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populated officially Francophone country the fourth mostpopulated nation in Africa and the eighteenth most populated country in the world The Congolese Civil Wars which began in 1996 brought about the end of Mobutu Sese Sekos 32year reign and devastated the country These wars ultimately involved nine African nations multiple groups of UN peacekeepers and twenty armed groups and resulted in the deaths of 54 million people The Democratic Republic of Congo is extremely rich in natural resources but is politically unstable has a lack of infrastructure deep rooted corruption and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation with little holistic development Besides the capital Kinshasa the other major cities Lubumbashi and MbujiMayi are both mining communities DR Congos largest export is raw minerals with China accepting over 50 of DRCs exports in 2012 As of 2013 according to the Human Development Index HDI DR Congo has a low level of human development ranking 176 out of 187 countries Etymology Further information Congo River The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly known as in chronological order Congo Free State Belgian Congo Republic of the Congo Léopoldville Democratic Republic of the Congo and most recently reverted to its current name from Republic of Zaire The country was known officially as the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1965 to 27 October 1971 when it was changed to the Republic of Zaire In 1992 the Sovereign National Conference voted to change the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo but the change was not put into practice The countrys name was restored by former president LaurentDésiré Kabila following the fall of longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 History Main article History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Early history Main article Early Congolese history The area now known as the DR Congo was populated as early as 80000 years ago as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish Some historians think that Bantu peoples began settling in the extreme northwest of Central Africa at the beginning of the 5th century and then gradually started to expand southward Their propagation was accelerated by the transition from Stone Age to Iron Age techniques The people living in the south and southwest were mostly San Bushmen and huntergatherer groups whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and animal husbandry This led to the displacement of the huntergatherer groups in the east and southeast The 10th century marked the final expansion of the Bantu in WestCentral Africa Rising populations soon made possible intricate local regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in salt iron and copper Congo Free State 1877–1908 Main articles Colonisation of the Congo and Congo Free State Belgian exploration and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s It was first led by Sir Henry Morton Stanley who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King Leopold II of Belgium The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding mainly from Arab–Swahili slave traders such as the infamous Tippu Tip who was well known to Stanley Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony In a succession of negotiations Leopold professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization Association Internationale Africaine actually played one European rival against another Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Conference of Berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property He named it the Congo Free State Leopolds rėgime began various infrastructure projects such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of Leopoldville now Kinshasa which took eight years to complete Nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which Leopold and his associates could extract from the colony In the Free State colonists brutalized the local population into producing rubber for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold who built several buildings in Brussels and Ostend to honor himself and his country To enforce the rubber quotas the army the Force Publique was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy During the period of 1885–1908 millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease In some areas the population declined dramatically – it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River A government commission later concluded that the population of the Congo had been reduced by half during this period but determining precisely how many people died is impossible as no accurate records exist Belgian Congo 1908–60 Main article Belgian Congo In 1908 the Belgian parliament despite initial reluctance bowed to international pressure especially from the United Kingdom and took over the Free State from King Leopold II On 18 October 1908 the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony Executive power went to the Belgian minister of colonial affairs assisted by a Colonial Council Conseil Colonial both located in Brussels The Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo In 1926 the colonial capital moved from Boma to Léopoldville some 300 kilometres 190 mi further upstream into the interior The transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a break but it also featured a large degree of continuity The last Governorgeneral of the Congo Free State Baron Wahis remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold IIs administration with him Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches to the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion – however other priorities such as healthcare and basic education slowly gained in importance Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed a system of European courts and another one of indigenous courts tribunaux indigènes Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration Records show that in 1936 728 Belgian administrators ran the colony The Belgian authorities permitted no political activity in the Congo whatsoever and the Force Publique a locallyrecruited army under Belgian command put down any attempts at rebellion The Belgian population of the colony increased from 1928 in 1910 to nearly 89000 in 1959 The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars During World War I 1914–1918 an initial standoff between the Force Publique and the German colonial army in German East Africa Tanganyika turned into open warfare with a joint AngloBelgian invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the East African Campaign The Force Publique gained a notable victory when it marched into Tabora in September 1916 under the command of General Charles Tombeur after heavy fighting After 1918 Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the Force Publique in the East African campaign with a League of Nations mandate over the previously German colony of RuandaUrundi During World War II the Belgian Congo provided a crucial source of income for the Belgian governmentinexile in London and the Force Publique again participated in Allied campaigns in Africa Belgian Congolese forces under the command of Belgian officers notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Ethiopia in Asosa Bortaï and Saïo under MajorGeneral AugusteEduard Gilliaert during the second East African Campaign Independence and political crisis 1960–65 Main article Congo Crisis In May 1960 a growing nationalist movement the Mouvement National Congolais or MNC Party led by Patrice Lumumba won the parliamentary elections Patrice Lumumba thus became the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The parliament elected as President Joseph Kasavubu of the Alliance des Bakongo ABAKO party Other parties that emerged included the Parti Solidaire Africain or PSA led by Antoine Gizenga and the Parti National du Peuple or PNP led by Albert Delvaux and Laurent Mbariko Congo 1960 dossiers du CRISP Belgium The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name République du Congo Republic of Congo or Republic of the Congo in English Shortly after independence the province of Katanga led by Moise Tshombe and South Kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership Most of the 100000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite As the neighboring French colony of Middle Congo Moyen Congo also chose the name Republic of Congo upon achieving its independence the two countries were more commonly known as CongoLéopoldville and CongoBrazzaville after their capital cities On 5 September 1960 Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba from office Lumumba declared Kasavubus action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed cf Sécession au Katanga – JGeraldLibois Brussels CRISP On 14 September Lumumba was arrested by forces loyal to Joseph Mobutu On 17 January 1961 he was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by Belgianled Katangese troops Amidst widespread confusion and chaos a temporary government was led by technicians Collège des Commissaires with Evariste Kimba The Katanga secession was ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces Several shortlived governments of Joseph Ileo Cyrille Adoula and Moise Tshombe took over in quick succession Lumumba had previously appointed Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army Armée Nationale Congolaise ANC Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Lumumba Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create mutiny With financial support from the United States and Belgium Mobutu paid his soldiers privately The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutus quest to neutralize Kasavubu and Lumumba in a coup by proxy A constitutional referendum after Mobutus coup of 1965 resulted in the countrys official name being changed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again this time to Republic of Zaire Zaire 1971–97 Main article Zaire The new president had the support of the United States because of his staunch opposition to Communism believing that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa A oneparty system was established and Mobutu declared himself head of state He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate Although relative peace and stability were achieved Mobutus government was guilty of severe human rights violations political repression a cult of personality and corruption Corruption became so prevalent the term le mal Zairois or Zairean Sickness meaning gross corruption theft and mismanagement was coined reportedly by Mobutu himself International aid most often in the form of loans enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as onequarter of what had existed in 1960 Zaire became a kleptocracy as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism starting on 1 June 1966 Mobutu renamed the nations cities Léopoldville became Kinshasa the country was now Democratic Republic of The Congo – Kinshasa Stanleyville became Kisangani Elisabethville became Lubumbashi and Coquilhatville became Mbandaka This renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s In 1971 Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River During the 1970s and 1980s he was invited to visit the United States on several occasions meeting with US Presidents Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union US relations with Mobutu cooled as he was no longer deemed necessary as a Cold War ally Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform This atmosphere contributed to Mobutus declaring the Third Republic in 1990 whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee Zaire in 1997 Continental and Civil wars 1996–present Main articles First Congo War Second Congo War and Kivu Conflict By 1996 following the Rwandan Civil War and genocide and the ascension of a Tutsiled government in Rwanda Rwandan Hutu militia forces Interahamwe fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as a base for incursions against Rwanda They allied with the Zairian armed forces FAZ to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu and ultimately to control the mineral resources of Zaire launching the First Congo War The coalition allied with some opposition figures led by LaurentDésiré Kabila becoming the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo AFDL In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa naming himself president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries—he had concerns that the Rwandan officers running his army were plotting a coup to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report directly to the Rwandan president Paul Kagame Rwandan troops retreated to Goma and launched a new Tutsiled rebel military movement called the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie RCD to fight against Kabila while Uganda instigated the creation of new rebel movement called the Movement for the Liberation of Congo MLC led by the Congolese warlord JeanPierre Bemba The two rebel movements along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops started the Second Congo War by attacking the DRC army in 1998 Angolan Zimbabwean and Namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government Kabila was assassinated in 2001 His son Joseph Kabila succeeded him and called for multilateral peacetalks UN peacekeepers MONUC now known as MONUSCO arrived in April 2001 In 2002 and 2003 Bemba intervened in the Central African Republic on behalf of its former president AngeFélix Patassé Talks led to the signing of a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo A transitional government was set up until the election was over A constitution was approved by voters and on 30 July 2006 DRC held its first multiparty elections An electionresult dispute between Kabila and JeanPierre Bemba turned into an allout battle between their supporters in the streets of Kinshasa MONUC took control of the city A new election took place in October 2006 which Kabila won and on December 2006 he was sworn in as President Kivu conflict However Laurent Nkunda a member of RCDGoma an RCD branch integrated to the army defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People CNDP which began an armed rebellion against the government starting the Kivu conflict They were believed to be again backed by Rwanda as a way to tackle the Hutu group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda FDLR In March 2009 after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members In 2012 the leader of the CNDP Bosco Ntaganda and troops loyal to him mutinied and formed the rebel military March 23 Movement claiming a violation of the treaty by the government In the resulting M23 rebellion M23 briefly captured the provincial capital of Goma in November 2012 Neighboring countries particularly Rwanda have been accused of using rebels groups as proxies to gain control of the resourcerich country and of arming rebels a claim they deny In March 2013 the United Nations Security Council authorized the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade the first offensive United Nations peacekeeping unit to neutralize armed groups On 5 November 2013 M23 declared an end to its insurgency Additionally in northern Katanga the MaiMai created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa with Gédéon Kyungu Mutangas Mai Mai Kata Katanga briefly invading the provincial capital of Lubumbashi in 2013 and 400000 persons displaced in the province as of 2013 On and off fighting in the Ituri conflict occurred between the Nationalist and Integrationist Front FNI and the Union of Congolese Patriots UPC who claimed to represent the Lendu and Hema ethnic groups respectively In the northeast Joseph Konys LRA moved from their original bases in Uganda and South Sudan to DR Congo in 2005 and set up camps in the Garamba National Park In 2009 The New York Times reported that people in the Congo continued to die at a rate of an estimated 45000 per month – estimates of the number who have died from the long conflict range from 900000 to 5400000 The death toll is due to widespread disease and famine reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are children under five years of age There have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians of the destruction of property of widespread sexual violence causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and of other breaches of humanitarian and human rights law One study found that more than 400000 women are raped in the Democratic Republic of Congo every year Kabilas term in office and multiple antigovernment protests In 2015 major protests broke out across the country and protesters demanded that Joseph Kabila step down as President The protests began after the passage of a law by the Congolese lower house that if also passed by the Congolese upper house would keep Kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections which he is constitutionally barred from participating in This bill passed however it was gutted of the provision that would keep Joseph Kabila in power until a census took place A census is supposed to take place but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place In 2015 elections were scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace held in the Congo On 27 November Congolese foreign minister Raymond Tshibanda told the press no elections will be held in 2016 after 20 December the end of president Kabilas term In a conference in Madagascar Tshibanda said that Kabilas government had consulted election experts from Congo the United Nations and elsewhere and that it has been decided that the voter registration operation will end on July 31 2017 and that elections will take place in April 2018 Protests broke out in the country on 20 December when Kabilas term in office ended Across the country dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were arrested Geography Main article Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC is located in central subSaharan Africa bordered by clockwise from the southwest Angola the South Atlantic Ocean the Republic of Congo the Central African Republic South Sudan Uganda Rwanda Burundi Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika and Zambia The country lies between latitudes 6°N and 14°S and longitudes 12° and 32°E It straddles the Equator with onethird to the North and twothirds to the South The size of Congo 2345408 square kilometres 905567 sq mi is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain France Germany Sweden and Norway As a result of its equatorial location the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world The annual rainfall can total upwards of 2000 millimetres 80 in in some places and the area sustains the Congo Rainforest the secondlargest rain forest in the world after the Amazon This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast lowlying central basin of the river which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest by mountainous terraces in the west and dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north High glaciated mountains Rwenzori Mountains are found in the extreme eastern region The tropical climate also produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through though they are not mutually exclusive The name for the Congo state is derived in part from the river The river basin meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad tributaries occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly 1000000 km 390000 sq mi The river and its tributaries form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation Major tributaries include the Kasai Sangha Ubangi Ruzizi Aruwimi and Lulonga The sources of the Congo are in the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the western branch of the East African Rift as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru The river flows generally west from Kisangani just below Boyoma Falls then gradually bends southwest passing by Mbandaka joining with the Ubangi River and running into the Pool Malebo Stanley Pool Kinshasa and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool see NASA image Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons collectively known as the Livingstone Falls and runs past Boma into the Atlantic Ocean The river also has the secondlargest flow and the secondlargest watershed of any river in the world trailing the Amazon in both respects The river and a 37 kilometres 23 mi wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the countrys only outlet to the Atlantic The Albertine Rift plays a key role in shaping the Congos geography Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous but due to the rifts tectonic activity this area also experiences volcanic activity occasionally with loss of life The geologic activity in this area also created the famous African Great Lakes three of which lie on the Congos eastern frontier Lake Albert known during the Mobutu era as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko Lake Kivu Unknown until late 1712 Lake Edward known during the Amin era as Lake Idi Amin Dada and Lake Tanganyika Lake Edward and Lake Albert are connected by the Semliki River The Rift valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo making it accessible to mining Cobalt copper cadmium industrial and gemquality diamonds gold silver zinc manganese tin germanium uranium radium bauxite iron ore and coal are all found in plentiful supply especially in the Congos southeastern Katanga region On 17 January 2002 Mount Nyiragongo erupted in Congo with the lava running out at 64 kmh 40 mph and 46 m 50 yd wide One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of Goma killing 45 and leaving 120000 homeless Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption The lava poisoned the water of Lake Kivu killing fish Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway trapping several airplanes Six months after the 2002 eruption nearby Mount Nyamulagira also erupted Mount Nyamulagira also erupted in 2006 and again in January 2010 World Wide Fund for Nature ecoregions located in the Congo include Central Congolian lowland forests – home to the rare bonobo primate The Eastern Congolian swamp forests along the Congo River The Northeastern Congolian lowland forests with one of the richest concentrations of primates in the world Southern Congolian forestsavanna mosaic A large section of the Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands The Albertine Rift montane forests region of high forest runs along the eastern borders of the country World Heritage Sites located in Democratic Republic of Congo are Virunga National Park 1979 Garamba National Park 1980 KahuziBiega National Park 1980 Salonga National Park 1984 and Okapi Wildlife Reserve 1996 Provinces Main articles Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Districts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Further information Administrative divisions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The country is currently divided into the cityprovince of Kinshasa and 25 other provinces The provinces are subdivided into districts which are divided into territories Flora and fauna Main article Wildlife of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great biodiversity including many rare and endemic species such as the common chimpanzee and the bonobo the African forest elephant the mountain gorilla the okapi and the white rhino Five of the countrys national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites the Garumba KahuziBiega Salonga and Virunga National Parks and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most biodiverse African country The civil war and resulting poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work All five sites are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage in Danger Conservationists have particularly worried about primates The Congo is inhabited by several great ape species  — the common chimpanzee Pan troglodytes the bonobo Pan paniscus the eastern gorilla Gorilla beringei and possibly the western gorilla Gorilla gorilla It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction Because of hunting and habitat destruction the chimpanzee the bonobo and the gorilla each of whose populations once numbered in the millions have now dwindled down to only about 200000 gorillas 100000 chimpanzees and possibly only about 10000 bonobos Gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos are all classified as endangered by the World Conservation Union as well as the okapi which is also native to the area BasCongo landscape An Okapi A male Western gorilla Hippopotami The African forest elephant An Angola colobus monkey Bushmeat Over the past century or so the DRC has become the center of what has been called the Central African bushmeat problem regarded by many as a major environmental and socioeconomic crisis Bushmeat is another word for the meat of wild animals typically obtained through trapping usually with wire snares or else with shotguns poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the DRCs numerous military conflicts The bushmeat crisis emerged mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the Congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it A rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions made many Congolese dependent on bushmeat either as an income source selling the meat or for food Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of Kinshasa into prime markets for commercial bushmeat This combination has caused widespread endangerment of local fauna and has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans The hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congos rainforests from both corporate logging and farmers clearing forest landfor agriculture Logging allows hunters much easier access to previouslyunreachable jungle terrain while simultaneously eroding away the habitats of animals Deforestation is accelerating in Central Africa Politics Government Main article Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo After a fouryear interlude between two constitutions with new political institutions established at the various levels of government as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic The 2003 transitional constitution had established a parliament with a bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly The Senate had among other things the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country The executive branch was vested in a 60member cabinet headed by a President and four vice presidents The President was also the Commanderin Chief of the armed forces The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers The 2006 constitution also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic came into effect in February 2006 It had concurrent authority however with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections Under the new constitution the legislature remained bicameral the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government led by a Prime Minister appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly The government – not the President – is responsible to the Parliament The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government whom they elect The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court which was divided into three new institutions The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the Constitutional Court Although located in the Central African UN subregion the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community SADC Corruption Mobutu Sese Seko ruled the DRC which he renamed Zaire from 1965 to 1997 A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million Wed go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million He would go to the bank with Mobutus authority and take out ten Mobutu got one and we took the other nine Mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control leading to an economic collapse in 1996 Mobutu allegedly stole as much as US4–5 billion while in office in July 2009 a Swiss court determined that the statute of limitations had run out on an international asset recovery case of about 67 million of deposits of Mobutus in a Swiss bank and therefore the assets should be returned to Mobutus family President Joseph Kabila established the Commission of Repression of Economic Crimes upon his ascension to power in 2001 Human rights Main article Human rights in the Democratic Republic

women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal The 2013–2014 DHS survey pp 299 found that 748 of women agreed that a husband is justified in beating his wife in certain circumstances The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2006 expressed concern that in the postwar transition period the promotion of womens human rights and gender equality is not seen as a priority The eastern part of the country in particular has been described as the rape capital of the world and the prevalence of sexual violence there described as the worst in the world Female genital mutilation FGM is also practiced in DRC although not on a large scale The prevalence of FGM is estimated at about 5 of women FGM is illegal the law imposes a penalty of two to five years of prison and a fine of 200000 Congolese francs on any person who violates the physical or functional integrity of the genital organs In July 2007 the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern about the situation in eastern DRC A phenomenon of pendulum displacement has developed where people hasten at night to safety According to Yakin Ertürk the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women who toured eastern Congo in July 2007 violence against women in North and South Kivu included unimaginable brutality Ertürk added that Armed groups attack local communities loot rape kidnap women and children and make them work as sexual slaves In December 2008 GuardianFilms of The Guardian released a film documenting the testimony of over 400 women and girls

relations and military See also Foreign relations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in China India Russia Brazil and other developing countries require that developed countries employ new integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring on a continual basis an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs Highlighting the DR Congos importance to United States national security the effort to establish an elite Congolese unit is the latest push by the US to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important region There are economic and strategic incentives to bring more security to the Congo which is rich in natural resources such as cobalt Cobalt is a strategic and critical metal used in many industrial and military applications The largest use of cobalt is in superalloys used to make jet engine parts Cobalt is also used in magnetic alloys and in cutting and wearresistant materials such as cemented carbides The chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing drying agents for paints and inks ground coats for porcelain enamels decolourisers for ceramics and glass and pigments for ceramics paints and plastics The country contains 80 of the worlds cobalt reserves Economy and infrastructure Main article Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The Central Bank of the Congo is responsible for developing and maintaining the Congolese franc which serves as the primary form of currency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo In 2007 The World Bank decided to grant the Democratic Republic of Congo up to 13 billion in assistance funds over the following three years Kinshasa is currently negotiating membership in the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa OHADA The Democratic Republic of Congo is widely considered to be one of the worlds richest countries in natural resources its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US24 trillion The Congo has 70 of the worlds coltan a third of its cobalt more than 30 of its diamond reserves and a tenth of its copper Despite such vast mineral wealth the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically since the mid1980s The African country generated up to 70 of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time By 2005 90 of the DRCs revenues derived from its minerals Exenberger and Hartmann 200710 The countrys woes mean that despite its potential its citizens are among the poorest people on earth DR Congo consistently has the lowest or nearly the lowest nominal GDP per capita in the world The DRC is also one of the twenty lowestranked countries on the Corruption Perception Index Mining Main article Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC is the worlds largest producer of cobalt ore and a major producer of copper and diamonds The latter come from Kasai province in the west By far the largest mines in the DRC are located in southern Katanga province formerly Shaba and are highly mechanized with a capacity of several millions of tons per year of copper and cobalt ore and refining capability for metal ore The DRC is the secondlargest diamondproducing nation in the world and artisanal and smallscale miners account for most of its production At independence in 1960 DRC was the secondmost industrialized country in Africa after South Africa it boasted a thriving mining sector and a relatively productive agriculture sector The First and Second Congo Wars began in 1996 These conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue increased external debt and resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war and associated famine and disease Malnutrition affects approximately two thirds of the countrys population Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict lack of infrastructure and the difficult operating environment The war intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework corruption inflation and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations Conditions improved in late 2002 when a large portion of the invading foreign troops withdrew A number of International Monetary Fund and World Bank missions met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan and President Joseph Kabila began implementing reforms Much economic activity still lies outside the GDP data A United Nations Human Development Index report shows that the human development index of DRC is one of the worst its had in decades Through 2011 the DRC had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries It ranked lower than Niger despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country over 2010s numbers The economy of DRC the second largest country in Africa relies heavily on mining However the smallerscale economic activity from artisanal mining occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data A third of the DRCs diamonds are believed to be smuggled out of the country making it difficult to quantify diamond production levels In 2002 tin was discovered in the east of the country but to date has only been mined on a small scale Smuggling of conflict minerals such as coltan and cassiterite ores of tantalum and tin respectively helped to fuel the war in the Eastern Congo In September 2004 stateowned Gécamines signed an agreement with Global Enterprises Corporate GEC a company formed by the merger of Dan Gertler International DGI with Beny Steinmetz Global to rehabilitate and operate the Kananga and Tilwezembe copper mines The deal was ratified by presidential decree In 2007 a World Bank report reviewed DR Congos three biggest mining contracts finding that the 2005 deals including one with Global Enterprises Company were approved with a complete lack of transparency Mahtani 3 January 2007 Gertler and Steinmetz put GECs 75 share in Komoto Oliveira Virgule KOV the project made of up of Tilwezembe and Kananga along with the Kolwesi concentrator into Nikanor Plc Registered in the Isle of Man reached a market capitalization of 15 billion by 2007 In February 2007 22 of the Nikanor Mining company was owned by the Gertner Family Trust and 14 by Dan Gertler In January 2008 Katanga Mining acquired Nikanor for 452 million In April 2006 Gertlers DGI took a major stake in DEM Mining a cobaltcopper mining and services company based in Katanga In June 2006 Gertler bought Tremalt from the Zimbabwean businessman John Bredenkamp for about 60 million Tremalt had a half share in the Mukondo Mine In 2007 Tremalt was owned by Prairie International Ltd of which Dan Gertlers family trust was a major shareholder Tremalt owned 80 of Savannah Mining which held concessions C17 and C18 in Katanga Province and 50 of the Mukondo project The other 50 of Mukonda was held by Boss Mining which in turn was 80 owned by Central African Mining Exploration Company CAMEC Boss Mining had rented and operated Bredenkamps half of Mukondo Gertler terminated this arrangement Katanga Mining Limited a Swissowned company owns the Luilu Metallurgical Plant which has a capacity of 175000 tonnes of copper and 8000 tonnes of cobalt per year making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world After a major rehabilitation program the company resumed copper production operations in December 2007 and cobalt production in May 2008 In April 2013 anticorruption NGOs revealed that Congolese tax authorities had failed to account for 88 million from the mining sector despite booming production and positive industrial performance The missing funds date from 2010 and tax bodies should have paid them into the central bank Later in 2013 the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative suspended the countrys candidacy for membership due to insufficient reporting monitoring and independent audits but in July 2013 the country improved its accounting and transparency practices to the point where the EITI gave the country full membership Transportation Main article Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult The terrain and climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers to road and rail construction and the distances are enormous across this vast country Chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflicts have led to longterm underinvestment Rail Main article Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Rail transportation is provided by the Congo Railroad Company Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo and the Office National des Transports Congo ONATRA and the Office of the Uele Railways Office des Chemins de fer des Ueles CFU Road The Democratic Republic of the Congo has fewer allweather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa — a total of 2250 km 1400 mi of which only 1226 km 762 mi is in good condition see below To put this in perspective the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500 km 1600 mi eg Matadi to Lubumbashi 2700 km 1700 mi by road The figure of 2250 km 1400 mi converts to 35 km 22 mi of paved road per 1000000 of population Comparative figures for Zambia and Botswana are 721 km 448 mi and 3427 km 2129 mi respectively Three routes in the TransAfrican Highway network pass through DR Congo TripoliCape Town Highway this route crosses the western extremity of the country on National Road No 1 between Kinshasa and Matadi a distance of 285 km 177 mi on one of the only paved sections in fair condition LagosMombasa Highway the DR Congo is the main missing link in this eastwest highway and requires a new road to be constructed before it can function BeiraLobito Highway this eastwest highway crosses Katanga and requires reconstruction over most of its length being an earth track between the Angolan border and Kolwezi a paved road in very poor condition between Kolwezi and Lubumbashi and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the Zambian border Water The Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of navigable waterways Traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around in approximately twothirds of the country Air As of June 2016 DR Congo had one major national airline Congo Airways that offered flights inside DR Congo Congo Airways was based at Kinshasas international airport All air carriers certified by the DRC have been banned from European Union airports by the European Commission due to inadequate safety standards Several international airlines service Kinshasas international airport and a few also offer international flights to Lubumbashi International Airport Energy Main article Energy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo In the Democratic Republic of the Congo there are both coal and crude oil resources that were mainly used domestically in 2008 The Democratic Republic of Congo has infrastructure for hydroelectricity from the Congo River at the Inga dams The Democratic Republic of Congo also possesses 50 of Africas forests and a river system that could provide hydroelectric power to the entire continent according to a UN report on the countrys strategic significance and its potential role as an economic power in central Africa The generation and distribution of electricity is controlled by Société nationale délectricité SNEL Education Main article Education in the Democratic Republic of the Congo In 2014 the literacy rate for the population between the ages of 15 and 49 was estimated to be 759 881 male and 638 female according to a DHS nationwide survey The education system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is governed by three government ministries the Ministère de lEnseignement Primaire Secondaire et Professionnel MEPSP the Ministère de lEnseignement Supérieur et Universitaire MESU and the Ministère des Affaires Sociales MAS Primary education in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not free or compulsory even though the Congolese constitution says it should be Article 43 of the 2005 Congolese Constitution As a result of the 6year civil war in the late 1990searly 2000s over 52 million children in the country did not receive any education Since the end of the civil war the situation has improved tremendously with the number of children enrolled in primary schools rising from 55 million in 2002 to 12 million in 2012 and the number of children enrolled in secondary schools rising from 28 million in 2007 to 39 million in 2012 according to UNESCO Actual school attendance has also improved greatly in recent years with primary school net attendance estimated to be 824 in 2014 824 of children ages 6–11 attended school 834 for boys 806 for girls Health Main article Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Further information HIVAIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo The hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo include the General Hospital of Kinshasa DRC has the worlds secondhighest rate of infant mortality after Chad In April 2011 through aid from Global Alliance for Vaccines a new vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease was introduced around Kinshasa In 2012 it was estimated that about 11 of adults aged 15–49 were living with HIVAIDS Malaria is also a problem Yellow fever also affects DRC Maternal health is poor in DRC According to 2010 estimates DRC has the 17th highest maternal mortality rate in the world According to UNICEF 435 of children under five are stunted Crime and law enforcement Main article Law enforcement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo The Congolese National Police PNC are the primary police force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Demographics Main article Demographics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Largest cities Ethnic groups Over 200 ethnic groups populate the Democratic Republic of the Congo of which the majority are Bantu peoples Together Mongo Luba and Kongo peoples Bantu and MangbetuAzande peoples constitute around 45 of the population The Kongo people are the largest ethnic group in the Democratic Republic of Congo In 2009 the United Nations estimated the countrys population to be 66 million people a rapid increase from 391 million in 1992 despite the ongoing war As many as 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named The most numerous people are the Kongo Luba and Mongo About 600000 Pygmies are the aboriginal people of the DR Congo Although several hundred local languages and dialects are spoken the linguistic variety is bridged both by widespread use of French and the national intermediary languages Kituba Tshiluba Swahili and Lingala Migration Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data However evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines in their numbers Immigration is very diverse in nature refugees and asylumseekers – products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region – constitute an important subset of the population Additionally the countrys large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond There is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world but these movements are not well studied Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role Immigration to the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced According to the International Organization for Migration the number of immigrants in the DRC has fallen from just over 1 million in 1960 to 754000 in 1990 to 480000 in 2005 to an estimated 445000 in 2010 Official figures are unavailable partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the DRC Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants however given neighbouring countries ethnic links to DRC nationals irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon Figures for Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source from 3 to 6 million This discrepancy is due to a lack of official reliable data Emigrants from the DRC are above all longterm emigrants the majority of whom live in Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe 797 and 153 respectively according to estimated 2000 data New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe The DRC has produced a considerable number of refugees and asylumseekers located in the region and beyond These numbers peaked in 2004 when according to UNHCR there were more than 460000 refugees from the DRC in 2008 Congolese refugees numbered 367995 in total 68 of whom were living in other African countries Since 2003 more than 400000 Congolese migrants have been expelled from Angola Religion Main article Religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Christianity is the majority religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo followed by about 95 of the population according to a 2010 Pew Research Center estimate and 80 according to the CIA World Factbook and Pew Research Center 2013 data Indigenous beliefs account for about 18–10 and Islam for 10–12 There are about 35 million Catholics in the country with six archdioceses and 41 dioceses The impact of the Roman Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo is difficult to overestimate Schatzberg has called it the countrys only truly national institution apart from the state Its schools have educated over 60 of the nations primary school students and more than 40 of its secondary students The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals schools and clinics as well as many diocesan economic enterprises including farms ranches stores and artisans shops Kimbanguism was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians Kimbanguism officially the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu now has about three million members primarily among the Bakongo of BasCongo and Kinshasa 62 Protestant denominations are federated under the umbrella of the Church of Christ in Congo It is often simply referred to as the Protestant Church since it covers most of the DRC Protestants With more than 25 million members it constitutes one of the largest Protestant bodies in the world According to the Pew Forum Islam is the faith of 12 of the population According to the CIA World Factbook Muslims make up 10 of the population Islam was introduced and mainly spread by tradersmerchants Congolose Muslims are divided into Sunnis 50 Shias 10 Ahmadis 6 and nondenominational Muslims 14 In 2013 the Allied Democratic Forces a group linked to AlQaeda began carrying out attacks in Congo which killed civilians mostly Christians The first members of the Bahai Faith to live in the country came from Uganda in 1953 Four years later the first local administrative council was elected In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly national administrative council was first elected Though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 1980s due to misrepresentations of foreign governments the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s In 2012 plans were announced to build a national Bahai House of Worship in the country Traditional religions embody such concepts as monotheism animism vitalism spirit and ancestor worship witchcraft and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity New variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread led by USinspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations particularly against children and the elderly Children accused of witchcraft are sent away from homes and family often to live on the street which can lead to physical violence against these children The usual term for these children is enfants sorciers child witches or enfants dits sorciers children accused of witchcraft Nondenominational church organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging exorbitant fees for exorcisms Though recently outlawed children have been subjected in these exorcisms to oftenviolent abuse at the hands of selfproclaimed prophets and priests Languages Main article Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo French is the official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo It is culturally accepted as the lingua franca facilitating communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo According to a 2014 OIF report 33 million Congolese people 47 of the population can read and write in French In the capital city Kinshasa 67 of the population can read and write French and 685 can speak and understand it Approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country but only four have the status of national languages Kituba Kikongo ya leta Lingala Tshiluba and Swahili Although some people speak these regional or trade languages as first languages most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language Lingala was the official language of the colonial army the Force Publique under Belgian colonial rule and remains to this day the predominant language in the armed forces Since the recent rebellions a good part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent When the country was a Belgian colony the Belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period This trend was reversed after independence when French became the sole language of education at all levels Since 1975 the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education with French becoming the sole language of education from the 3rd year onwards but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use French from the first year of school onward Culture Main article Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of ethnic groups and their differing ways of life throughout the country  — from the mouth of the River Congo on the coast upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre to the more densely populated mountains in the far east Since the late 19th century traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by colonialism the struggle for independence the stagnation of the Mobutu era and most recently the First and Second Congo Wars Despite these pressures the customs and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality The countrys 81 million inhabitants at close of 2016 are mainly rural The 30 who live in urban areas have been the most open to Western influences Music Another feature in Congo culture is its music The DRC has blended its ethnic musical sources with Cuban rumba and merengue to give birth to soukous Other African nations produce music genres that are derived from Congolese soukous Some of the African bands sing in Lingala one of the main languages in the DRC The same Congolese soukous under the guidance of le sapeur Papa Wemba has set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designer clothes They came to be known as the fourth generation of Congolese music and mostly come from the former wellknown band Wenge Musica Sports Many sports are played in the Democratic Republic of the Congo including football basketball and rugby The sports are played in numerous stadiums throughout the country including the Stade Frederic Kibassa Maliba Internationally the country is especially famous for its NBA players Dikembe Mutombo is one of the best African basketball players to ever play the game Mutombo is well known for humanitarian projects in his home country Serge Ibaka Bismack Biyombo Christian Eyenga and Emmanuel Mudiay are others who gained significant international attention Since 1968 the Democratic Republic of the Congo has participated in the Olympic Games Food Main article Congolese cuisine Media Newspapers of the DRC include LAvenir La Cité africaine de Matadi La Conscience LObservateur Le
