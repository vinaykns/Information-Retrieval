 For the thermonuclear reaction involving carbon that powers some stars see CNO cycle For organic chemical ringshaped structures see Cyclic compounds The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere pedosphere geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere of the Earth Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make the Earth capable of sustaining life it describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere including carbon sinks The global carbon budget is the balance of the exchanges incomes and losses of carbon between the carbon reservoirs or between one specific loop eg atmosphere biosphere of the carbon cycle An examination of the carbon budget of a pool or reservoir can provide information about whether the pool or reservoir is functioning as a source or sink for carbon dioxide The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier and popularized by Humphry Davy Global climate Carbonbased molecules are crucial for life on Earth because it is the main component of biological compounds Carbon is also a major component of many minerals Carbon also exists in various forms in the atmosphere Carbon dioxide CO2 is partly responsible for the greenhouse effect and is one of the most important humancontributed greenhouse gases In the past two centuries human activities have altered the global carbon cycle most significantly in the atmosphere Although carbon dioxide levels have changed naturally over the past several thousand years human emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere contribute to natural fluctuations Some people think that changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2 are considerably altering weather patterns and indirectly influencing oceanic chemistry but this conclusion is controversial Current carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere exceed measurements from the last 420000 years but are a small fraction of what they were in throughout most of the evolution of life on the planet and levels are rising quickly making it of critical importance to better understand how the carbon cycle works and what its effects are on the global climate Main components The global carbon cycle is now usually divided into the following major reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange The atmosphere The terrestrial biosphere The oceans including dissolved inorganic carbon and living and nonliving marine biota The sediments including fossil fuels fresh water systems and nonliving organic material The Earths interior carbon from the Earths mantle and crust These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical physical geological and biological processes The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth The natural flows of carbon between the atmosphere ocean terrestrial ecosystems and sediments is fairly balanced so that carbon levels would be roughly stable without human influence Atmosphere Main article Atmospheric carbon cycle Carbon in the Earths atmosphere exists in two main forms carbon dioxide and methane Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect Methane produces a larger greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide but it exists in much lower concentrations and is more shortlived than carbon dioxide making carbon dioxide the more important greenhouse gas of the two Carbon dioxide leaves the atmosphere through photosynthesis thus entering the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water oceans lakes etc as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere When dissolved in water carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid which contributes to ocean acidity It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean Human activities over the past two centuries have significantly increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere mainly in the form of carbon dioxide both by modifying ecosystems ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly eg by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete Terrestrial biosphere Main article Terrestrial biological carbon cycle See also Soil carbon See also Carbon sink The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all landliving organisms both alive and dead as well as carbon stored in soils About 500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms while soil holds approximately 1500 gigatons of carbon Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms such as calcium carbonate Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth Autotrophs extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide converting it into organic carbon while heterotrophs receive carbon by consuming other organisms Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle In CO2 measurements this feature is apparent in the Keeling curve It is strongest in the northern hemisphere because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales The combustion or respiration of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere It can also be exported into the oceans through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by erosion or released into the atmosphere through soil respiration Between 1989 and 2008 soil respiration increased by about 01 per year In 2008 the global total of CO2 released from the soil reached roughly 98 billion tonnes about 10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel There are a few plausible explanations for this trend but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of soil organic matter which has increased the flow of CO2 The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of climate change From preindustrial era to 2010 the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO2 prior to 1940 switching subsequently to a net sink Oceans Main article Oceanic carbon cycle Oceans contain the greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in this world and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store The oceans surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere The deep layers concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon DIC is about 15 higher than that of the surface layer DIC is stored in the deep layer for much longer periods of time Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide which is converted into carbonate It can also enter the oceans through rivers as dissolved organic carbon It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through photosynthesis and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the oceans deeper more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as calcium carbonate It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or eventually returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation Oceanic absorption of CO2 is one of the most important forms of carbon sequestering limiting the humancaused rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere However this process is limited by a number of factors Because the rate of CO2 dissolution in the ocean is dependent on the weathering of rocks and this process takes place slower than current rates of human greenhouse gas emissions ocean CO2 uptake will decrease in the future CO2 absorption also makes water more acidic which affects ocean biosystems The projected rate of increasing oceanic acidity could slow the biological precipitation of calcium carbonates thus decreasing the oceans capacity to absorb carbon dioxide Geological carbon cycle The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and thus of global temperatures Most of the earths carbon is stored inertly in the earths lithosphere Much of the carbon stored in the earths mantle was stored there when the earth formed Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere Of the carbon stored in the geosphere about 80 is limestone and its derivatives which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate stored in the shells of marine organisms The remaining 20 is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways Carbon dioxide is released during the metamorphosis of carbonate rocks when they are subducted into the earths mantle This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through volcanoes and hotspots It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of fossil fuels After extraction fossil fuels are burned to release energy thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere Human influence Main article Global warming Since the industrial revolution human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere This interaction between humans and the carbon cycle can be described by carbon rift theory which attributes the nonstop growth of carbon emissions to the capitalism The largest human impact on the carbon cycle is through direct emissions from burning fossil fuels which transfers carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in landuse particularly deforestation Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of calcination of limestone for clinker production which releases CO2 Clinker is an industrial precursor of cement Humans also influence the carbon cycle indirectly by changing the terrestrial and oceanic biosphere Over the past several centuries direct and indirect humancaused land use and land cover change LUCC has led to the loss of biodiversity which lowers ecosystems resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere More directly it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests which hold large amounts of carbon and replaces them generally with agricultural or urban areas Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere Other humancaused changes to the environment change ecosystems productivity and their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere Air pollution for example damages plants and soils while many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher erosion rates washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity Humans also affect the oceanic carbon cycle Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures thus modifying ecosystems Also acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the oceans chemical composition Such changes can have dramatic effects on highly sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs thus limiting the oceans ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere on a regional scale and reducing oceanic biodiversity globally Arctic methane emissions indirectly caused by anthropogenic global warming also affect the carbon cycle and contribute to further warming in what is known as climate change feedback On 12 November 2015 NASA scientists reported that humanmade carbon dioxide CO2 continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans See also Biochar Calvin cycle Carbon cycle rebalancing Carbon dioxide in Earths atmosphere Carbon
