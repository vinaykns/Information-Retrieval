 Olive oil is a liquid fat obtained from olives the fruit of Olea europaea family Oleaceae a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin The oil is produced by pressing whole olives It is commonly used in cooking whether for frying or as a salad dressing It is also used in cosmetics pharmaceuticals and soaps and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps and has additional uses in some religions It is associated with the Mediterranean diet for its possible health benefits The olive is one of three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine the other two are wheat and grapes Olive trees have been grown around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC Spain is the largest producer of olive oil followed by Italy and Greece However per capita consumption is highest in Greece followed by Spain Italy and Morocco Consumption in North America and northern Europe is far less but rising steadily The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar altitude time of harvest and extraction process It consists mainly of oleic acid up to 83 with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid up to 21 and palmitic acid up to 20 Extravirgin olive oil is required to have no more than 08 free acidity and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics it forms as much as 80 of total production in Greece and 65 in Italy but far less in other countries History Early cultivation The olive tree is native to the Mediterranean basin wild olives were collected by Neolithic peoples as early as the 8th millennium BC The wild olive tree originated in Asia Minor or in ancient Greece It is not clear when and where olive trees were first domesticated in Asia Minor in the Levant or somewhere in the Mesopotamian Fertile Crescent Archeological evidence shows that olives were turned into olive oil by 6000 BC and 4500 BC in presentday Palestine and Israel Until 1500 BC eastern coastal areas of the Mediterranean were most heavily cultivated Evidence also suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2500 BC The earliest surviving olive oil amphorae date to 3500 BC Early Minoan times though the production of olive oil is assumed to have started before 4000 BC Olive trees were certainly cultivated by the Late Minoan period 1500 BC in Crete and perhaps as early as the Early Minoan The cultivation of olive trees in Crete became particularly intense in the postpalatial period and played an important role in the islands economy as it did across the Mediterranean Recent genetic studies suggest that species used by modern cultivators descend from multiple wild populations but a detailed history of domestication is not yet forthcoming History and trade Olive trees and oil production in the Eastern Mediterranean can be traced to archives of the ancient citystate Ebla 2600–2240 BC which were located on the outskirts of the Syrian city Aleppo Here some dozen documents dated 2400 BC describe lands of the king and the queen These belonged to a library of clay tablets perfectly preserved by having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace A later source is the frequent mentions of oil in the Tanakh Dynastic Egyptians before 2000 BC imported olive oil from Crete Syria and Canaan and oil was an important item of commerce and wealth Remains of olive oil have been found in jugs over 4000 years old in a tomb on the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea Sinuhe the Egyptian exile who lived in northern Canaan about 1960 BC wrote of abundant olive trees Besides food olive oil has been used for religious rituals medicines as a fuel in oil lamps soapmaking and skin care application The Minoans used olive oil in religious ceremonies The oil became a principal product of the Minoan civilization where it is thought to have represented wealth Olive oil a multipurpose product of Mycenaean Greece c 16001100 BC at that time was a chief export Olive tree growing reached Iberia and Etruscan cities well before the 8th century BC through trade with the Phoenicians and Carthage then was spread into Southern Gaul by the Celtic tribes during the 7th century BC The first recorded oil extraction is known from the Hebrew Bible and took place during the Exodus from Egypt during the 13th century BC During this time the oil was derived through handsqueezing the berries and stored in special containers under guard of the priests A commercial mill for nonsacramental use of oil was in use in the tribal Confederation and later in 1000 BC the Fertile Crescent an area consisting of presentday Palestine Lebanon and Israel Over 100 olive presses have been found in Tel Miqne Ekron where the Biblical Philistines also produced oil These presses are estimated to have had output of between 1000 and 3000 tons of olive oil per season Many ancient presses still exist in the Eastern Mediterranean region and some dating to the Roman period are still in use today Olive oil was common in ancient Greek and Roman cuisine According to Herodotus Apollodorus Plutarch Pausanias Ovid and other sources the city of Athens obtained its name because Athenians considered olive oil essential preferring the offering of the goddess Athena an olive tree over the offering of Poseidon a spring of salt water gushing out of a cliff The Spartans and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the gymnasia From its beginnings early in the 7th century BC the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of the Hellenic city states together with athletes training in the nude and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense Olive trees were planted throughout the entire Mediterranean basin during evolution of the Roman Republic and Empire According to the historian Pliny the Elder Italy had excellent olive oil at reasonable prices by the 1st century AD—the best in the Mediterranean he maintained The importance and antiquity of olive oil can be seen in the fact that the English word oil derives from c 1175 olive oil from AngloFr and ONFr olie from OFr oile 12c ModFr huile from L oleum oil olive oil cf It olio from Gk elaion olive tree which may have been borrowed through trade networks from the Semitic Phoenician use of elyon meaning superior probably in recognized comparison to other vegetable or animal fats available at the time Robin Lane Fox suggests that the Latin borrowing of Greek elaion for oil Latin oleum is itself a marker for improved Greek varieties of oilproducing olive already present in Italy as Latin was forming brought by Euboean traders whose presence in Latium is signaled by remains of their characteristic pottery from the mid8th century Varieties Main article List of olive cultivars There are many different olive varieties or olives each with a particular flavor texture and shelf life that make them more or less suitable for different applications such as direct human consumption on bread or in salads indirect consumption in domestic cooking or catering or industrial uses such as animal feed or engineering applications Production and consumption In 2013 world production of virgin olive oil was 28 million tonnes table a 20 decrease from the 2012 world production of 35 million tonnes Spain produced 11 million tonnes or 39 of world production in 2013 75 of Spains production derives from the region of Andalucía particularly within Jaén province which produces 70 of olive oil in Spain The world’s largest olive oil mill almazara in Spanish capable of processing 2500 tons of olives per day is in the town of Villacarrillo Jaén Although Italy is a net importer of olive oil it produced 442000 tonnes in 2013 or 16 of the worlds production table Major Italian producers are known as Città dellOlio oil cities including Lucca Florence and Siena in Tuscany The largest production however is harvested in Apulia and Calabria Greece accounted for 11 of world production in 2013 Australia now produces a substantial amount of olive oil Many Australian producers only make premium oils while a number of corporate growers operate groves of a million trees or more and produce oils for the general market Australian olive oil is exported to Asia Europe and the United States In North America Italian and Spanish olive oils are the bestknown and topquality extravirgin olive oil from Italy Spain Portugal and Greece are sold at high prices often in prestige packaging A large part of US olive oil imports come from Italy Spain and Turkey The United States produces olive oil in California Arizona Texas and Georgia Uses Culinary use Olive oil is the main cooking oil in countries surrounding the Mediterranean and it forms one of the three staple food plants of Mediterranean cuisine the other two being wheat as in pasta bread and couscous and the grape used as a dessert fruit and for wine Extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a salad dressing and as an ingredient in salad dressings It is also used with foods to be eaten cold If uncompromised by heat the flavor is stronger It also can be used for sautéing The higher the temperature to which the olive oil is heated the higher the risk of compromising its taste When extra virgin olive oil is heated above 210–216 °C 410–421 °F depending on its free fatty acid content the unrefined particles within the oil are burned This leads to deteriorated taste Also the pronounced taste of extra virgin olive oil is not a taste most people like to associate with their deep fried foods Refined olive oils are perfectly suited for deep frying foods and should be replaced after several uses Choosing a coldpressed olive oil can be similar to selecting a wine The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish An important issue often not realized in countries that do not produce olive oil is that the freshness makes a big difference A very fresh oil as available in an oil producing region tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere In time oils deteriorate and become stale Oneyearold oil may be still pleasant to the taste but it is less fragrant than fresh oil After the first year olive oil should be used for cooking not for foods to be eaten cold like salads The taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors – riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil Religious use Olive oil also has religious symbolism for healing and strength and to consecration—setting a person or place apart for special work This may be related to its ancient use as a medicinal agent and for cleansing athletes by slathering them in oil then scraping them Judaism In Jewish observance olive oil is the only fuel allowed to be used in the sevenbranched Menorah in the Mishkan service during the Exodus of the tribes of Israel from Egypt and later in the permanent Temple in Jerusalem It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers A menorah similar to the Menorah used in the Mishkan is now used during the holiday of Hanukkah that celebrates the miracle of the last of such containers being found during the rededication of the Temple 163 BC when its contents lasted for far longer than they were expected to allowing more time for more oil to be made Although candles can be used to light the hanukkiah oil containers are preferred to imitate the original Menorah Another use of oil in Jewish religion is for anointing the kings of the Kingdom of Israel originating from King David Tzidkiyahu was the last anointed King of Israel Christianity The Roman Catholic Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil for the Oil of Catechumens used to bless and strengthen those preparing for Baptism and Oil of the Sick used to confer the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick or Unction Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as balsam is consecrated by bishops as Sacred Chrism which is used to confer the sacrament of Confirmation as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit in the rites of Baptism and the ordination of priests and bishops in the consecration of altars and churches and traditionally in the anointing of monarchs at their coronation The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints and other religions use olive oil when they need to consecrate an oil for anointings Eastern Orthodox Christians still use oil lamps in their churches home prayer corners and in the cemeteries A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a halfinch of water and filled the rest with olive oil The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil To douse the flame the float is carefully pressed down into the oil Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries In the Orthodox Church olive oil is a product not consumed during lent or penance while Orthodox monks use it sparingly in their diet Exceptions are in feast days and Sundays Skin care Olive oil has a long history of being used as a home remedy for skincare Egyptians used it alongside beeswax as a cleanser moisturizer and antibacterial agent since pharaonic times In ancient Greece olive oil was used during massage to prevent sports injuries relieve muscle fatigue and eliminate lactic acid buildup In 2000 Japan was the top importer of olive oil in Asia 13000 tons annually because consumers there believe both the ingestion and topical application of olive oil to be good for skin and health Olive oil is popular for use in massaging infants and toddlers but scientific evidence of its efficacy is mixed One analysis of olive oil versus mineral oil found that when used for infant massage olive oil can be considered a safe alternative to sunflower grapeseed and fractionated coconut oils This stands true particularly when it is mixed with a lighter oil like sunflower which would have the further effect of reducing the already low levels of free fatty acids present in olive oil Another trial stated that olive oil lowered the risk of dermatitis for infants in all gestational stages when compared with emollient cream However yet another study on adults found that topical treatment with olive oil significantly damages the skin barrier when compared to sunflower oil and that it may make existing atopic dermatitis worse The researchers concluded that due to the negative outcome in adults they do not recommend the use of olive oil for the treatment of dry skin and infant massage Applying olive oil to the skin does not help prevent or reduce stretch marks Other Olive oil is also a natural and safe lubricant and can be used to lubricate kitchen machinery grinders blenders cookware etc It can also be used for illumination oil lamps or as the base for soaps and detergents Some cosmetics also use olive oil as their base Olive oil may be used in soap making as lamp oil a lubricant or as a substitute for machine oil Olive oil has also been used as both solvent and ligand in the synthesis of cadmium selenide quantum dots In one study monounsaturated fats such as from olive oil benefited mood decreased anger and increased physical activity Regulation Main article Olive oil regulation and adulteration The International Olive Council IOC is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce olives or products derived from olives such as olive oil The IOC officially governs 95 of international production and holds great influence over the rest The EU regulates the use of different protected designation of origin labels for olive oils The United States is not a member of the IOC and is not subject to its authority but on October 25 2010 the US Department of Agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the IOC with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the US Additionally US Customs regulations on country of origin state that if a nonorigin nation is shown on the label then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer Yet most major US brands continue to put imported from Italy on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print In fact olive oil labeled Italian often comes from Turkey Tunisia Morocco Spain and Greece This makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin Commercial grades All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing This paste is then malaxed slowly churned or mixed to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press traditional method or centrifugation modern method After extraction the remnant solid substance called pomace still contains a small quantity of oil To classify its organoleptic qualities olive oil is judged by a panel of trained tasters in a blind taste test One parameter used to characterise an oil is its acidity In this context acidity is not chemical acidity in the sense of pH but the percent measured by weight of free oleic acid Measured by quantitative analysis acidity is a measure of the hydrolysis of the oils triglycerides as the oil degrades more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity Another measure of the oils chemical degradation is the peroxide value which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized damaged by free radicals leading to oxidative rancidity Phenolic acids present in olive oil also add acidic sensory properties to aroma and flavor The grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as Virgin means the oil was produced by the use of mechanical means only with no chemical treatment The term virgin oil with reference to production method includes all grades of virgin olive oil including Extra Virgin Virgin Ordinary Virgin and Lampante Virgin olive oil products depending on quality see below Lampante virgin oil is olive oil extracted by virgin mechanical methods but not suitable for human consumption without further refining lampante is Italian for glaring referring to the earlier use of such oil for burning in lamps Lampante virgin oil can be used for industrial purposes or refined see below to make it edible Refined Olive Oil is the olive oil obtained from any grade of virgin olive oil by refining methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure The refining process removes colour odour and flavour from the olive oil and leaves behind a very pure form of olive oil that is tasteless colourless and odourless and extremely low in free fatty acids Olive oils sold as the grades extravirgin olive oil and virgin olive oil therefore cannot contain any refined oil Crude Olive Pomace Oil is the oil obtained by treating olive pomace the leftover paste after the pressing of olives for virgin olive oils with solvents or other physical treatments to the exclusion of oils obtained by reesterification processes and of any mixture with oils of other kinds It is then further refined into Refined Olive Pomace Oil and once reblended with virgin olive oils for taste is then known as Olive Pomace Oil International Olive Council In countries that adhere to the standards of the International Olive Council IOC as well as in Australia and under the voluntary USDA labeling standards in the United States Extravirgin olive oil Comes from virgin oil production only and is of higher quality among other things it contains no more than 08 free acidity and is judged to have a superior taste having some fruitiness and no defined sensory defects Extravirgin olive oil accounts for less than 10 of oil in many producing countries the percentage is far higher in the Mediterranean countries Greece 80 Italy 65 Spain 50 Virgin olive oil Comes from virgin oil production only but is of slightly lower quality with free acidity of up to 15 and is judged to have a good taste but may include some sensory defects Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from virgin olive oils by refining methods that do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure It has a free acidity expressed as oleic acid of not more than 03 grams per 100 grams 03 and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard This is obtained by refining virgin olive oils with a high acidity level or organoleptic defects that are eliminated after refining Note that no solvents have been used to extract the oil but it has been refined with the use of charcoal and other chemical and physical filters Oils labeled as Pure olive oil or Olive oil are primarily refined olive oil with a small addition of virginproduction to give taste Olive pomace oil is refined pomace olive oil often blended with some virgin oil It is fit for consumption but may not be described simply as olive oil It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil making it unfashionable among connoisseurs however it has the same fat composition as regular olive oil giving it the same health benefits It also has a high smoke point and thus is widely used in restaurants as well as home cooking in some countries United States As the United States is not a member the IOC retail grades have no legal meaning there but on October 25 2010 the United States Department of Agriculture USDA established Standards for Grades of Olive Oil and OlivePomace Oil which closely parallel the IOC standards US Extra Virgin Olive Oil for oil with excellent flavor and odor and free fatty acid content of not more than 08 g per 100 g 08 US Virgin Olive Oil for oil with reasonably good flavor and odor and free fatty acid content of not more than 2 g per 100 g 2 US Virgin Olive Oil Not Fit For Human Consumption Without Further Processing is a virgin mechanicallyextracted olive oil of poor flavor and odor equivalent to the IOCs lampante oil US Olive Oil is a mixture of virgin and refined oils US Refined Olive Oil is an oil made from refined oils with some restrictions on the processing These grades are voluntary Certification is available for a fee from the USDA Label wording Different names for olive oil indicate the degree of processing the oil has undergone as well as the quality of the oil Extravirgin olive oil is the highest grade available followed by virgin olive oil The word virgin indicates that the olives have been pressed to extract the oil no heat or chemicals have been used during the extraction process and the oil is pure and unrefined Virgin olive oils contain the highest levels of polyphenols antioxidants that have been linked with better health Olive Oil which is sometimes denoted as being Made from refined and virgin olive oils is a blend of refined olive oil with a virgin grade of olive oil Pure Classic Light and ExtraLight are terms introduced by manufacturers in countries that are nontraditional consumers of olive oil for these products to indicate both their composition of being only 100 olive oil and also the varying strength of taste to consumers Contrary to a common consumer belief they do not have fewer calories than Extravirgin oil as implied by the names Cold pressed or Cold extraction means that the oil was not heated over a certain temperature usually 27 °C 80 °F during processing thus retaining more nutrients and undergoing less degradation The difference between Cold Extraction and Cold Pressed is regulated in Europe where the use of a centrifuge the modern method of extraction for large quantities must be labelled as Cold Extracted while only a physically pressed olive oil may be labelled as Cold Pressed In many parts of the world such as Australia producers using centrifugal extraction still label their products as Cold Pressed First cold pressed means that the fruit of the olive was crushed exactly one timeie the first press The cold refers to the temperature range of the fruit at the time it is crushed In Calabria Italy the olives are collected in October In regions like Tuscany or Liguria the olives collected in November and ground often at night are too cold to be processed efficiently without heating The paste is regularly heated above the environmental temperatures which may be as low as 10–15 °C to extract the oil efficiently with only physical means Olives pressed in warm regions like Southern Italy or Northern Africa may be pressed at significantly higher temperatures although not heated While it is important that the pressing temperatures be as low as possible generally below 25 °C there is no international reliable definition of cold pressed Furthermore there is no second press of virgin oil so the term first press means only that the oil was produced in a press vs other possible methods Protected designation of origin PDO and protected designation of origin PGI refer to olive oils with exceptional properties and quality derived from their place of origin as well as from the way of their production The label may indicate that the oil was bottled or packed in a stated country This does not necessarily mean that the oil was produced there The origin of the oil may sometimes be marked elsewhere on the label it may be a mixture of oils from more than one country The US Food and Drug Administration permitted a claim on olive oil labels stating Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about two tablespoons 23 g of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease Adulteration There have been allegations particularly in Italy and Spain that regulation can be sometimes lax and corrupt Major shippers are claimed to routinely adulterate olive oil so that only about 40 of olive oil sold as extra virgin in Italy actually meets the specification In some cases colza oil extracted from rapeseed with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil under which every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used for blended oils In February 2008 however EU officials took issue with the new law stating that under EU rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory Under EU rules olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil Extra Virgin olive oil has strict requirements and is checked for sensory defects that include rancid fusty musty winey vinegary and muddy sediment These defects can occur for different reasons The most common are Raw material olives infected or battered Inadequate harvest with contact between the olives and soil In March 2008 400 Italian police officers conducted Operation Golden Oil arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a largescale scheme to relabel oils from other Mediterranean nations as Italian In April 2008 another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soybean oil and selling it as extra virgin olive oil both in Italy and abroad 25000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported On March 15 2011 the prosecutors office in Florence Italy working in conjunction with the forestry department indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS which recently changed its name to Deoleo The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that the case is based on an irregularity in the documents In February 2012 an international olive oil scam was alleged by Spanish police to have taken place in which palm avocado sunflower and other cheaper oils were passed off as Italian olive oil Police said the oils were blended in an industrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature The oils were not toxic and posed no health risk according to a statement by the Guardia Civil Nineteen people were arrested following the yearlong joint probe by the police and Spanish tax authorities part of what they call Operation Lucerna Using tiny print to state the origin of blended oil is used as a legal loophole by manufacturers of adulterated and mixed olive oil Journalist Tom Mueller has investigated crime and adulteration in the olive oil business publishing the article Slippery Business in New Yorker magazine followed by the 2011 book Extra Virginity On 3 January 2016 Bill Whitaker presented a program on CBS News including interviews with Mueller and with Italian authorities It was reported that in the previous month 5000 tons of adulterated olive oil had been sold in Italy and that organised crime was heavily involved—the term Agrimafia was used The point was made by Mueller that the profit margin on adulterated olive oil was three times that on the illegal narcotic drug cocaine He said that over 50 of olive oil sold in Italy was adulterated as was 7580 of that sold in the US Whitaker reported that 3 samples of extra virgin olive oil had been bought in a US supermarket and tested two of the three samples did not meet the required standard and one of them—with a topselling US brand—was exceptionally poor Global consumption Greece has by far the largest per capita consumption of olive oil worldwide over 24 liters 53 imp gal 63 US gal per person per year Spain and Italy around 14 l Tunisia Portugal Syria Jordan and Lebanon around 8 l Northern Europe and North America consume far less around 07 l but the consumption of olive oil outside its home territory has been rising steadily Global market The main producing and consuming countries are Extraction Main article Olive oil extraction Olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means Green olives usually produce more bitter oil and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened The process is generally as follows The olives are ground into paste using large millstones traditional method or steel drums modern method If ground with mill stones the olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes A shorter grinding process may result in a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor After grinding the olive paste is spread on fiber disks which are stacked on top of each other in a column then placed into the press Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste This liquid still contains a significant amount of water Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity oil is less dense than water This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation which is much faster and more thorough The centrifuges have one exit for the heavier watery part and one for the oil Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles In modern steel drum mills the grinding process takes about 20 minutes After grinding the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container malaxation where the microscopic oil drops unite into bigger drops which facilitates the mechanical extraction The paste is then pressed by centrifugation the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before The oil produced by only physical mechanical means as described above is called virgin oil Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria low free acidity no or very little organoleptic defects A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions a drought during the flowering phase for example can result in a lower quality virgin oil It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years so greater harvests occur in alternate years the year inbetween is when the tree yields less However the quality is still dependent on the weather Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has not been filtered suggesting a different taste Fresh unfiltered olive oil usually has a slightly cloudy appearance and is therefore sometimes called cloudy olive oil This form of olive oil used to be popular only among olive oil small scale producers but is now becoming trendy in line with consumers demand for products that are perceived to be less processed The remaining paste pomace still contains a small quantity about 5–10 of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing but only with chemical solvents This is done in specialised chemical plants not in the oil mills The resulting oil is not virgin but pomace oil The term first press sometimes found on bottle labels is today meaningless as there is no second press it comes from ancient times of stone presses when virgin oil was the one produced by battering the olives The label term coldextraction on extra virgin olive oils indicates that the olive grinding and stirring was done at a temperature of maximum 25 °C 77 °F as treatment in higher temperatures risks decreasing the olive oils quality texture taste and aroma Constituents Olive oil is composed mainly of the mixed triglyceride esters of oleic acid and palmitic acid and of other fatty acids along with traces of squalene up to 07 and sterols about 02 phytosterol and tocosterols The composition varies by cultivar region altitude time of harvest and extraction process Phenolic composition Olive oil contains phenolics such as esters of tyrosol hydroxytyrosol oleocanthal and oleuropein having acidic properties that give extravirgin unprocessed olive oil its aroma and bitter pungent taste Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds among which is elenolic acid a marker for maturation of olives Oleuropein together with other closely related compounds such as 10hydroxyoleuropein ligstroside and 10hydroxyligstroside are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid Other phenolic constituents include flavonoids lignans and pinoresinol Nutrition One tablespoon of olive oil 135 g contains the following

of DV Potential health effects fat and polyphenol composition Olive oil consumption is thought to affect cardiovascular health It has been suggested that longterm consumption of small quantities of the polyphenol oleocanthal from olive oil may be responsible in part for the low incidence of heart disease associated with a Mediterranean diet Epidemiological studies indicate that a higher proportion of monounsaturated fats in the diet may be linked with a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease There is preliminary evidence that regular consumption of olive oil may lower risk of allcause mortality and several chronic diseases In a comprehensive scientific review by the European Food Safety Authority EFSA in 2011 health claims on olive oil were approved for protection by its polyphenols against oxidation of blood lipids and for the contribution to the maintenance of normal blood LDLcholesterol levels by replacing saturated fats in the diet with oleic acid Commission Regulation EU 4322012 of 16 May 2012 A causeandeffect relationship has not been adequately established for consumption of olive oil and maintaining normal fasting blood concentrations of triglycerides normal blood HDLcholesterol concentrations and normal blood glucose concentrations A 2011 metaanalysis concluded that olive oil consumption may play a protective role against the development of any type of cancer but could not clarify whether the beneficial effect is due to olive oil monounsaturated fatty acid content or its antioxidant components A 2014 metaanalysis concluded that an elevated consumption of olive oil is associated with reduced risk of allcause mortality cardiovascular events and stroke while monounsaturated fatty acids of mixed animal and plant origin showed no significant effects In the United States producers of olive oil may place the following restricted health claim on product labels This decision was announced November 1 2004 after application to the FDA by producers Similar labels are permitted for foods rich in omega3 fatty acids such as walnuts and hemp seed See also Food portal Amurca List of ancient dishes and foods List of cuisines List of dips
