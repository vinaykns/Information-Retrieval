portable light fixture composed of a LED lamp a photovoltaic solar panel and a rechargeable battery Solar maximum – or solar max is the period of greatest solar activity in the solar cycle of the Sun Solar minimum – the period of least solar activity in the solar cycle of the sun Solar mirror – a reflective surface used for gathering and reflecting solar energy in a system being powered by solar energy Solar nebula – Solar neon – neon that has been made in the Sun and transmitted to Earth as ions in the solar wind Solar Orbiter – SolO is a planned Sunobserving satellite under development by the European Space Agency ESA Solar oven – Solar photovoltaics – Solar pond – a pool of saltwater which acts as a largescale solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage for supplying thermal energy Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert – which supply power to the electricity grid Solar power satellite – Solar power tower – also known as central tower power plants or heliostat power plants or power towers is a type of solar furnace using a tower to receive the focused sunlight Solarpowered desalination unit – a device capable of harnessing energy from the sun to produce portable water from saline water through direct or indirect methods Solar prominence – a large bright feature extending outward from the Suns surface often in a loop shape Solar proton event – or proton storm occurs when protons emitted by the Sun become accelerated to very high energies either close to the Sun during a solar flare or in interplanetary space by the shocks associated with coronal mass ejections Solar radiation pressure – Solar radiation – Solar Riser – Solar sail – also called light sails or photon sails are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure also called solar pressure of light from a star to push large ultrathin mirrors to high speeds Solar savings fraction – or solar fraction f is the amount of energy provided by the solar technology divided by the total energy required Solar shingles – also called photovoltaic shingles are solar cells designed to look like conventional asphalt shingles Solar thermal collector – a solar collector designed to collect heat by absorbing sunlight Solar thermal electricity – Solar Total Energy Project STEP – was the worlds first and largest solar thermal cogeneration project having an industrial application Solar variation theory – Solar variation – the change in the amount of radiation emitted by the Sun see Solar radiation and in its spectral distribution over years to millennia Solar vehicle – an electric vehicle powered completely or significantly by direct solar energy Solar water disinfection – also known as SODIS is a method of disinfecting water using only sunlight and plastic PET bottles Solar water heating SWH – or solar hot water SHW systems comprise several innovations and many mature renewable energy technologies that have been well established for many years Solarcharged vehicle – SolarEdge – a provider of power optimizer solar inverter and monitoring solutions for photovoltaic arrays Solarium – similar to a sunroom a room built largely of glass to afford exposure to the sun SolarPACES – Solar Power and Chemical Energy Systems is an international programme of the International Energy Agency to further the collaborative development testing and marketing of concentrating solar power plants Solnova Solar Power Station – a large CSP power station made up of five separate units of 50 MW each Sopogy – a solar thermal technology supplier was founded in 2002 at the Honolulu Hawaiibased clean technology incubator South African Solar Challenge – an alternative fuel vehicle auto racing challenge in South Africa with classes for hybrid vehicles electric vehicles solar vehicles and biofuelpowered vehicles Spacebased solar power –  Part of the solar energy is lost on its way through the atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption Sun tanning – or simply tanning is the process whereby skin color is darkened or tanned Sunburn – a burn to living tissue such as skin which is produced by overexposure to ultraviolet UV radiation commonly from the suns rays Sunscreen – also commonly known as sunblock sun tan lotion sun screen sun cream or block out is a lotion spray gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the suns ultraviolet UV radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus helps protect against sunburn Sunshade – Total spectrum solar concentrator – a device used to optimise the efficiency of solar power Trombe wall – a sunfacing wall separated from the outdoors by glass and an air space which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the interior at night The Solar Project – consists of the Solar One Solar Two and Solar Tres solar thermal power plants based in the Mojave Desert USA and AndalucÃa Spain Topaz Solar Farm – a 550 megawatt MW solar photovoltaic power plant being built in San Luis Obispo County California References External links Find more aboutSolar energyat Wikipedias sister projects Definitions from Wiktionary Media from Commons News from
