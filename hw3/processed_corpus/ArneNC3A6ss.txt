philosopher who coined the term deep ecology and was an important intellectual and inspirational figure within the environmental movement of the late twentieth century Næss cited Rachel Carsons 1962 book Silent Spring as being a key influence in his vision of deep ecology Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian nonviolence and on several occasions participated in direct action Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early postwar period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems Naess believed that the environmental crisis of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged He thereby distinguished between what he called deep and shallow ecological thinking In contrast to the prevailing utilitarian pragmatism of western businesses and governments he advocated that a true understanding of nature would give rise to a point of view that appreciates the value of biological diversity understanding that each living thing is dependent on the existence of other creatures in the complex web of interrelationships that is the natural world Life and career Næss was born in Slemdal Oslo Norway the son of Christine Dekke and Ragnar Eide Næss In 1939 Næss was the youngest person to be appointed full professor at the University of Oslo and the only professor of philosophy in the country at the time He was a noted mountaineer who in 1950 led the expedition that made the first ascent of Tirich Mir 7708 m The Tvergastein hut in the Hallingskarvet massif played an important role in Ecosophy T as T is said to represent his mountain hut Tvergastein In 1958 he founded the interdisciplinary journal of philosophy Inquiry In 1970 together with a large number of protesters he chained himself to rocks in front of Mardalsfossen a waterfall in a Norwegian fjord and refused to descend until plans to build a dam were dropped Though the demonstrators were carried away by police and the dam was eventually built the demonstration launched a more activist phase of Norwegian environmentalism In 1996 he won the Swedish Academy Nordic Prize known as the little Nobel In 2005 he was decorated as a Commander with Star of the Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav for socially useful work Næss was a minor political candidate for the Norwegian Green Party in 2005 Philosophy Næss Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten 1936 anticipated many themes familiar in postwar analytic philosophy Næss main philosophical work from the 1950s was entitled Interpretation and Preciseness This was an application of set theory to the problems of language interpretation extending the work of semanticists such as Charles Kay Ogden in The Meaning of Meaning A simple way of explaining it is that any given utterance word phrase or sentence can be considered as having different potential interpretations depending on prevailing language norms the characteristics of particular persons or groups of users and the language situation in which the utterance occurred These differing interpretations are to be formulated in more precise language represented as subsets of the original utterance Each subset can in its turn have further subsets theoretically ad infinitum The advantages of this conceptualisation of interpretation are various It enables systematic demonstration of possible interpretation making possible evaluation of which are the more and less reasonable interpretations It is a logical instrument for demonstrating language vagueness undue generalisation conflation pseudoagreement and effective communication Næss developed a simplified practical textbook embodying these advantages entitled Communication and Argument which became a valued introduction to this pragmatics or language logic and was used over many decades as a sine qua non for the preparatory examination at the University of Oslo later known as Examen Philosophicum Exphil Recommendations for public debate Communication and Argument included his recommendations for objective public debate Næss argued for adhering to the following rules to make discussions as fruitful and pleasant as possible Avoid tendentious irrelevance Examples Personal attacks claims of opponents motivation explaining reasons for an argument Avoid tendentious quoting Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate Avoid tendentious ambiguity Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism Avoid tendentious use of straw men Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold Avoid tendentious statements of fact Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete and one should not withhold relevant information Avoid tendentious tone of presentation Examples irony sarcasm pejoratives exaggeration subtle or open threats For many years these points were part of two compulsory courses in philosophy taught in Norwegian universities Examen philosophicum and Examen facultatum Ecosophy T Ecosophy T as distinct from deep ecology was originally the name of his personal philosophy Others such as Warwick Fox have interpreted deep ecology as a commitment to ecosophy T Næsss personal beliefs The T referred to Tvergastein a mountain hut where he wrote many of his books and reflected Næsss view that everyone should develop his own philosophy Although a very rich and complex philosophy Næsss ecosophy can be summed up as having Selfrealization as its core According to Næss every being whether human animal or vegetable has an equal right to live and to blossom Through this capitalized Self Næss emphasizes in distinction to realization of man’s narrow selves the realization of our selves as part of an ecospheric whole It is in this whole that our true ecological Self can be realized Practically Selfrealization for Næss means that if one does not know how the outcomes of ones actions will affect other beings one should not act similar to the liberal harm principle Family Næss father Ragnar Næss was a successful banker and Næss was the younger brother of shipowner Erling Dekke Næss Næss himself was a married father of two and was the uncle of mountaineer and businessman Arne Næss Jr 1937–2004 who was once married to Diana Ross Works Harold Glasser ed ed 2005 The Selected Works of
