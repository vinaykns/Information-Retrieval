 A negative carbon dioxide emission or negative emission or a process that is carbon negative gives a permanent removal of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from Earths atmosphere It is considered the direct opposite of carbon dioxide emission hence its name It is the result of carbon dioxide removal technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage biochar direct air capture or enhanced weathering Negative emissions is different from reducing emissions as the former produces an outlet of carbon dioxide from Earths atmosphere whereas the latter decreases the inlet of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere Both have the same momentary net effect but for achieving carbon dioxide concentration levels below present levels such as 350 ppm negative emissions are critical Also for meeting higher concentration levels negative emissions are increasingly considered to be crucial as they provide the only possibility to fill the gap between needed reductions to meet mitigation targets and global emission trends In the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 released at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference the authors commented on the need for negative emissions stating Achieving lower concentration targets 450 ppm depends significantly on the use of BECCS Carbon dioxide sinks and negative carbon dioxide emissions A carbon dioxide sink such as a concentrated group of plants or any other primary producer that binds carbon dioxide into biomass such as within forests and kelp beds is not carbon negative as sinks are not permanent A carbon dioxide sink of this type moves carbon in the form of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or hydrosphere to the biosphere This process could be undone for example by wildfires or logging Carbon dioxide sinks that store carbon dioxide in the Earths crust by injecting it into the subsurface or in the form of insoluble carbonate salts mineral sequestration are considered carbon negative This is because they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration thousands to millions of years However Carbon Capture technology remains at best theoretical and is yet to reach more than 33 efficiency Furthermore this process could be rapidly undone for example by earthquakes or mining See also Sustainable development portal Biochar Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage Carbon capture and storage Carbon dioxide air capture Carbon dioxide removal Carbon dioxide scrubber Carbonneutral fuel Climate change mitigation scenarios Climate engineering geoengineering Greenhouse gas remediation List of emerging technologies Lowcarbon economy Virgin Earth Challenge External links Wald Matthew L 20080326 For Carbon Emissions a Goal of Less Than Zero New York Times The New York Times Company Retrieved 20080515Â  Bellona Brief a carbon negative solution Biorecro on carbon negativity through BECCS BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage References
