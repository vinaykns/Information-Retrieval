the Butler Brothers His primary focus was on selling products at low prices to get highervolume sales at a lower profit margin portraying it as a crusade for the consumer He experienced setbacks because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high but he was able to find lowercost suppliers than those used by other stores He passed on the savings in the product pricing Sales increased 45 percent in his first year of ownership to US105000 in revenue which increased to US140000 the next year and US175000 the year after that Within the fifth year the store was generating US250000 in revenue When the lease for the location expired Walton was unable to reach an agreement for renewal so he opened up a new store at 105 N Main Street in Bentonville naming it Waltons Five and Dime That store is now the Walmart Museum On July 2 1962 Walton opened the first Walmart Discount City store at 719 W Walnut Street in Rogers Arkansas The building is now occupied by a hardware store and an antique mall while the companys Store 1‍—‌since relocated to a larger discount store and now expanded to a Supercenter‍—‌is located several blocks west at 2110 W Walnut Street Within its

marked the completion of the companys satellite network a US24 million investment linking all operating units with the Bentonville office via twoway voice and data transmission and oneway video

States and 2800 elsewhere employing more than 16 million associates Its US presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained more than 60 miles 97 kilometres from the nearest store As Walmart rapidly expanded into the worlds largest corporation many critics worried about its effect on local communities particularly small towns with many mom and pop stores There have been several studies on the economic impact of Walmart on small towns and local businesses jobs and taxpayers In one Kenneth Stone a Professor of Economics at Iowa State University found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening However in another study he compared the changes to what small town shops had faced in the past – including the development of the railroads the advent of the Sears Roebuck catalog as well as the arrival of shopping malls – and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after Walmart arrives A later study in collaboration with Mississippi State University showed that there are both positive and negative impacts on existing stores in the area where the new supercenter locates In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005 Walmart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the disaster donating US20 million in cash 1500 truckloads of merchandise food for 100000 meals as well as the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers An independent study by Steven Horwitz of St Lawrence University found that Walmart The Home Depot and Lowes made use of their local knowledge about supply chains infrastructure decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before FEMA began its response While the company was overall lauded for its quick response – amidst criticism of the Federal Emergency Management Agency – several critics were nonetheless quick to point out that there still remained issues with the companys labor relations 2005–2010 Initiatives In October 2005 Walmart announced several environmental measures to increase energy efficiency The primary goals included spending US500 million a year to increase fuel efficiency in Walmarts truck fleet by 25 percent over three years and double it within ten reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in seven years reduce energy use at stores by 30 percent and cut solid waste from US stores and Sams Clubs by 25 percent in three years CEO Lee Scott said that Walmarts goal was to be a good steward for the environment and ultimately use only renewable energy sources and produce zero waste The company also designed three new experimental stores with wind turbines photovoltaic solar panels biofuelcapable boilers watercooled refrigerators and xeriscape gardens Despite much criticism of its environmental record Walmart took a few steps in what some viewed as a positive direction which included becoming the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world as well as reducing packaging and energy costs Walmart also spent nearly a year working with outside consultants to discover the companys total environmental impact and find areas for improvement Walmart has also recently created its own electric company in Texas Texas Retail Energy and plans to supply its

percent from the 2004 savings estimate of US2329 On June 30 2008 Walmart removed the hyphen from its logo and replaced the star with a Spark symbol that resembles a sunburst flower or star The new logo received mixed reviews from design critics who questioned whether the new logo was as bold as those of competitors such as the Target bullseye or as instantly recognizable as the previous company logo which was used for 18 years The new logo made its debut on the companys website on July 1 2008 Walmarts US locations were to update store logos in the fall of 2008 as part of an ongoing evolution

its stake to 51 percent in Chinese online supermarket Yihaodian to tap rising consumer wealth and help the company offer more products Walmart took full ownership in July 2015 In November 2006 the company announced a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises to operate in India As foreign corporations were not allowed to enter the retail sector directly Walmart operated through franchises and handled the wholesale end of the business The partnership involves two joint ventures – Bharti manages the front end involving opening of retail outlets while Walmart takes care of the back end such as cold chains and logistics Walmart operates stores in India under the name Best Price Modern Wholesale The first store opened in Amritsar on 30 May 2009 On September 14 2012 the Government of India

company would be able to start opening Walmart stores in India within two years Expansion into India faced some significant problems In November 2012 Walmart admitted to spending US25 million lobbying the Indian National Congress‍—‌lobbying is conventionally considered bribery in India Walmart is conducting an internal investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Bharti Walmart suspended a number of employees rumored to include its CFO and legal team to ensure a complete and thorough investigation As of January 31 2017 there are 20 Best Price locations In October 2013 Bharti and Walmart separated to pursue businesses independently Setbacks In the mid1990s Walmart tried with a large financial investment to get a foothold in the German retail market In 1997 Walmart took over the supermarket chain Wertkauf with its 21 stores for DEM750 million and in 1998 Walmart acquired 74 Interspar stores for DEM13 billion The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among companies which used a similar low price strategy as Walmart As a result Walmarts low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage Also Walmarts corporate culture was not viewed positively among employees and customers particularly Walmarts statement of ethics which restricted relationships between employees and led to a public discussion in the media resulting in a bad reputation among customers In July 2006 Walmart announced its withdrawal from Germany due to sustained losses The stores were sold to the German company Metro during Walmarts fiscal third quarter Walmart did not disclose its losses from its German investment but they were estimated to be around €3 billion Corruption charges An April 2012 investigative report by The New York Times reported the allegations of a former executive of Walmart de Mexico that in September 2005 the company had paid bribes via local fixers to officials throughout Mexico in exchange for construction permits information and other favors which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over competitors Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken Concerns were also raised that Walmart executives in the United States had hushed up the allegations A followup investigation by The New York Times published December 17 2012 revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting construction and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery There was evidence that a bribe of US52000 was paid to change a zoning map which enabled the opening of a Walmart store a mile from a historical site in San Juan Teotihuacán in 2004 After the initial article was released Walmart released a statement denying the allegations and describing its anticorruption policy While an official Walmart report states that it had found no evidence of corruption the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public Forbes contributor Adam Hartung also commented that the bribery scandal was a reflection of Walmarts serious management and strategy troubles stating scandals are now commonplace  each scandal points out that Walmarts strategy is harder to navigate and is running into big problems As of December 2012 internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Walmart has invested US99 million on internal investigations which expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China Brazil and India The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by foreign financial and corporate interests Sams Club Main article Sams Club Sams Club is a chain of warehouse clubs that sell groceries and general merchandise often in bulk They range from 71000 to 168000 square feet 6600 to 15600

Small Business Their slogan has been Savings Made Simple since late 2009 as Sams Club attempts to attract a more diverse member base In March 2009 the company announced that it plans to enter the electronic medical records business by offering a software package to physicians in small practices for US25000 Walmart is partnering with Dell and eClinicalWorkscom in this new venture Sams Clubs sales were US56828 billion or 119 percent of total Walmart sales during fiscal 2016 As of January 31 2017 there were 660 Sams Clubs in 47 states and Puerto Rico Oregon Rhode Island which that states only location closed in 2016 Vermont and the District of Columbia are the only states and territories where a Sams Club does not operate Walmart through Walmart International also operates

Walmart Sams Club ASDA and all other international brands There are several locations in the United States located in California and Oregon They are San Bruno Sunnyvale Brisbane and Portland Locations outside of the United States include Shanghai China Leeds United Kingdom and Bangalore India Subsidiaries Vudu In February 2010 Walmart agreed to buy Vudu a Silicon Valley startup whose online movie service is being built into an increasing number of televisions and Bluray players Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed but a person briefed on the deal said the price for the company which raised US60 million in capital was over US100 million It is the third most popular online movie service with a market share of 53 percent Private label brands Main article List of Walmart brands About 40 percent of products sold in Walmart are private label store brands which are produced for the company through contracts with manufacturers Walmart began offering private label brands in 1991 with the launch of Sams Choice a line of drinks produced by Cott Beverages for Walmart Sams Choice quickly became popular and by 1993 was the third most popular beverage brand in the United States Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the US and Canada and Smart Price in Britain A 2006 study talked of the magnitude of mindshare Walmart appears to hold in the shoppers minds when it comes to the awareness of private label brands and retailers Entertainment In 2010 the company teamed with Procter Gamble to produce Secrets of the Mountain and The Jensen Project twohour family movies which featured the characters using Walmart and Procter Gamble branded products The Jensen Project also featured a preview of a product to be released in several months in Walmart stores A third movie A Walk in My Shoes also aired in 2010 and a fourth is in production Walmarts director of brand marketing also serves as cochair of the Association of National Advertiserss Alliance for Family Entertainment Moosejaw On February 15 2017 Walmart acquired Moosejaw an online active outdoor retailer for approximately 51 million Moosejaw brought with it more than 400 brands including Patagonia The North Face Marmot and Arc’teryx Corporate affairs Walmart is headquartered in the Walmart Home Office complex in Bentonville Arkansas The companys business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices Doug McMillon became Walmarts CEO on February 1 2014 McMillon began his Walmart career in warehouses while in high school He has also worked as the head of Sams Club and Walmart International The company refers to employees as associates All Walmart stores in the US and Canada also have designated greeters at the entrance a practice pioneered by Sam Walton and later imitated by other retailers Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions For many years associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest but this practice was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with khaki pants and polo shirts The wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul to increase sales and rejuvenate the companys stock price In September 2014 the uniform was again updated to bring back a vest paid for by the company for store employees over the same polos and khaki or black pants paid for by the employee The vest is navy blue for Walmart employees at Supercenters and discount stores and lime green for Walmart Neighborhood Market employees both state Proud Walmart Associate on the left breast and the Spark logo covering the back Reportedly one of the main reasons the vest was reintroduced was because some customers had trouble identifying employees By requiring employees to wear uniforms that are made up of standard street wear Walmart is not required to purchase or reimbursement employees which is required in some states as long as that clothing can be worn elsewhere Businesses are only legally required to pay for branded shirts and pants or clothes that would be difficult to wear outside of work Unlike many other retailers Walmart does not charge slotting fees to suppliers for their products to appear in the store Instead it focuses on selling more popular products and provides incentives for store managers to drop unpopular products On September 14 2006 the company announced that it would phase out its layaway program citing declining use and increased costs Layaway ceased on November 19 2006 and required merchandise pickup by December 8 2006 Walmart now focuses on other payment options such as increased use of six and twelvemonth zerointerest financing The layaway location in most stores is now used for Walmarts SiteToStore program which was introduced in March 2007 This enables walmartcom customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup Finance and governance For the fiscal year ending January 31 2015 Walmart reported net income of US17 billion on US4857 billion of revenue The companys international operations accounted for US1977 billion or 407 percent of sales Walmart

primary competitors include department stores like Aldi Kmart Kroger Ingles Publix Target Shopko and Meijer and Winn Dixie Canadas The Real Canadian Superstore and Giant Tiger and Mexicos Comercial Mexicana and Soriana Competitors of Walmarts Sams Club division are Costco and the smaller BJs Wholesale Club chain Walmarts move into the grocery business in the late 1990s also set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada Some retail analysts see regional grocery store chain WinCo Foods as serious competition for Walmart Several smaller retailers primarily dollar stores such as Family Dollar and Dollar General have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Walmart In 2004 Walmart responded by testing its own dollar store concept a subsection of some stores called PenniesnCents Walmart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets For example in Germany it had captured just 2 percent of the German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained a secondary player behind Aldi with 19 percent Walmart continues to do well in the UK where its Asda subsidiary is the second largest retailer In May 2006 after entering the South Korean market in 1998 Walmart sold all 16 of its South Korean outlets to Shinsegae a local retailer for US882 million Shinsegae rebranded the Walmarts as Emart stores Walmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas In China Walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens For example it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks leading to higher sales Customer base Walmart customers cite low prices as the most important reason for shopping there The average US Walmart customers income is below the national average and analysts estimated that more than onefifth of them lack a bank account twice the national rate A 2006 Walmart report also indicated that Walmart customers are sensitive to higher utility costs and gas prices A poll indicated that after the 2004 US Presidential Election 76 percent of voters who shopped at Walmart once a week voted for George W Bush while only 23 percent supported senator John Kerry When measured against similar retailers in the US frequent Walmart shoppers were rated the most politically conservative Thus as of 2014 the majority 54 percent of Americans who prefer shopping at Walmart report that they oppose samesex marriage while 40 percent are in favor of it Due to its prominence in the Bible Belt Walmart is known for its tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers Walmart only carries clean versions of hiphop audio CDs and in cooperation with The Timothy Plan places plastic sheathes over suggestive womens periodicals and banned lad mags such as Maxim magazine In addition Walmart also caters to its Christian customer base by selling Christian books and media such as VeggieTales videos and The PurposeDriven Life which earns the company over US1 billion annually In 2006 Walmart took steps to expand its US customer base announcing a modification in its US stores from a onesizefitsall merchandising strategy to one designed to reflect each of six demographic groups – AfricanAmericans the affluent emptynesters Hispanics suburbanites and rural residents Around six months later it unveiled a new slogan Saving people money so they can live better lives This reflects the three main groups into which Walmart categorizes its 200 million customers brand aspirationals people with low incomes who are obsessed with names like KitchenAid pricesensitive affluents wealthier shoppers who love deals and valueprice shoppers people who like low prices and cannot afford much more Walmart has also made steps to appeal to more liberal customers for example by rejecting the American Family Associations recommendations and carrying the DVD Brokeback Mountain a love story between two gay cowboys in Wyoming Technology Open Source Software Many Walmart technology projects are coded in the open and available through the Walmart Labs GitHub repository as Open Source software under the OSI approved Apache V20 license At the time of writing November 2016 141 public Github projects are listed During a migration of the walmartcom retail platform to Facebook React and Nodejs the Electrode project was created to power the ecommerce platform which serves 80 million visitors per month and 15 million items Electrode provides various developer enhancements and tools for the developer including Nodejs configuration and feature management Alex Grigoryan of Walmart Labs released a statement on Mediumcom 3 October 2016 explaining the details of the applications and the scale that they operate at Walmart Big data analytics As the largest retailer in the US Walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data The big data sets are mined for use in predictive analytics which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customers habits Walmarts datacenter is unofficially referred to as Area 71 In April 2011 Walmart acquired Kosmix to develop software for analyzing realtime data streams In August 2012 Walmart announced its Polaris search engine The amount of data gathered by Walmart has raised privacy concerns Charity Sam Walton believed that the companys contribution to society was the fact that it operated efficiently thereby lowering the cost of living for customers and therefore in that sense was a powerful force for good despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes Having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a handout he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education they could not be expected to solve every personal problem that comes to their attention He explained later in his autobiography We feel very strongly that WalMart really is not and should not be in the charity business stating any debit has to be passed along to somebody‍—‌either shareholders or our customers Since Sam Waltons death in 1992 however Walmart and the Walmart Foundation dramatically increased charitable giving For example in 2005 Walmart donated US20 million in cash and merchandise for Hurricane Katrina relief Today Walmarts charitable donations approach US1 billion each year Economic impact Kenneth Stone Professor of Economics at Iowa State University in a paper published in Farm Foundation in 1997 found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening He compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past‍—‌from the development of the railroads and the Sears Roebuck catalog to shopping malls He concludes that small towns are more affected by discount mass merchandiser stores than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the everchanging retail market can coexist and even thrive in this type of environment One study found Walmarts entry into a new market has a profound impact on its competition When a Walmart opens in a new market median sales drop 40 percent at similar highvolume stores 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores according to a June 2009 study by researchers at several universities and led by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College A Loyola University Chicago study suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store The leader of that study admits that this factor is stronger in smaller towns and doesnt apply to more urban areas saying Itd be so tough to nail down whats up with WalMart These findings are underscored by another study conducted in 2009 by the National Bureau of Economics that showed large negative effects for competing businesses within five to ten miles of the new opening big box retailer This same study also found that the local retailers experience virtually no benefit This particularly contrasts with studies that find that local firms reinvest nearly 63 more of profits in other local businesses compared to chain retailers as found by the Maine Center of Economic Policy in 2011 Walmart has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals including labor unions community groups grassroots organizations religious organizations environmental groups and the companys own customers and employees They have protested against the companys policies and business practices including charges of racial and gender discrimination Other areas of criticism include the companys foreign product sourcing treatment of suppliers employee compensation and working conditions environmental practices the use of public subsidies the companys security policies and slavery Walmart denies doing anything wrong and maintains that low prices are the result of efficiency A 2001 McKinsey Global Institute study of US labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 concluded that WalMart directly and indirectly caused the bulk of the productivity acceleration in the retail sector Robert Solow a Nobel laureate in economics and an adviser to the study stated that by far the most important factor in that growth is WalMart The Economic Policy Institute estimates that between 2001 and 2006 WalMarts trade deficit with China alone eliminated nearly 200000 US jobs Another study at the University of Missouri found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by 100 jobs in the short term half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close A 2004 paper by two professors at Pennsylvania State University found that US counties with Walmart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without WalMarts They hypothesized that this could be due to the displacement of workers from higherpaid jobs in the retailers customers no longer choose to patronize WalMart providing less local charity than the replaced businesses or a shrinking pool of local leadership and reduced social capital due to a reduced number of local independent businesses Dr Raj Patel author of Stuffed and Starved Markets Power and the Hidden Battle for the World Food System said in a lecture at the University of Melbourne on September 18 2007 that a study in Nebraska looked at two different WalMarts the first of which had just arrived and was in the process of driving everyone else out of business but to do that they cut their prices to the bone very very low prices In the other WalMart they had successfully destroyed the local economy there was a sort of economic crater with WalMart in the middle and in that community the prices were 17  percent higher A 2005 story in The Washington Post reported that WalMarts discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of American shoppers by at least US50 billion per year A study in 2005 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT measured the effect on consumer welfare and found that the poorest segment of the population benefits the most from the existence of discount retailers A June 2006 article published by the libertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute suggested that WalMart has a positive impact on small business It argued that while WalMarts low prices caused some existing businesses to close the chain also created new opportunities for other small business and so the process of creative destruction unleashed by WalMart has no statistically significant impact on the overall size of the small business sector in the United States In 2006 American newspaper columnist George Will named WalMart the most prodigious jobcreator in the history of the private sector in this galaxy and that by lowering consumer prices WalMart costs about 50 retail jobs among competitors for every 100 jobs WalMart creates In terms of economic effects Will states that WalMart and its effects save shoppers more than US200 billion a year dwarfing such government programs as food stamps US286 billion and the earned income tax credit US346 billion A 2014 story in The Guardian reported that the WalMart Foundation was boosting its efforts to work with US manufacturers In February 2014 the Walmart Foundation pledged US10 billion to support domestic manufacturers and announced plans to buy US250 billion worth of Americanmade products in the next decade Labor relations With over 22 million employees worldwide Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce These issues involve low wages poor working conditions inadequate health care as well as issues involving the companys strong antiunion policies In November 2013 the National Labor Relations Board NLRB announced that it had found that in 13 US states WalMart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes Critics point to Walmarts high turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce although other factors may be involved Approximately 70 percent of its employees leave within the first year Despite this turnover rate the company is still able to affect unemployment rates This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socioeconomic variables were taken into account Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States employing almost five times as many people as IBM the second largest employer Walmart employs more African Americans than any other private employer in the United States On February 23 2015 Walmart announced that it is bumping its minimum wage to US10 an hour by February 2016 Gender and sexual orientation In 2007 a gender discrimination lawsuit Dukes v WalMart Stores Inc was filed against Walmart alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions A class action suit was sought which would have been the nations largest in history covering 15 million past and current employees On June 20 2011 the United States Supreme Court ruled in WalMarts favor stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class The court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs circumstances the class action could not proceed as presented and furthermore in a 5–4 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit Several plaintiffs including the lead plaintiff Betty Dukes expressed their intent to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately According to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit in 2001 WalMarts EEOC filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of WalMarts hourly paid workforce but only 33 percent of its management Just 35 percent of its store managers were women compared to 57 percent at similar retailers WalMart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair because it classifies employees differently if department managers were included in the totals women would make up 60 percent of the managerial ranks Others have criticized the lawsuit as without basis in the law and as an abuse of the class action mechanism In 2007 WalMart was named by the National Association for Female Executives as one of the top 35 companies for Executive Women WalMarts rating on the Human Rights Campaigns Corporate Equality Index a measure of how companies treat LGBT employees and customers has increased greatly during the past decade The company was praised for expanding its antidiscrimination policy protecting gay and lesbian employees as well as for a new definition of family that included samesex partners However they have been criticized by the HRC in other areas such as not renewing its membership in the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce In January 2006 WalMart announced that diversity efforts include new groups of minority female and gay employees that meet at WalMart headquarters in Bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion There are seven Business Resource Groups women AfricanAmericans Hispanics Asians Native Americans Gays and Lesbians and a disabled group Animal welfare In April 2016 Walmart announced that it plans to eliminate eggs from battery cages from its supply chain by 2025 The decision was particularly important because of Walmarts large market share and influence on the rest of the industry The move was praised by major animal welfare groups and heralded as an end of an era by HSUS president Wayne Pacelle but a poultry trade group representative expressed skepticism about the decisions impact Walmarts cagefree eggs will not come from free range producers but rather industrialscale farms where the birds will be allotted between 1 and 15 square feet each a stressful arrangement which can cause cannibalism Unlike battery cages the systems Walmarts suppliers will use allow the hens to move around but relative to battery cages they have higher hen mortality rates and present distinct environmental and worker health problems See also
