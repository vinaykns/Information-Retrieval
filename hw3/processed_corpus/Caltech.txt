 The California Institute of Technology abbreviated Caltech is a private doctorategranting university located in Pasadena California United States Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G Throop in 1891 the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale Arthur Amos Noyes and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1921 In 1934 Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities and the antecedents of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory which Caltech continues to manage and operate were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering managing 332 million in 2011 in sponsored research Its 124acre 50 ha primary campus is located approximately 11 mi 18 km northeast of downtown Los Angeles Firstyear students are required to live on campus and 95 of undergraduates remain in the oncampus House System at Caltech Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign takehome examinations The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division IIIs Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Caltech is frequently cited as one of the worlds best universities Caltech alumni and faculty include 34 Nobel Prizes Linus Pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes 1 Fields Medalist 6 Turing Award winners 4 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force and 71 have won the United States National Medal of Science or Technology There are 112 faculty members who have been elected to the United States National Academies In addition numerous faculty members are associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as NASA According to a 2015 Pomona College study Caltech ranked number one in the US for the percentage of its graduates who go on to earn a PhD History Throop College Caltech started as a vocational school founded in Pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician Amos G Throop The school was known successively as Throop University Throop Polytechnic Institute and Manual Training School and Throop College of Technology before acquiring its current name in 1920 The vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form an independent Polytechnic School in 1907 At a time when scientific research in the United States was still in its infancy George Ellery Hale a solar astronomer from the University of Chicago founded the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1904 He joined Throops board of trustees in 1907 and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination He engineered the appointment of James A B Scherer a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser to Throops presidency in 1908 Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W Gates to donate 25000 in seed money to build Gates Laboratory the first science building on campus World Wars In 1910 Throop moved to its current site Arther Fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site Theodore Roosevelt delivered an address at Throop Institute on March 21 1911 and he declared I want to see institutions like Throop turn out perhaps ninetynine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them I want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the Panama Canal and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country—and the onehundredth man I want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer George Ellery Hale In the same year a bill was introduced in the California Legislature calling for the establishment of a publicly funded California Institute of Technology with an initial budget of a million dollars ten times the budget of Throop at the time The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state but the presidents of Stanford University and the University of California successfully lobbied to defeat the bill which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific researchoriented education institute in southern California public or private until the onset of the World War II necessitated the broader development of researchbased science education The promise of Throop attracted physical chemist Arthur Amos Noyes from MIT to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology With the onset of World War I Hale organized the National Research Council to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at landgrant colleges and instead sought to raise a 1 million national research fund entirely from private sources To that end as Hale wrote in The New York Times Throop College of Technology in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure cooperation and advance scientific investigation This institution with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation President Scherer hearing of the formation of the council immediately offered to take part in its work and with this object he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars Through the National Research Council Hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs and for Throop to play a national role in science The new funds were designated for physics research and ultimately led to the establishment of the Norman Bridge Laboratory which attracted experimental physicist Robert Andrews Millikan from the University of Chicago in 1917 During the course of the war Hale Noyes and Millikan worked together in Washington on the NRC Subsequently they continued their partnership in developing Caltech Under the leadership of Hale Noyes and Millikan aided by the booming economy of Southern California Caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s and concentrated on the development of Roosevelts Hundredth Man On November 29 1921 the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics physics and chemistry broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English history and economics and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research In 1923 Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics In 1925 the school established a department of geology and hired William Bennett Munro then chairman of the division of History Government and Economics at Harvard University to create a division of humanities and social sciences at Caltech In 1928 a division of biology was established under the leadership of Thomas Hunt Morgan the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time and discoverer of the role of genes and the chromosome in heredity In 1930 Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie In 1926 a graduate school of aeronautics was created which eventually attracted Theodore von Kármán Kármán later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the worlds centers for rocket science In 1928 construction of the Palomar Observatory began Millikan served as Chairman of the Executive Council effectively Caltechs president from 1921 to 1945 and his influence was such that the Institute was occasionally referred to as Millikans School Millikan initiated a visitingscholars program soon after joining Caltech Scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as Paul Dirac Erwin Schrödinger Werner Heisenberg Hendrik Lorentz and Niels Bohr Albert Einstein arrived on the Caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his Theory of General Relativity and he returned to Caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933 During World War II Caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission The United States Navy also maintained a naval training school for aeronautical engineering resident inspectors of ordnance and naval material and a liaison officer to the National Defense Research Committee on campus Postwar growth In the 1950s–1970s Caltech was the home of Murray GellMann and Richard Feynman whose work was central to the establishment of the Standard Model of particle physics Feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful unconventional character During Lee A DuBridges tenure as Caltechs president 1946–1969 Caltechs faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size DuBridge unlike his predecessors welcomed federal funding of science New research fields flourished including chemical biology planetary science nuclear astrophysics and geochemistry A 200inch telescope was dedicated on nearby Palomar Mountain in 1948 and remained the worlds most powerful optical telescope for over forty years Caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of Harold Brown in 1970 and they made up 14 of the entering class The fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then Caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politics that there has been only one organized student protest in January 1968 outside the Burbank studios of NBC in response to rumors that NBC was to cancel Star Trek In 1973 the students from Dabney House protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase Impeach Nixon The following week Ross McCollum president of the National Oil Company wrote an open letter to Dabney House stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to Caltech The Dabney family being Republicans disowned Dabney House after hearing of the prank 21st century Since 2000 the Einstein Papers Project has been located at Caltech The project was established in 1986 to assemble preserve translate and publish papers selected from the literary estate of Albert Einstein and from other collections In fall 2008 the freshman class was 42 female a record for Caltechs undergraduate enrollment In the same year the Institute concluded a sixyearlong fundraising campaign The campaign raised more than 14 billion from about 16000 donors Nearly half of the funds went into the support of Caltech programs and projects In 2010 Caltech in partnership with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and headed by Professor Nathan Lewis established a DOE Energy Innovation Hub aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight This hub the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis will receive up to 122 million in federal funding over five years Since 2012 Caltech began to offer classes through massive open online courses MOOCs under Coursera and from 2013 edX JeanLou Chameau the eighth president announced on February 19 2013 that he would be stepping down to accept the presidency at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology Thomas F Rosenbaum was announced to be the ninth president of Caltech on October 24 2013 and his term began on July 1 2014 Campus See also List of California Institute of Technology buildings and facilities Caltechs 124acre 50 ha primary campus is located in Pasadena California approximately 11 miles 18 km northeast of downtown Los Angeles It is within walking distance of Old Town Pasadena and the Pasadena Playhouse District and therefore the two locations are frequent getaways for Caltech students In 1917 Hale hired architect Bertram Goodhue to produce a master plan for the 22 acres 89 ha campus Goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building Dabney Hall and several other structures in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate the character of the school and Hales educational philosophy Goodhues designs for Caltech were also influenced by the traditional Spanish mission architecture of Southern California In 1971 a magnitude66 earthquake in San Fernando caused some damage to the Caltech campus Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhuedesigned Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked These were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings and their plans did not contain enough details such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete to be sure they were safe so the engineers recommended demolition However demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse A large wrecking ball was used to demolish Throop Hall and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar far in excess of safety requirements The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away and the process took much longer than expected New additions to the campus include the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology which opened in 2009 and the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering followed in March 2010 The Institute also concluded an upgrading of the south houses in 2006 In late 2010 Caltech completed a 13 MW solar array projected to produce approximately 16 GWh in 2011 Organization and administration See also List of California Institute of Technology trustees The mission statement of Caltech reads

its 2014 Best Colleges ranking US News World Report ranked Caltech as tied for the 10th best university in the United States in their 2016 national rankings with the graduate programs in chemistry and earth sciences ranked first in the nation The United States National Research Council released its latest Assessment of Research Doctorate Programs in 2010 and 23 of the 24 graduate programs of Caltech were ranked within the top four programs in the nation in their size quartile as determined by both the R95 and S95 rankings Of particular note programs that were placed within the top 10 of all size programs in that field based on an average of the R95 and S95 rank order include Aeronautics Astrophysics Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics Bioengineering Biology Chemical Engineering Chemistry Electrical Engineering Environmental Science and Engineering Geology Geophysics Materials Science Mechanical Engineering Physics Planetary Science and Social Science Economics In 2013 a paper published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics ranked Caltech 2nd in the US after Harvard for revealed preference The sample of the study was 3240 high achieving students students ranked in the top 10 of public high school class or top 20 of private high school class Rankings were based on number of students who accepted offered admission Admissions For the Class of 2019 enrolled fall 2015 Caltech received 6506 applications and accepted 573 88 241 enrolled a yield rate the percentage of accepted students who enroll of 421 The middle 50 range of SAT scores for enrolled freshmen were 730800 for critical reading 770800 for math and 730790 for writing The middle 50 range ACT Composite score was 3435 Tuition and financial aid Undergraduate tuition for the 2013–2014 school year was 39990 and total annual costs were estimated to be 58755 In 2012–2013 Caltech awarded 171 million in needbased aid 438k in nonneedbased aid and 251 million in selfhelp support to enrolled undergraduate student The average financial aid package of all students eligible for aid was 38756 and students graduated with an average debt of 15090 Undergraduate program The fulltime fouryear undergraduate program emphasizes instruction in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence Caltech offers 24 majors called options and six minors across all six academic divisions Caltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in Applied Physics Biochemistry Bioengineering Computation and Neural Systems Control and Dynamical Systems Environmental Science and Engineering Geobiology and Astrobiology Geochemistry and Planetary Astronomy The most popular options are Chemical Engineering Computer Science Electrical Engineering Mechanical Engineering and Physics Prior to the entering class of 2017 Caltech requires students to take a core curriculum of three terms of mathematics three terms of physics two terms of chemistry one term of biology two terms of lab courses one terms of scientific communication three terms of physical education and 12 terms of humanities and social science A typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options degree requirements students need to take an average of 405 units per term more than four classes in order to graduate in four years 36 units is the minimum fulltime load 48 units is considered a heavy load and registrations above 54 units require an overload petition Approximately 20 percent of students doublemajor This is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major Although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged it is still possible Firstyear students are enrolled in firstterm classes based upon results of placement exams in math physics chemistry and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a PassFail basis There is little competition collaboration on homework is encouraged and the Honor System encourages takehome tests and flexible homework schedules Caltech offers cooperative programs with other schools such as the Pasadena Art Center College of Design and Occidental College Upon graduation Caltech alumni have one of the highest median starting salary among graduates of other colleges or universities in 2012–2013 of 67400 according to PayScale The midcareer median pay is 120700 Caltech was found to offer the second highest return of investment of college education at 1991000 over a 30year period according to the same study Caltech offers Army and Air Force ROTC in cooperation with the University of Southern California Graduate program The graduate instructional programs emphasize doctoral studies and are dominated by science technology engineering and mathematics fields The Institute offers graduate degree programs for the Master of Science Engineers Degree Doctor of Philosophy BSMS and MDPhD with the majority of students in the PhD program The most popular options are Chemistry Physics Biology Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering Applicants for graduate studies are required to take the GRE GRE Subject scores are either required or strongly recommended by several options A joint program between Caltech and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California and the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine grants MDPhD degrees Students in this program do their preclinical and clinical work at USC or UCLA and their PhD work with any member of the Caltech faculty including the Biology Chemistry and Engineering and Applied Sciences Divisions The MD degree would be from USC or UCLA and the PhD would be awarded from Caltech The research facilities at Caltech are available to graduate students but there are opportunities for students to work in facilities of other universities research centers as well as private industries The graduate student to faculty ratio is 41 Approximately 99 percent of doctoral students have full financial support Financial support for graduate students comes in the form of fellowships research assistantships teaching assistantships or a combination of fellowship and assistantship support Graduate students are bound by the Honor Code as are the undergraduates and the Graduate Honor Council oversees any violations of the code Research Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a research university with very high research activity primarily in STEM fields Caltech manages research expenditures of 270 million annually 66th among all universities in the US and 17th among private institutions without medical schools for 2008 The largest federal agencies contributing to research are NASA National Science Foundation Department of Health and Human Services Department of Defense and Department of Energy Caltech received 144 million in federal funding for the physical sciences 408 million for the life sciences 335 million for engineering 144 million for environmental sciences 716 million for computer sciences and 197 million for mathematical sciences in 2008 The Institute was awarded an alltime high funding of 357 million in 2009 Active funding from the National Science Foundation Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Science MPS for Caltech stands at 343 million as of 2011 the highest for any educational institution in the nation and higher than the total funds allocated to any state except California and New York In 2005 Caltech had 739000 square feet 68700 m dedicated to research 330000 square feet 30700 m to physical sciences 163000 square feet 15100 m to engineering and 160000 square feet 14900 m to biological sciences In addition to managing JPL

operates several TCCON stations as part of an international collaborative effort of measuring greenhouse gases globally One station is on campus Undergraduates at Caltech are also encouraged to participate in research About 80 of the class of 2010 did research through the annual Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships SURF program at least once during their stay and many continued during the school year Students write and submit SURF proposals for research projects in collaboration with professors and about 70 percent of applicants are awarded SURFs The program is open to both Caltech and nonCaltech undergraduate students It serves as preparation for graduate school and helps to explain why Caltech has the highest percentage of alumni who go on to receive a PhD of all the major universities The licensing and transferring of technology to the commercial sector is managed by the Office of Technology Transfer OTT OTT protects and manages the intellectual property developed by faculty members students other researchers and JPL technologists Caltech receives more invention disclosures per faculty member than any other university in the nation As of 2008 1891 patents were granted to Caltech researchers since 1969 Student life House system Main article House System at the California Institute of Technology During the early 20th century a Caltech committee visited several universities and decided to transform the undergraduate housing system from regular fraternities to a house system Four south houses or hovses were built Blacker House Dabney House Fleming House and Ricketts House In the 1960s three north houses were built Lloyd House Page House and Ruddock House and during the 1990s Avery House The four south houses closed for renovation in 2005 and reopened in 2006 All first year students live in the house system and 95 of undergraduates remain affiliated with a house Athletics Caltech has athletic teams in baseball mens and womens basketball cross country fencing mens soccer swimming and diving mens and womens tennis track and field womens volleyball and mens and womens water polo Caltechs mascot is the Beaver a homage to natures engineer Its teams with the exception of the fencing team play in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference which Caltech cofounded in 1915 The fencing team competes in the NCAAs Division I facing teams from UCLA USC UCSD and Stanford among others On January 6 2007 the Beavers mens basketball team snapped a 207game losing streak to Division III schools beating Bard College 81–52 It was their first Division III victory since 1996 Until their win over Occidental on February 22 2011 the team had not won a game in conference play since 1985 Ryan Elmquists free throw with 33 seconds in regulation gave the Beavers the victory The documentary film Quantum Hoops concerns the events of the Beavers 2005–06 season On January 13 2007 the Caltech womens basketball team snapped a 50game losing streak defeating the Pomona–Pitzer Sagehens 55–53 The womens program which entered the SCIAC in 2002 garnered their first conference win On the bench as honorary coach for the evening was Dr Robert Grubbs 2005 Nobel laureate in Chemistry The team went on to beat Whittier College on February 10 for its second SCIAC win and placed its first member on the All Conference team The 2006–2007 season is the most successful season in the history of the program In 2007 2008 and 2009 the womens table tennis team a club team competed in nationals The womens Ultimate club team known as Snatch has also been very successful in recent years ranking 44 of over 200 college teams in the Ultimate Players Association On February 2 2013 the Caltech baseball team ended a 228game losing streak the teams first win in nearly 10 years The track and field team plays at the South Athletic Field in Tournament Park the site of the first Rose Bowl Game The school also sponsored a football team prior to 1976 which played part of its home schedule at the Rose Bowl or as Caltech students put it to the largest number of empty seats in the nation Performing and visual arts The CaltechOccidental College Orchestra is a full seventypiece orchestra composed of students faculty and staff at Caltech and nearby Occidental College The orchestra gives three pairs of concerts annually at both Caltech and Occidental College There are also two Caltech Jazz Bands and a Concert Band For vocal music Caltech has a mixed voice Glee Club and a smaller Chamber Singer group The theater program at Caltech is known as TACIT or Theater Arts at the California Institute of Technology There are two to three plays organized by TACIT per year and they were involved in the production of the PHD Movie released in 2011 Student life traditions Annual events Every Halloween Dabney House conducts the infamous Millikan pumpkindrop experiment from the top of Millikan Library the highest point on campus According to tradition a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in liquid nitrogen and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a triboluminescent spark This yearly event involves a crowd of observers who try to spot the elusive spark The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous Millikan oildrop experiment which measured e the elemental unit of electrical charge On Ditch Day the seniors ditch school leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical electrical and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen Each group of seniors designs a stack to be solved by a handful of underclassmen The faculty have been drawn into the event as well and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year Another longstanding tradition is the playing of Wagners Ride of the Valkyries at 700 each morning during finals week with the largest loudest speakers available The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of The Ring Cycle and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed The playing of the Ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during Apollo 17 to awaken Astronaut Harrison Schmitt a Caltech alumnus Unfortunately the tradition arose at different times in different Houses so Schmitt did not react as expected Instead he just became confused Pranks Caltech students have been known for the many pranks also known as RFs The two most famous in recent history are the changing of the Hollywood Sign to read Caltech by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38 MIT 9 during the 1984 Rose Bowl Game But the most famous of all occurred during the 1961 Rose Bowl Game where Caltech students altered the flipcards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display Caltech and several other unintended messages This event is now referred to as the Great Rose Bowl Hoax In recent years pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion Caltechs Assistant VP for Student Affairs and Campus Life The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech and thats what we are trying to bring back reported the Boston Globe In December 2011 Caltech students went to New York and pulled a prank on Manhattans Greenwich Village The prank involved making The Cube sculpture look like the Aperture Science Weighted Companion Cube from the video game Portal Caltech pranks have been documented in three Legends of Caltech books the most recent of which was edited by alumni Autumn Looijen 99 and Mason A Porter 98 and published in May 2007 Rivalry with MIT Main article Caltech–MIT rivalry In 2005 a group of Caltech students pulled a string of pranks during MITs Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read That Other Institute of Technology A group of MIT hackers responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read The Only Institute of Technology Caltech students also passed out Tshirts to MITs incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and because not everyone can go to Caltech along with an image of a palm tree on the back MIT retaliated in April 2006 when students posing as the Howe Ser Howitzer Moving Company stole the 130yearold 17ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend repeating a similar prank performed by nearby Harvey Mudd College in 1986 Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10 2006 On April 13 2007 Friday the 13th a group of students from The California Tech Caltechs campus newspaper arrived and distributed fake copies of The Tech MITs campus newspaper while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend Articles included MIT Invents the Interweb Architects Deem Campus Unfortunate and Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite In December 2009 some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus A sold banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a Welcome to Caltech East School of the Humanities banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance Newspapers and Tshirts were distributed and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the curriculum change In September 2010 MIT students attempted to put a TARDIS the time machine from the BBCs Doctor Who onto a roof Caught in midact the prank was aborted In January 2011 Caltech students in conjunction with MIT students helped put the TARDIS on top of Baxter Caltech students then moved the TARDIS to UC Berkeley and Stanford In April 2014 during MITs Campus Preview Weekend a group of Caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the MIT logo on the front and the words The Institute of Technology on the back When heated the mugs turn orange display a palm tree and read Caltech The Hotter Institute of Technology Identical mugs continue to be sold at the Caltech campus store Honor code Life in the Caltech community is governed by the honor code which simply states No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community This is enforced by a Board of Control which consists of undergraduate students and by a similar body at the graduate level called the Graduate Honor Council The honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere For example the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as takehome allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment Through the late 1990s the only exception to the honor code implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations concerned the sexual harassment policy Today there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy and alcohol policy Though both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community People Main article List of California Institute of Technology people As of 2015 Caltech has 34 Nobel laureates to its name This figure includes 20 alumni 14 nonalumni professors and 4 professors who are also alumni Carl D Anderson Linus Pauling William A Fowler and Edward B Lewis The number of awards is 35 because Pauling received prizes in both Chemistry and Peace Seven faculty and alumni have

Stanislav Smirnov won the Fields Medal in 2010 Other distinguished researchers have been affiliated with Caltech as postdoctoral scholars for example Barbara McClintock James D Watson Sheldon Glashow and John Gurdon or visiting professors for example Albert Einstein Stephen Hawking and Edward Witten Students Caltech enrolled 979 undergraduate students and 1261 graduate students for the 2016–2017 school year Women made up 41 of the undergraduate and 29 of the graduate student body The fouryear graduation rate is 79 and the sixyear rate is 92 which is low compared to most leading US universities but substantially higher than it was in the 1960s and 1970s Students majoring in STEM fields traditionally have graduation rates below 70 Faculty and staff Richard Feynman was among the most wellknown physicists associated with Caltech having published the Feynman Lectures on Physics an undergraduate physics text and a few other popular science texts such as Six Easy Pieces for the general audience The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science although his Nobelwinning work in quantum electrodynamics was already very established in the scientific community Murray GellMann a Nobelwinning physicist introduced a classification of hadrons and went on to postulate the existence of quarks which is currently accepted as part of the Standard Model Longtime Caltech President Robert Andrews Millikan was the first to calculate the charge of the electron with his wellknown oildrop experiment while Richard Chace Tolman is remembered for his contributions to cosmology and statistical mechanics 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics winner H David Politzer is a current professor at Caltech as is astrophysicist and author Kip Thorne and eminent mathematician Barry Simon Linus Pauling pioneered quantum chemistry and molecular biology and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939 Seismologist Charles Richter also an alumnus developed the magnitude scale that bears his name the Richter magnitude scale for measuring the power of earthquakes One of the founders of the geochemistry department Clair Patterson was the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via leaduranium ratio in meteorites In engineering Theodore von Kármán made many key advances in aerodynamics notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization A repeating pattern of swirling vortices is named after him the von Kármán vortex street Participants in von Kármáns GALCIT project included Frank Malina who helped develop the WAC Corporal which was the first US rocket to reach the edge of space Jack Parsons a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable compositebased rocket motor and Qian Xuesen who was dubbed the Father of Chinese Rocketry More recently Michael Brown a professor of planetary astronomy discovered many transNeptunian objects most notably the dwarf planet Eris which prompted the International Astronomical Union to redefine the term planet David Baltimore the Robert A Millikan Professor of Biology and Alice Huang Senior Faculty Associate in Biology have served as the President of AAAS from 2007–2008 and 2010–2011 respectively 33 of the faculty are members of the National Academy of Science or Engineering andor fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences This is the highest percentage of any faculty in the country with the exception of the graduate institution Rockefeller University The average salary for assistant professors at Caltech is 111300 associate professors 121300 and full professors 172800 Caltech faculty are active in applied physics astronomy and astrophysics biology biochemistry biological engineering chemical engineering computer science geology mechanical engineering and physics Alumni There are 22930 total living alumni in the US and around the world 20 alumni and 14 nonalumni faculty have won the Nobel Prize The Turing Award the Nobel Prize of Computer Science has been awarded to six alumni and one has won the Fields Medal Alumni have participated in scientific research Some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules Nobel laureate Carl D Anderson BS 1927 PhD 1930 proved the existence of positrons and muons Nobel laureate Edwin McMillan BS 1928 MS 1929 synthesized the first transuranium element Nobel laureate Leo James Rainwater BS 1939 investigated the nonspherical shapes of atomic nuclei and Nobel laureate Douglas D Osheroff BS 1967 studied the superfluid nature of helium3 Donald Knuth PhD 1963 the father of the analysis of algorithms wrote The Art of Computer Programming and created the TeX computer typesetting system which is commonly used in the scientific community Narendra Karmarkar MS 1979 is known for the interior point method a polynomial algorithm for linear programming known as Karmarkars algorithm Other alumni have turned their gaze to the universe C Gordon Fullerton BS 1957 MS 1958 piloted the third space shuttle mission and orbited the earth in Skylab Astronaut and later United States Senator Harrison Schmitt BS 1957 was the only geologist to have ever walked on the surface of the moon Astronomer Eugene Merle Shoemaker BS 1947 MS 1948 codiscovered Comet ShoemakerLevy 9 a comet which crashed into the planet Jupiter and was the first person buried on the moon by having his ashes crashed into the moon Undergraduate alumni founded or cofounded companies such as LCD manufacturer Varitronix Hotmail Compaq and MathWorks which created Matlab while graduate students founded or cofounded companies such as Intel TRW and the nonprofit educational organization the Exploratorium Arnold Beckman PhD 1928 invented the pH meter and commercialized it with the founding of Beckman Instruments His success with that company enabled him to provide seed funding for William Shockley BS 1932 who had coinvented semiconductor transistors and wanted to commercialize them Shockley became the founding Director of the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments Shockley had previously worked at Bell Labs whose first president was another alumnus Frank Jewett BS 1898 Because his aging mother lived in Palo Alto California Shockley established his laboratory near her in Mountain View California Shockley was a corecipient of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 but his aggressive management style and odd personality at the Shockley Lab became unbearable In late 1957 eight of his researchers resigned and with support from Sherman Fairchild formed Fairchild Semiconductor Among the traitorous eight was Gordon E Moore PhD 1954 who later left Fairchild to cofound Intel Other offspring companies of Fairchild Semiconductor include National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices which in turn spawned more technology companies in the area Shockleys decision to use silicon – instead of germanium – as the semiconductor material coupled with the abundance of silicon semiconductor related companies in the area gave rise to the term Silicon Valley to describe that geographic region surrounding Palo Alto Caltech alumni also held public offices with Mustafa AG Abushagur PhD 1984 the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya James Fletcher PhD 1948 the 4th and 7th Administrator of NASA Steven Koonin PhD 1972
