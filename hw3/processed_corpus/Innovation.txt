 For other uses see Innovation disambiguation Innovation can be defined simply as a new idea device or method However innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements unarticulated needs or existing market needs This is accomplished through moreeffective products processes services technologies or business models that are readily available to markets governments and society The term innovation can be defined as something original and more effective and as a consequence new that breaks into the market or society It is related to but not the same as invention Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process The opposite of innovation is exnovation While a novel device is often described as an innovation in economics management science and other fields of practice and analysis innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society In industrial economics innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet the growing consumer demand Definition A 2013 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions In an industrial survey of how the software industry defined innovation the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete which builds on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD manuals definition Innovation is production or adoption assimilation and exploitation of a valueadded novelty in economic and social spheres renewal and enlargement of products services and markets development of new methods of production and establishment of new management systems It is both a process and an outcome Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of novelty patent ie whether an innovation is new to the firm new to the market new to the industry and new to the world and type of innovation whether it is process or productservice system innovation Interdisciplinary views Business and economics Main article innovation economics In business and economics innovation can be a catalyst to growth With rapid advancements in transportation and communications over the past few decades the old world concepts of factor endowments and comparative advantage which focused on an area’s unique inputs are outmoded for today’s global economy Economist Joseph Schumpeter who contributed greatly to the study of innovation economics argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products as well as market distribution such as the connection from the craft shop to factory He famously asserted that creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism In addition entrepreneurs continuously look for better ways to satisfy their consumer base with improved quality durability service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies One prime example was the explosive boom of Silicon Valley startups out of the Stanford Industrial Park In 1957 dissatisfied employees of Shockley Semiconductor the company of Nobel laureate and coinventor of the transistor William Shockley left to form an independent firm Fairchild Semiconductor After several years Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector Eventually these founders left to start their own companies based on their own unique latest ideas and then leading employees started their own firms Over the next 20 years this snowball process launched the momentous startup company explosion of information technology firms Essentially Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley’s eight former employees Since then hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar metonyms including Silicon Alley encompassing New York City Another example is the Business Incubators a phenomenon that is nurtured by governments around the world close to knowledge clusters mostly research based like universities or other Government Excellence Centres while the main goal is to channel the generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national economic growth Organizations In the organizational context innovation may be linked to positive changes in efficiency productivity quality competitiveness and market share However recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate in addition to employees core job tasks Peter Drucker wrote Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship whether in an existing business a public service institution or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealthproducing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth –Drucker According to Clayton Christensen disruptive innovation is the key to future success in business The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive Companies will have to downsize and reengineer their operations to remain competitive This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more While disruptive innovation will typically attack a traditional business model with a lowercost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly foundational innovation is slower and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term Foundational innovation tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly The advent of the packetswitched communication protocol TCPIP—originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication email and which gainded widespread adoption only in the mid1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web—is a foundational technology All organizations can innovate including for example hospitals universities and local governments For instance former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat a performancemeasurement data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of potholes This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money In its first year CitiStat saved the city 132 million Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to realtime tracking at bus stands In addition the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center automatically send data on location passenger counts engine performance mileage and other information This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems Still other innovative strategies include hospitals digitizing medical information in electronic medical records For example the US Department of Housing and Urban Developments HOPE VI initiatives turned severely distressed public housing in urban areas into revitalized mixedincome environments the Harlem Children’s Zone used a communitybased approach to educate local area children and the Environmental Protection Agencys brownfield grants facilitates turning over brownfields for environmental protection green spaces community and commercial development Sources There are several sources of innovation It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents by chance or as a result of a major system failure According to Peter F Drucker the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure in market structure in local and global demographics in human perception mood and meaning in the amount of already available scientific knowledge etc In the simplest linear model of innovation the traditionally recognized source is manufacturer innovation This is where an agent person or business innovates in order to sell the innovation Specifically RD measurement is the commonly used input for innovation in particular in the business sector named Business Expenditure on RD BERD that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining RD invested by the public sector Another source of innovation only now becoming widely recognized is enduser innovation This is where an agent person or company develops an innovation for their own personal or inhouse use because existing products do not meet their needs MIT economist Eric von Hippel has identified enduser innovation as by far the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject The Sources of Innovation The robotics engineer Joseph F Engelberger asserts that innovations require only three things A recognized need Competent people with relevant technology and Financial support However innovation processes usually involve identifying customer needs macro and meso trends developing competences and finding financial support The Kline chainlinked model of innovation places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing design manufacturing and RD Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways with much attention now given to formal research and development RD for breakthrough innovations RD help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry medicine engineering and government Yet innovations can be developed by less formal onthejob modifications of practice through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from RD while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends Information technology and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation For example the software tool company Atlassian conducts quarterly ShipIt Days in which employees may work on anything related to the companys products Google employees work on selfdirected projects for 20 of their time known as Innovation Time Off Both companies cite these bottomup processes as major sources for new products and features An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services As a result firms may incorporate users in focus groups user centred approach work closely with so called lead users lead user approach or users might adapt their products themselves The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations USTIR a project to innovate Europe’s surface transportation system employs such workshops Regarding this user innovation a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities In most of the times user innovators have some personal record motivating them Sometimes userinnovators may become entrepreneurs selling their product they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations or they may be adopted by their suppliers Nowadays they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations using methods like open source In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning Goals and failures Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives to the business plan and to market competitive positioning One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives As Davila et al 2006 notes Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive topline growth and for increasing bottomline results One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found ranked in decreasing order of popularity that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by Improved quality Creation of new markets Extension of the product range Reduced labor costs Improved production processes Reduced materials Reduced environmental damage Replacement of productsservices Reduced energy consumption Conformance to regulations These goals vary between improvements to products processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility marketing firm hospital or local government Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm Conversely failure can develop in programs of innovations The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types Poor goal definition Poor alignment of actions to goals Poor participation in teams Poor monitoring of results Poor communication and access to information Diffusion Main article Diffusion of innovations Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher Gabriel Tarde who first plotted the Sshaped diffusion curve Tarde defined the innovationdecision process as a series of steps that includes First knowledge Forming an attitude A decision to adopt or reject Implementation and use Confirmation of the decision Once innovation occurs innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the scurve or diffusion curve The scurve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time In the early stage of a particular innovation growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself At some point customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue Towards the end of its lifecycle growth slows and may even begin to decline In the later stages no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return The scurve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have product life – ie a startup phase a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline In fact the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve and never produce normal returns Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones Successive scurves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology The second shows an emerging technology that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth The length of life will depend on many factors Measures Edison et al in their review of literature on innovation management found 232 innovation metrics They categorized these measures along five dimensions ie inputs to the innovation process output from the innovation process effect of the innovation output measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process There are two different types of measures for innovation the organizational level and the political level Organizational level The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals teamlevel assessments and private companies from the smallest to the largest company Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys workshops consultants or internal benchmarking There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation Corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances innovation process efficiency employees contribution and motivation as well benefits for customers Measured values will vary widely between businesses covering for example new product revenue spending in RD time to market customer and employee perception satisfaction number of patents additional sales resulting from past innovations Political level For the political level measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region competitive advantage through innovation In this context organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management The OECD Oslo Manual 1995 suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation Some people consider the Oslo Manual complementary to the Frascati Manual from 1963 The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation and includes marketing and organizational innovation These standards are used for example in the European Community Innovation Surveys Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure for example investment in RD Research and Development as percentage of GNP Gross National Product Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions The EU Lisbon Strategy has set as a goal that their average expenditure on RD should be 3 of GDP Indicators Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the science and technology mode STmode or STImode while the learning by doing using and interacting mode DUImode is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done For example an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment but lacks crucial doing using and interacting tasks important for innovation A common industry view unsupported by empirical evidence is that comparative costeffectiveness research is a form of price control which reduces returns to industry and thus limits RD expenditure stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets Some academics claim costeffectiveness research is a valuable valuebased measure of innovation which accords truly significant therapeutic advances ie providing health gain higher prices than free market mechanisms Such valuebased pricing has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse Research and Development Expenditure Credit An Australian academic developed the case that national comparative costeffectiveness analysis systems should be viewed as measuring health innovation as an evidencebased policy concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets a method which requires strong antitrust laws to be effective on the basis that both methods of assessing pharmaceutical innovations are mentioned in annex 2C1 of the AustraliaUnited States Free Trade Agreement Rate Indices Several indices attempt to measure innovation and rank entities based on these measures such as The Bloomberg Innovation Index The Bogota Manual similar to the Oslo Manual is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean countries The Creative Class developed by Richard Florida The EIU Innovation Ranking The Global Competitiveness Report The Global Innovation Index GII by INSEAD The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation ITIF Index The Innovation Capacity Index ICI published by a large number of international professors working in a collaborative fashion The top scorers of ICI 2009–2010 were 1 Sweden 822 2 Finland 778 and 3 United States 775 The Innovation Index developed by the Indiana Business Research Center to measure innovation capacity at the county or regional level in the United States The Innovation Union Scoreboard The innovationsindikator for Germany developed by the Federation of German Industries Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie in 2005 The INSEAD Innovation Efficacy Index The International Innovation Index produced jointly by The Boston Consulting Group the National Association of Manufacturers and its nonpartisan research affiliate The Manufacturing Institute is a worldwide index measuring the level of innovation in a country NAM describes it as the largest and most comprehensive global index of its kind The Management Innovation Index Model for Managing Intangibility of Organizational Creativity Management Innovation Index The NYCEDC Innovation Index by the New York City Economic Development Corporation tracks New York City’s transformation into a center for hightech innovation It measures innovation in the City’s growing science and technology industries and is designed to capture the effect of innovation on the City’s economy The Oslo Manual is focused on North America Europe and other rich economies The State Technology and Science Index developed by the Milken Institute is a USwide benchmark to measure the science and technology capabilities that furnish high paying jobs based around key components The World Competitiveness Scoreboard Rankings Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation Common areas of focus include hightech companies manufacturing patents post secondary education research and development and research personnel The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index However studies may vary widely for example the Global Innovation Index 2016 ranks Switzerland as number one wherein countries like South Korea and Japan do not even make the top ten Future In 2005 Jonathan Huebner a physicist working at the Pentagons Naval Air Warfare Center argued on the basis of both US patents and world technological breakthroughs per capita that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since In his article he asked Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages In later comments to New Scientist magazine Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the Dark Ages he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves John Smart criticized the claim and asserted that technological singularity researcher Ray Kurzweil and others showed a clear trend of acceleration not deceleration when it came to innovations The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in citing Second Life and eHarmony as proof of accelerating innovation to which Huebner replied However Huebners findings were confirmed in 2010 with US Patent Office data and in a 2012 paper Innovation and international development The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid2000s among major international development actors such as DFID Gates Foundations use of the Grand Challenge funding model and USAIDs Global Development Lab Networks have been established to support innovation in development such as DLab at MIT Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in developing countries such as DFIDs Global Innovation Fund Human Development Innovation Fund and in partnership with USAID the Global Development Innovation Ventures Government policies Given the noticeable effects on efficiency quality of life and productive growth innovation is a key factor in society and economy Consequently policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits from funding Research and Development to supporting regulatory change funding the development of innovation clusters and using public purchasing and standardisation to pull innovation through For instance experts are advocating that the US federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation a nimble collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics strengthen industryuniversity partnerships and support innovation economic development initiatives especially to strengthen regional clusters Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision manufacturing information technology and clean energy other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt carbon footprint and oil dependence The US Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative In addition federal grants in RD a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth should be expanded to levels similar to Japan Finland South Korea and Switzerland in order to stay globally competitive Also such grants should be better procured to metropolitan areas the essential engines of the American economy Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japans Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology MEXT Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of Science and Technology in the Peoples Republic of China Furthermore Russias innovation programme is the Medvedev modernisation programme which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation Also the Government of Western Australia has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments Landgate was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program The Cairns Region established the Tropical Innovation Awards in 2010 open to all businesses in Australia The 2011 Awards were extended to include participants from all Tropical Zone Countries Innovators An innovator in a general sense is a person or an organization who is one of the first to introduce into reality something better than before Something that opens up a new area for others and achieves an innovation See also
