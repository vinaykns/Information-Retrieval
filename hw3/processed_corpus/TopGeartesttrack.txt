 The Top Gear test track is used by the BBC automotive television programme Top Gear It is located at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey United Kingdom The track was designed by Lotus Cars as a testing facility for the Colin Chapmanrun company with many of its Formula One cars tested there It is used to test both cars and drivers seen on the programme mainly in Power Laps and Star in a Reasonably Priced Car For the 23rd series of Top Gear the track was expanded with a rallycross section for the new Star in a Rallycross Car segment In December 2016 planning permission was granted for 1800 homes to be built on the current site of the aerodrome As part of the redevelopment it is proposed that the track and associated aerodrome infrastructure such as the runway drag strip be demolished Layout The track is on a former Royal Canadian Air Force airbase constructed during the Second World War and later used by British Aerospace as a manufacturing and test facility The tracks main route marked by painted lines and simple structures such as stacks of tyres was designed by test drivers from Lotus The layout of the track is designed to put the car through various conditions ranging from provoking understeer to testing brake balance and tyres The track is approximately 175 miles 282 km long It is considered to be an equaliser for cars since according to Richard Hammond both 0–60 miles per hour 0–966 kmh times and top speed are totally meaningless The track also incorporates a drag strip although this is not used for timed segments it does feature in some challenges and other features on the show The course starts on the perimeter road outside the Top Gear studio The first bend is a fast rightleft kink named Crooner Curves Willson Bend is the first proper turn on the track and the first corner usually seen when The Stig is lapping a car Chicago a long righthand around a tyre wall onto the main runway was designed by Lotus as a steady state corner designed to highlight understeer or oversteer of the chassis Next is Hammerhead a leftthenright corner which again highlights understeer and oversteer The track comes to a righthand curve then the course turns right through the flatout section called the Follow Through After the left hand Bentley Bend named after the person who first discovered Jeremy Clarkson and former Top Gear presenter Jon Bentley but commonly referred to simply as the tyres the course comes to Bacharach Bend which after the first series has been referred to as the Penultimate Corner or the Secondtolast Corner and is often regarded as one of the most challenging on the course The final turn before the finish line is Gambon in honour of Sir Michael Gambon who completed the turn on two wheels in episode 8 of Series 1 Prior to this the corner was known as Carpenters Corner Usage The track is used routinely for the Star in a ReasonablyPriced Car and Power Laps segments on Top Gear It also serves myriad roles in other portions of the programme especially in testing cars and in challenges When testing cars they are often driven around the airfield by the presenters Afterwards they are taken around the test track by The Stig to set a lap time Occasionally drag races and speed tests are held on the runway Cars acquired during challenges must often post lap times driven by either one of the presenters or The Stig around the track against either a target time or a time set by The Stig in another vehicle During many challenges the track is used in more unorthodox fashions — for instance serving as a makeshift motorway lane during a challenge testing tailgating prowess with vans Power Laps Power Laps is a segment of the programme in which The Stig completes a lap around the track in a reviewed car to compare its performance to previous contenders To be eligible to appear on the Power Lap Times board a vehicle must be a roadlegal production car and must have sufficient ride height to clear a standard speed bump referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed Whenever a nonqualifying vehicle is raced the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board for example the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher 1107 was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres All laps are timed with the cars manufacturerprovided adjustable settings configured for maximum performance — all adjustable suspensions are set at their most efficient all gear shift maps are at their most aggressive and driving aids such as traction control are deactivated Lap times do not offer complete comparisons between the cars mainly because wet or otherwise poor weather conditions see time deductions below can negatively affect lap times The Power Board Main article List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times Due to the size of the list only the top 20 are shown See List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times for the full list The second most powerful production car ever featured on Top Gear the 1001 PS 987 bhp 736 kW Bugatti Veyron was taken around the track by The Stig in Series 12 Episode 4 after 3 years of waiting However it disappointed the team by only managing fifth place on the Power Board currently 16th an unexpectedly low position ultimately attributed to the cars kerb weight of 1888 kg 4162 lb more than any of the four faster cars In Series 15 Episode 5 however the Stig took the 1200 PS Super Sport version around the track in 1168 thus setting a new lap record For the 1176 lap the Koenigsegg CCX written as Koeniggggsenisseggsegnignigsegigisegccx2 with the Top Gear wing on a muchlonger magnetic strip because none of the presenters were able to spell Koenigsegg was fitted with an optional rear spoiler to provide downforce after The Stig spun the unmodified version off the track The Stig allegedly recommended this modification correctly predicting that the car would then be the fastest ever round the track although Koenigsegg stated that the improvement was due to other adjustments Lap times of nonqualifying vehicles A nonqualifying vehicle is one that does not meet the presenters requirements to remain on the board that is one that is not a road car which according to Top Gear means being available to buy fully roadlegal lights indicators registration profile tyres etc and streetworthy ie able to negotiate a speed bump The Caparo Radical and Westfield are roadlegal in the UK but are unable to clear a speed bump According to Caparo the car driven by Top Gear was a prototype that didnt feature the adjustable ride height found on the production model Because The Stig set his time in the nonadjustable prototype and the production version has not been driven around the track the Caparos time remains ineligible for the Power Lap board NonTop Gear laps Occasionally attempts at the Power Lap record are made without the support of the BBC The following laps of Dunsfold were recorded filmed and promoted independently of the Top Gear television programme Ultima claim that their motive for running a nontelevised lap was that they felt that the GTR was being specifically ignored by the producers of Top Gear Why Dunlop – Injection chose to run a lap of the Dunsfold circuit is not stated although it is noticeable that the slower official Caterham run was limited by cold tyres Celebrity laps Star in a Reasonably Priced Car series 122 Star in a Reasonably Priced Car was a recurring segment on Top Gear During most programmes a celebrity usually but not exclusively of British fame is interviewed by Jeremy Clarkson Discussion is normally amusing and focuses on carrelated matters such as the celebritys car history Then Clarkson and the studio audience watch the guests fastest lap on the Top Gear test track after which Clarkson puts the celebritys time on the time board Suzuki Liana 2002–2005 For the first seven series the car driven for lap times was a Suzuki Liana When first introduced the car was worth £9995 The car used is stock except for a roll cage and racing seats added as safety measures Each guest practises with The Stig before making several attempts to complete the test track in the fastest time The guest does not learn their time until the interview Practice laps crashes and the drivers facial expressions are also shown during the segment The two slowest laps on the Liana celebrity list are held by Terry Wogan and Richard Whiteley both of whom were beaten by Billy Baxter a Bosnian war veteran who is completely blind He guided the Liana through the track under direction from Clarkson in the passenger seat in a time of 2 minutes 2 seconds which was 14 seconds quicker than Terry Wogan and 4 seconds faster than Richard Whiteley The fastest nonprofessional driver was Ellen MacArthur Unlike most contenders she made no comments to the camera during her lap She completed the lap in 1 minute 467 seconds beating Jimmy Carr by 02 seconds The current fastest professional driver in the Liana is Daniel Ricciardo with 1422 The Liana endured considerable abuse from the stars while undertaking their laps In one incident actor Michael Gambon clipped the final corner taking the car onto two wheels It was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named Gambon Corner When Lionel Richie drove the Liana one of the front wheels fell off invoking Clarkson to coin the term pulling a Lionel Trevor Eve also lost a wheel The former British transport minister Stephen Ladyman added further injury to the Liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a tyre wall David Soul destroyed the gearbox of two Lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style Patrick Kielty broke the Lianas front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass Christopher Eccleston was the only celebrity to use a Liana with an automatic transmission because a hesitant Eccleston admitted he was only qualified to drive an automatic To accommodate his needs Top Gear succeeded in borrowing an automatic Liana of which only 40 existed in the UK As a reference to his role in Doctor Who the automatic Liana was shown materialising onto the racing track with a TARDIS materialisation sound effect played over it The Liana has also been modified on several occasions David Souls Liana featured a red police light and a white stripe in reference to his Starsky and Hutch role Johnny Vegas was provided with Lplates as he had not passed his driving test at the time When Justin Hawkins came on the show the Liana he drove had flame decals pasted on it Actor Sanjeev Bhaskar had an ornate tissue box placed in the back an homage to Indian drivers In its service the Liana covered 1600 laps of the circuit went through 400 tyres its brakes were changed 100 times and it required six new clutches two new hubs driveshafts wishbones struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror In July 2005 Formula One driver Damon Hill appeared on the show for the first time as the star This was kept a surprise to the audience and the viewing public and when Nigel Mansell came on the show it was covered up in magazines and on the internet by saying that the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car would be Alan Titchmarsh Since Mansells appearance the Liana has remained in use as a vehicle reserved for Formula 1 drivers For some of the laps more than one person has been present in the car This was the case for Clarksons run when he had both Hammond and Jason Dawe in the car Trinny and Susannah were both in the car for each others runs Denise Van Outen was in the car when Johnny Vaughan did his lap Van Outen never did a lap driving the car Clarkson was also present as a navigator for Billy Baxters laps Liana leaderboard 1467 – Ellen MacArthur 1469 – Jimmy Carr 1471 – Simon

Lacetti 2006–2009 Starting with the eighth series the Liana was replaced by a Chevrolet Lacetti and a new blank scoreboard The format was changed so that each star would have five practice laps and then a final timed lap with no allowance being given for mishaps As a starter for the new car and format an open day was held for any celebrity who wanted to take part Seven stars recorded times that day James Hewitt who Jeremy and Richard referred to as the Well Spoken Man after failing to recognise him comedians Alan Davies and Jimmy Carr rock stars Rick Wakeman and Justin Hawkins footballer Les Ferdinand and actor Trevor Eve who topped the time at 1 minute 470 seconds Jimmy Carr who held second place in the Liana behind Ellen MacArthur spun off while doing his timed lap and got the second to one slowest time ever around the track at 2 minutes 891 seconds On 28 January 2007 Jamie Oliver posted a time of 14770 in melted snow and standing water Given the rivalry Oliver felt towards fellow celebrity chef and thenlapboard leader Gordon Ramsay Oliver asked that the 4second allowance normally granted for wet laps be used to put him at the top of the leaderboard just for a day Actress Billie Piper posted a time of 1483 but was deemed by The Stig to have failed to complete a lap properly as she failed to negotiate some corners The Stig suggested a threesecond time penalty but after Clarkson consulted the audience it was decided to let the time stand which her Doctor Who costar David Tennant tried to overturn on 23 December 2007 show at the end of the following series Clarkson remarked that if Tennant had worn a see through top like Piper for her interview he would have been faster than Simon Cowell In the 11 November 2007 episode Simon Cowell retook his status as the holder of the fastest lap with a time of 14590 According to Clarkson the cameramen said they had never seen such consistency in the practice laps However Cowell was knocked off the top spot in Series 11 by Jay Kay who now holds the fastest time in the Lacetti although Clarkson selected the fastest of Jay Kays times rather than the last run which was slower than Cowells time seemingly due to a dislike of Cowell he claimed earlier in the episode that Cowell had been at the top of the leaderboard for too long Had this not happened Cowell would have been knocked off the top by Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud Clarkson has referred to the part of the board with times of 151 and over as the Thespian Zone due to the propensity for classically trained actors to post slow times Series 11 featured a slight change to the format with two Stars per episode instead of the previous one although there had been a couple of editions in previous series with more than one guest Each of the pair are professionally associated with their fellow guest usually both either act in or present the same TV show Unlike previous episodes where two stars have appeared the stars drove individual laps without the other present in the car On 28 March 2010 Richard Hammond attended the demolition of the two 550 ft chimneys at Lafarge Cements Northfleet Works On the first episode of Series 15 it was shown that the Lacetti was partially crushed by placing it in the path of one of the falling chimneys Lacetti leaderboard 14581 – Jay Kay 14585 – Brian Johnson 14587 – Kevin McCloud 1459 – Simon

their own list with regard to lap times because of their exceptional skill level When the Liana was pulled out from retirement to allow Jenson Button to make a time Clarkson noted that the Liana would be pulled out for use by Formula 1 drivers in the future The original black Stig and the first white Stig have done laps around the track in the Suzuki Liana Both had their times removed from the leaderboard upon their departure The first Stig was Perry McCarthy who once test drove for the Williams F1 team and drove for the illfated Andrea Moda Formula One team The second Stig was Ben Collins in the first episode of Series 13 the Stig was revealed to be Michael Schumacher although this was a joke in the vein of the rest of his appearance on the show On 6 July 2011 Sebastian Vettel managed to top the board with a time of 1440 Vettels lap was the first time someone taking a Formula One drivers line through the first corner was able to top The Stigs time as Rubens Barrichello took the tighter line Clarkson also mentioned on this episode that the current Stig has yet to do a lap of the track in the Liana therefore there is currently no time on the board for the Stig On 17 February 2013 Lewis Hamilton returned to do a dry lap and lowered the F1 Drivers record by 11s to 1429 This was in the wake of his move to Mercedes AMG for the 2013 season On 8 February 2015 Daniel Ricciardo topped the board with a lap time of 1422 Ricciardo took the tighter line through the first corner claiming that it covered less distance The times and details of the F1 drivers laps are as follows

deductions Sometimes an additional term is written next to the time such as H for hot This indicates that The Stig and the Top Gear team consider that the prevalent weather conditions have affected the lap time or cars performance The time on the board is not adapted eg 1500 MM mildly moist is deemed to be equivalent to 1480 on a normal dry track but is listed amongst the 150 times The only lap ever done in the snow was that of Damian Lewis whose time of 2091 holds the record as the slowest ever completed lap due to this he was placed on a special separate snow board Lewis Hamilton on his first appearance had his lap listed as WO wet and oily due to large slicks of oil left on the track after an earlier car test The following list describes how many seconds it costs a car or gives a

Turismo 5 Prologue would be able to download episodes of Top Gear within the game and that the test track would be one of the included circuits in the full game Gran Turismo 5 A very basic yet driveable version of the track appeared around 2003 for the PC hardcore racing simulation Grand Prix Legends There is also a version of the test track for the realistic PC racing simulation rFactor produced with permission from Dunsfold park The track has also been produced as an addon for World Racing 2 Top Gear have also added a basic version of the test track on the games section of their own website with the title of Be a star in our reasonably priced car A Top Gear mobile phone game also features the track The game Gran Turismo 5 developed by Polyphony Digital features a fully rendered version of the Top Gear track Players have the ability to drive and race on the track The track also appeared in Forza Motorsport 4 the Top Gear logo appeared in a trailer for Forza 4 on the Top Gear website Cars were shown racing in the followthrough section during the E3 2011 trailer It is known that in the actual game there is options to race on the full track race both of the rings in separate races and race on Top Gears drag race mile There is also an achievement in Forza 4 for completing a lap of the Top Gear Test Track in the Kia Ceed fittingly named Star in a reasonably priced car Forza
