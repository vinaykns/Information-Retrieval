 Government of Wales redirects here For an overview of the political system of Wales see Politics of Wales The Welsh Government Welsh Llywodraeth Cymru is the executive of the devolved National Assembly for Wales The government was established in 1999 as the Welsh Assembly Government by the Government of Wales Act 1998 which created a devolved administration for Wales in line with the result of the 1997 referendum on Welsh devolution The government consists of cabinet secretaries who attend cabinet meetings and ministers who do not and also of a counsel general It is led by the first minister usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly who selects cabinet secretaries ministers and deputy ministers with the approval of the assembly The government is responsible for tabling policy in devolved areas for consideration by the assembly and implementing policy that has been approved by it History 1999 to 2007 Executive Committee of the National Assembly As initially established the Welsh Government had no independent executive powers in law unlike for instance the Scottish ministers and British government ministers The National Assembly was established as a body corporate by the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the executive as a committee of the assembly only had those powers that the assembly as a whole voted to delegate to ministers The Government of Wales Act 2006 formally separated the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government giving Welsh ministers independent executive authority this taking effect after the May 2007 elections Following separation the Welsh ministers exercise functions in their own right Further transfers of executive functions from the British government can be made directly to the Welsh ministers with their consent by an Order in Council approved by the British parliament Separation was designed to clarify the respective roles of the assembly and the government Under the structures established by the Government of Wales Act 2006 the role of Welsh ministers is to make decisions develop and implement policy exercise executive functions and make statutory instruments The 60 assembly members in the National Assembly scrutinise the governments decisions and policies hold ministers to account approve budgets for the Welsh Governments programmes and enact acts of assembly on subjects that have been devolved to the Welsh administration The result mirrored much more closely the relationship between the British government and British parliament and that between the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament After the 2007 election of the National Assembly for Wales Legal separation The new arrangements provided for in the Government of Wales Act 2006 created a formal legal separation between the National Assembly for Wales comprising 60 assembly members and the Welsh Government comprising the First Minister Welsh ministers deputy ministers and the counsel general This separation between the two bodies took effect on the appointment of the First Minister by Queen Elizabeth II following the assembly election on 3 May 2007 Separation was meant to clarify the respective roles of the assembly and the government The role of the government is to make decisions develop and implement policy exercise executive functions and make statutory instruments The 60 assembly members in the National Assembly scrutinise the Welsh Governments decisions and policies hold ministers to account approve budgets for the Welsh Governments programmes and have the power to enact assembly measures on certain matters Assembly measures can now go further than the subordinate legislation which the assembly had the power to make prior to 2007 Transfer of functions The assemblys functions including that of making subordinate legislation in the main transferred to the Welsh ministers upon separation A third body was also established under the 2006 Act from May 2007 called the National Assembly for Wales Commission It employs the staff supporting the new National Assembly for Wales and holds property enters into contracts and provides support services on its behalf Welsh ministers The 2006 Act made new provision for the appointment of Welsh ministers The First Minister is nominated by the Assembly and then appointed by Her Majesty the Queen The First Minister then appoints the Welsh Ministers and the Deputy Welsh Ministers with the approval of Her Majesty The Act created a new post of Counsel General for Wales the principal source of legal advice to the Welsh Government The Counsel General is appointed by the Queen on the nomination of the First Minister whose recommendation must be agreed by the National Assembly The Counsel General may be but does not have to be an Assembly Member The Act permits a maximum of 12 Welsh Ministers which includes Deputy Welsh Ministers but excludes the First Minister and the Counsel General Accordingly the maximum size of the Welsh Government is 14 2011 referendum on lawmaking powers Functions and areas of competence Following the yes vote in the referendum on further lawmaking powers for the assembly
