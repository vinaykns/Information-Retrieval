 For the usage in geography see Elevation For the ISO definitions see Altitude height and depth For other uses see Altitude disambiguation Not to be confused with Attitude Altitude or height sometimes known as depth is defined based on the context in which it is used aviation geometry geographical survey sport and many more As a general definition altitude is a distance measurement usually in the vertical or up direction between a reference datum and a point or object The reference datum also often varies according to the context Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage Vertical distance measurements in the down direction are commonly referred to as depth In aviation See also Sea level § Aviation In aviation the term altitude can have several meanings and is always qualified by explicitly adding a modifier eg true altitude or implicitly through the context of the communication Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used Aviation altitude is measured using either mean sea level MSL or local ground level above ground level or AGL as the reference datum Pressure altitude divided by 100 feet 30 m as the flight level and is used above the transition altitude 18000 feet 5500 m in the US but may be as low as 3000 feet 910 m in other jurisdictions so when the altimeter reads 18000 ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at Flight level 180 When flying at a flight level the altimeter is always set to standard pressure 2992 inHg or 101325 hPa On the flight deck the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance feet or metres instead of atmospheric pressure There are several types of aviation altitude Indicated altitude is the reading on the altimeter when it is set to the local barometric pressure at mean sea level In UK aviation radiotelephony usage the vertical distance of a level a point or an object considered as a point measured from mean sea level this is referred to over the radio as altitudesee QNH Absolute altitude is the height of the aircraft above the terrain over which it is flying It can be measured using a radar altimeter or absolute altimeter Also referred to as radar height or feetmetres above ground level AGL True altitude is the actual elevation above mean sea level It is indicated altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature and pressure Height is the elevation above a ground reference point commonly the terrain elevation In UK aviation radiotelephony usage the vertical distance of a level a point or an object considered as a point measured from a specified datum this is referred to over the radio as height where the specified datum is the airfield elevation see QFE Pressure altitude is the elevation above a standard datum airpressure plane typically 101325 millibars or 2992 Hg Pressure altitude is used to indicate flight level which is the standard for altitude reporting in the US in Class A airspace above roughly 18000 feet Pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the altimeter setting is 2992 Hg or 101325 millibars Density altitude is the altitude corrected for nonISA International Standard Atmosphere atmospheric conditions Aircraft performance depends on density altitude which is affected by barometric pressure humidity and temperature On a very hot day density altitude at an airport especially one at a high elevation may be so high as to preclude takeoff particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude Indicated altitude – the altitude shown on the altimeter Absolute altitude – altitude in terms of the distance above the ground directly below True altitude – altitude in terms of elevation above sea level Height – altitude in terms of the distance above a certain point Pressure altitude – the air pressure in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere Density altitude – the density of the air in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere in the air In atmospheric studies Atmospheric regions The Earths atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions These regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles The altitudes stated below are averages Troposphere — surface to 8000 metres 50 mi at the poles – 18000 metres 11 mi at the equator ending at the Tropopause Stratosphere — Troposphere to 50 kilometres 31 mi Mesosphere — Stratosphere to 85 kilometres 53 mi Thermosphere — Mesosphere to 675 kilometres 419 mi Exosphere — Thermosphere to 10000 kilometres 6200 mi High altitude and low pressure Regions on the Earths surface or in its atmosphere that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2400 metres 8000 ft above sea level At high altitude atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level This is due to two competing physical effects gravity which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground and the heat content of the air which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand High altitude and low temperature The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it The ground then heats the air at the surface If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly 333 K 60 °C 140 °F and the temperature would decay exponentially with height However when air is hot it tends to expand which lowers its density Thus hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward This is the process of convection Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel at air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings Air is a poor conductor of heat so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat This is known as an adiabatic process which has a characteristic pressuretemperature curve As the pressure gets lower the temperature decreases The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate which is approximately 98 °C per kilometer or 54 °F per 1000 feet of altitude Note that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization As air rises and cools it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor The water vapor condenses forming clouds and releases heat which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate 55 °C per kilometer or 3 °F per 1000 feet As an average the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO defines an international standard atmosphere ISA with a temperature lapse rate of 649 °C per kilometer 356 °F per 1000 feet The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location Finally note that only the troposphere up to approximately 11 kilometres 36000 ft of altitude in the Earths atmosphere undergoes notable convection in the stratosphere there is little vertical convection Effects on organisms Humans Main article Effects of high altitude on humans Medicine recognizes that altitudes above 1500 metres 4900 ft start to affect humans and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above 5500–6000 metres 18000–19700 ft for more than two years As the altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen The lack of oxygen above 2400 metres 8000 ft can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness high altitude pulmonary edema and high altitude cerebral edema The higher the altitude the more likely are serious effects The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster having a higher heart rate and adjusting its blood chemistry It can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude However above 8000 metres 26000 ft in the death zone altitude acclimatization becomes impossible There is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes Additionally there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States In addition the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimers disease via action of erythropoietin a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia However people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far Athletes For athletes high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance For explosive events sprints up to 400 metres long jump triple jump the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance which generally results in improved athletic performance For endurance events races of 5000 metres or more the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athletes performance at high altitude Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance the International Association of Athletic Federations IAAF for example marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1000 metres 3300 ft with the letter A Athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level These changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field distance running triathlon cycling and swimming Other organisms Main article Organisms at high altitude Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging Despite these environmental conditions many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny For example small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures due to their small volume to surface area ratio As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic There is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures These factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats meaning there will be less energy available for consumption growth and activity However some species such as birdsthrive at high altitude Birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for highaltitude flight See also Altitude height and depth Atmosphere of Earth List of capital cities by altitude Coffin corner aerodynamics At higher
