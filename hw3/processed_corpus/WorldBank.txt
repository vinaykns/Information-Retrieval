 Not to be confused with World Bank Group The World Bank WB is an international financial institution that provides loans to developing countries for capital programs It is the largest financial institution in the world It comprises two institutions the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development IBRD and the International Development Association IDA The World Bank is a component of the World Bank Group which is part of the United Nations system The World Banks stated official goal is the reduction of poverty However according to its Articles of Agreement all its decisions must be guided by a commitment to the promotion of foreign investment and international trade and to the facilitation of capital investment World Bank Group The World Bank is different from the World Bank Group an extended family of five international organizations International Bank for Reconstruction and Development IBRD International Development Association IDA International Finance Corporation IFC Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency MIGA International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ICSID History The World Bank was created at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference along with three other institutions including the International Monetary Fund IMF The president of the World Bank is traditionally an American The World Bank and the IMF are both based in Washington DC and work closely with each other Although many countries were represented at the Bretton Woods Conference the United States and United Kingdom were the most powerful in attendance and dominated the negotiations 1944–1974 Before 1974 the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small The Banks staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank Fiscal conservatism ruled and loan applications had to meet strict criteria The first country to receive a World Bank loan was France The Banks president at the time John McCloy chose France over two other applicants Poland and Chile The loan was for US250 million half the amount requested and it came with strict conditions France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions In addition before the loan was approved the United States State Department told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed The French government complied with this diktat and removed the Communist coalition government the socalled tripartisme Within hours the loan to France was approved When the Marshall Plan went into effect in 1947 many European countries began receiving aid from other sources Faced with this competition the World Bank shifted its focus to nonEuropean countries Until 1968 its loans were earmarked for the construction of incomeproducing infrastructure such as seaports highway systems and power plants that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan In 1960 the International Development Association was formed as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED providing soft loans to developing countries 1974–1980 From 1974 to 1980 the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people in the developing world The size and number of loans to borrowers was greatly increased as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors These changes can be attributed to Robert McNamara who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by Lyndon B Johnson McNamara implored bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of funding Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of third world debt From 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20 In 1980 the World Bank Administrative Tribunal was established to decide on disputes between the World Bank Group and its staff where allegation of nonobservance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been honored 1980–1989 In 1980 McNamara was succeeded by US President Jimmy Carters nominee Alden W Clausen Clausen replaced many members of McNamaras staff and instituted a new ideological focus His 1982 decision to replace the banks Chief Economist Hollis B Chenery with Anne Krueger was an indication of this new focus Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing Third World governments as rentseeking states During the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service ThirdWorld debt and structural adjustment policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations UNICEF reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for reduced health nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in Asia Latin America and Africa 1989–present Beginning in 1989 in response to harsh criticism from many groups the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism It also formed an implementing agency in accordance with the Montreal Protocols to stop ozonedepletion damage to the Earths atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95 of ozonedepleting chemicals with a target date of 2015 Since then in accordance with its socalled Six Strategic Themes the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development For example in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation especially in the Amazon it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment In order to promote global public goods the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces In 2000 the bank announced a war on AIDS and in 2011 the Bank joined the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership Less recently a project in Seychelles to promote local tourism by the name of project MAGIC was launched in 2010 Its successor project TIME was scheduled to be launched in 2012 Traditionally based on a tacit understanding between the United States and Europe the president of the World Bank has always been selected from candidates nominated by the United States In 2012 for the first time two nonUS citizens were nominated On 23 March 2012 US President Barack Obama announced that the United States would nominate Jim Yong Kim as the next president of the Bank Jim Yong Kim was elected on 27 April 2012 Criteria Various developments had brought the Millennium Development Goals targets for 2015 within reach in some cases For the goals to be realized six criteria must be met stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states more effort in health and education integration of the development and environment agendas more as well as better aid movement on trade negotiations and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger From 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth Although results vary widely within regions and countries the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty Africas poverty however is expected to rise and most of the 36 countries where 90 of the worlds undernourished children live are in Africa Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving undernutrition Achieve Universal Primary Education The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80 in 1991 to 88 in 2005 Still about 72 million children of primary school age 57 of them girls were not being educated as of 2005 Promote Gender Equality The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market yet far more women than men worldwide more than 60 – are contributing but unpaid family workers The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance womens economic empowerment and promote shared growth Reduce Child Mortality There is some improvement in survival rates globally accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and SubSaharan Africa An estimated 10 millionplus children under five died in 2005 most of their deaths were from preventable causes Improve Maternal Health Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in SubSaharan Africa and Asia There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible Combat HIVAIDS Malaria and Other Diseases Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow In the eight worsthit southern African countries prevalence is above 15 percent Treatment has increased globally but still meets only 30 percent of needs with wide variations across countries AIDS remains the leading cause of death in SubSaharan Africa 16 million deaths in 2007 There are 300 to 500 million cases of malaria each year leading to more than 1 million deaths Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in SubSaharan Africa Ensure Environmental Sustainability Deforestation remains a critical problem particularly in regions of biological diversity which continues to decline Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement Develop a Global Partnership for Development Donor countries have renewed their commitment Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Groups collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs realization To make sure that World Bankfinanced operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation environmental social and legal safeguards were defined However these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet At the World Banks annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated which was welcomed by several civil society organisations Leadership The President of the Bank is the president of the entire World Bank Group The president currently Jim Yong Kim is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Boards of Directors and for overall management of the Bank Traditionally the President of the Bank has always been a US citizen nominated by the United States the largest shareholder in the bank the managing director of the International Monetary Fund having always been a European The nominee is subject to confirmation by the Board of Executive Directors to serve for a fiveyear renewable term While most World Bank presidents have had banking experience some have not The vice presidents of the Bank are its principal managers in charge of regions sectors networks and functions There are two Executive Vice presidents three Senior Vice presidents and 24 Vice presidents The Boards of Directors consist of the World Bank Group President and 25 Executive Directors The President is the presiding officer and ordinarily has no vote except a deciding vote in case of an equal division The Executive Directors as individuals cannot exercise any power nor commit or represent the Bank unless specifically authorized by the Boards to do so With the term beginning 1 November 2010 the number of Executive Directors increased by one to 25 List of

reduction strategies For the poorest developing countries in the world the banks assistance plans are based on poverty reduction strategies by combining a crosssection of local groups with an extensive analysis of the countrys financial and economic situation the World Bank develops a strategy pertaining uniquely to the country in question The government then identifies the countrys priorities and targets for the reduction of poverty and the World Bank aligns its aid efforts correspondingly Fortyfive countries pledged US251 billion in aid for the worlds poorest countries aid that goes to the World Bank International Development Association IDA which distributes the loans to eighty poorer countries While wealthier nations sometimes fund their own aid projects including those for diseases and although IDA is the recipient of criticism Robert B Zoellick the former president of the World Bank said when the loans were announced on 15 December 2007 that IDA money is the core funding that the poorest developing countries rely on World Bank organizes Development Marketplace Awards a competitive grant program that surfaces and funds innovative development projects with high

underserved lowincome groups Global partnerships and initiatives The World Bank has been assigned temporary management responsibility of the Clean Technology Fund CTF focused on making renewable energy costcompetitive with coalfired power as quickly as possible but this may not continue after UNs Copenhagen climate change conference in December 2009 because of the Banks continued investment

Global Development Learning Network GDLN is a partnership of over 120 learning centers GDLN Affiliates in nearly 80 countries around the world GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues GDLN clients are typically NGOs government private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconferencebased activities a year on behalf of their clients reaching some 90000 people worldwide Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs GDLN Asia Pacific The GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate or are planned in 20 countries Australia Mongolia Cambodia China Indonesia Singapore Philippines Sri Lanka Japan Papua New Guinea South Korea Thailand Laos Timor Leste Fiji Afghanistan Bangladesh India Nepal and New Zealand With over 180 Distance Learning Centers it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand GDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLNs East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006 Its vision is to become the premier network exchanging ideas experience and knowhow across the Asia Pacific Region GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and in accordance with the Charter a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed The committee comprises China 2 Australia 1 Thailand 1 The World Bank 1 and finally a nominee of the Government of Japan 1 The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok Thailand founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific The Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a Foundation The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status GDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist as the network evolves Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand – Chulalongkorn University Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre TDLC Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University ANU Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand ANU has offered to assist the governing committee by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved The JUSTPAL Network A Justice Sector PeerAssisted Learning JUSTPAL Network was launched in April 2011 by

in this agreement was a joint venture to create an electronic version of the publication via the World Wide Web Today Development Business is the primary publication for all major multilateral development banks United Nations agencies and several national governments many of whom have made the publication of their tenders and contracts in Development Business a mandatory requirement The World Bank or the World Bank Group is also a sitting observer in the United Nations Development Group Open data initiative The World Bank collects and processes large amounts of data and generates them on the basis of economic models These data and models have gradually been made available to the public in a way that encourages reuse whereas the recent publications describing them are available

for its research outputs and knowledge products The World Banks repository is listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories re3dataorg Criticisms The World Bank has long been criticized by nongovernmental organizations such as the indigenous rights group Survival International and academics including its former Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises Henry Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system it was designed within would promote world inflation and a world in which international trade is Statedominated when they were being advocated Stiglitz argued that the socalled free market reform policies that the Bank advocates are often harmful to economic development if implemented badly too quickly shock therapy in the wrong sequence or in weak uncompetitive economies Similarly Carmine Guerriero notices that these reforms have introduced in developing countries regulatory institutions typical of the common law legal tradition because allegedly more efficient according to the legal origins theory The latter however has been fiercely criticized since it does not take into account that the legal institutions transplanted during the European colonization have been then reformed This issue makes the legal origins theorys inference unreliable and the Work Bank reforms detrimental One of the strongest criticisms of the World Bank has been the way in which it is governed While the World Bank represents 188 countries it is run by a small number of economically powerful countries These countries which also provide most of the institutions funding choose the leadership and senior management of the World Bank and so their interests dominate the bank Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the World Banks role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank under apartheid and therefore a pillar of global apartheid In the 1990s the World Bank and the IMF forged the Washington Consensus policies that included deregulation and liberalization of markets privatization and the downscaling of government Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development it was criticized for ignoring equity employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out Joseph Stiglitz argued that the Washington Consensus placed too much emphasis on the growth of GDP and not enough on the permanence of growth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations report criticized the World Bank and other international financial institutions for focusing too much on issuing loans rather than on achieving concrete development results within a finite period of time and called on the institution to strengthen anticorruption efforts Criticism of the World Bank often takes the form of protesting as seen in recent events such as the World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests the October Rebellion and the Battle of Seattle Such demonstrations have occurred all over the world even among the Brazilian Kayapo people Another source of criticism has been the tradition of having an American head the bank implemented because the United States provides the majority of World Bank funding When economists from the World Bank visit poor countries to dispense cash and advice observed The Economist in 2012 they routinely tell governments to reject cronyism and fill each important job with the best candidate available It is good advice The World Bank should take it Jim Yong Kim a KoreanAmerican is the most recently appointed president of the World Bank Structural adjustment The effect of structural adjustment policies on poor countries has been one of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis The World Bank responded with structural adjustment loans which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance Some of these policies included encouraging production investment and labourintensive manufacturing changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily For some countries particularly in SubSaharan Africa economic growth regressed and inflation worsened The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans and the circumstances of the poor often worsened due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food as subsidies were lifted By the late 1980s international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the worlds poor The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans allowing for social spending to be maintained and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises In 1999 the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries Fairness of assistance conditions Some critics most prominently the author Naomi Klein are of the opinion that the World Bank Groups loans and aid have unfair conditions attached to them that reflect the interests financial power and political doctrines notably the Washington Consensus of the Bank and by extension the countries that are most influential within it Among other allegations Klein says the Groups credibility was damaged when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan when it demanded that Tanzania privatise its water system when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch when it demanded labour flexibility in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in postinvasion Iraq Sovereign immunity The World Bank requires sovereign immunity from countries it deals with Sovereign immunity waives a holder from all legal liability for their actions It is proposed that this immunity from responsibility is a shield which The World Bank wants to resort to for escaping accountability and security by the people As the United States has veto power it can prevent the World Bank from taking action against its interests Controversy PricewaterhouseCoopers 1998 World Bank favored PricewaterhouseCoopers as a consultant in a bid for privatizing the water distribution in Delhi India See also
