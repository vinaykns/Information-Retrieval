 This article is about modern movement architecture For architecture in the present day see contemporary architecture Modern architecture or modernist architecture is a term applied to a group of styles of architecture which emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II It was based upon new technologies of construction particularly the use of glass steel and reinforced concrete and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and BeauxArts styles that were popular in the 19th century Modern architecture continued to be the dominant architectural style for institutional and corporate buildings into 1980s when it was challenged by Postmodernism and then by Neomodernism and other schools which gradually supplanted it Notable architects important to the history and development of the modernist movement include Frank Lloyd Wright Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Le Corbusier Walter Gropius Konstantin Melnikov Erich Mendelsohn Joseph Eichler Richard Neutra Louis Sullivan Gerrit Rietveld Bruno Taut Gunnar Asplund Arne Jacobsen Oscar Niemeyer and Alvar Aalto Origins The Crystal Palace 1851 was one of the first buildings to have cast plate glass windows supported by a castiron frame The first house of reinforced concrete in SaintDenis near Paris designed by François Coignet 1853 The Home Insurance Building in Chicago by William Le Baron Jenney 1884 The Eiffel Tower being constructed August 188789 Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology engineering and building materials and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and to invent something that was purely functional and new The revolution in materials came first with the use of cast iron plate glass and reinforced concrete to build structures that were stronger lighter and taller The cast plate glass process was invented in 1848 allowing the manufacture of very large windows The Crystal Palace by Joseph Paxton at the Great Exhibition of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal curtain wall These developments together led to the first steelframed skyscraper the tenstory Home Insurance Building in Chicago built in 1884 by William Le Baron Jenney The iron frame construction of the Eiffel Tower then the tallest structure in the worldcaptured the imagination of millions of visitors to the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition French industrialist François Coignet was the first to use ironreinforced concrete that is concrete strengthened with iron bars as a technique for constructing buildings In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure a four story house in the suburbs of Paris A further important step forward was the invention of the safety elevator by Elisha Otis first demonstrated at the Crystal Palace exposition in 1852 which made tall office and apartment buildings practical Another important technology for the new architecture was electric light which greatly reduced the inherent danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century most notably eclecticism Victorian and Edwardian architecture and the BeauxArts architectural style This break with the past was particularly urged by the architectural theorist and historian Eugène ViolletleDuc In his 1872 book Entretiens sur LArchitecture he urged use the means and knowledge given to us by our times without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture For each function its material for each material its form and its ornament This book influenced a generation of architects including Louis Sullivan Victor Horta Hector Guimard and Antoni Gaudí Early modernism in Europe 19001914 The Glasgow School of Art by Charles Rennie MacIntosh 1896–99 Reinforced concrete apartment building by Auguste Perret Paris 1903 Austrian Postal Savings Bank in Vienna by Otto Wagner 19041906 The AEG Turbine factory by Peter Behrens 1909 The Steiner House in Vienna by Adolf Loos 1910 Stoclet Palace by Josef Hoffmann Brussels 19061911 The Théâtre des ChampsÉlysées in Paris by Auguste Perret 19111913 Stepped concrete apartment building in Paris by Henri Sauvage 19121914 The Fagus Factory in Alfeld by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer 1911–13 The Glass Pavilion in Cologne by German architect Bruno Taut 1914 At the end of the 19th century a few architects began to challenge the traditional Beaux Arts and Neoclassical styles that dominated architecture in Europe and the United States The Glasgow School of Art 189699 designed by Charles Rennie MacIntosh had a facade dominated by large vertical bays of windows The Art Nouveau style was launched in the 1890s by Victor Horta in Belgium and Hector Guimard in France it introduced new styles of decoration based on vegetal and floral forms In Barcelona Antonio Gaudi conceived architecture as a form of sculpture the facade of the Casa Battlo in Barcelona 19041907 had no straight lines it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles Architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques which gave them greater freedom to create new forms In 19031904 in Paris Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage began to use reinforced concrete previously only used for industrial structures to build apartment buildings Reinforced concrete which could be molded into any shape and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects The first concrete apartment buildings by Perret and Sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles but in 1905 Perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de Ponthieu in Paris here the concrete was left bare and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows Henri Sauvage added another construction innovation in an apartment building on Rue Vavin in Paris 19121914 the reinforced concrete building was in steps with each floor set back from the floor below creating a series of terraces Between 1910 and 1913 Auguste Perret built the Théâtre des ChampsÉlysées a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction with Art Deco sculptural basreliefs on he facade by Antoine Bourdelle Because of the concrete construction no columns blocked the spectators view of the stage Otto Wagner in Vienna was another pioneer of the new style In his book Moderne Arkchtekture 1895 he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture based on modern life He designed a stylized ornamental metro station at Karlsplatz in Vienna 1888–89 then an ornamental Art Nouveau residence Majolika House 1898 before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style without ornament in the Austrian Postal Savings Bank 19041906 Wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum The interior was purely functional and spare a large open space of steel glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself The Viennese architect Adolf Loos also began removing any ornament from his buildings His Steiner House in Vienna 1910 was an example of what he called rationalist architecture it had a simple stucco rectangual facade with square windows and no ornament The fame of the new movement which became known as the Vienna Secession spread beyond Austria Josef Hoffmann a student of Wagner constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture the Palais Stoclet in Brussels in 19061911 This residence built of brick covered with Norwegian marble was composed of geometric blocks wings and a tower A large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms The interior was decorated with paintings by Gustav Klimt and other artists and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture In Germany a modernist industrial movement Deutscher Werkbund German Work Federation had been created in Munich in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius a prominent architectural commentator Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists to turn out welldesigned high quality products and in the process to invent a new type of architecture The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms but quickly expanded The architects include Peter Behrens Theodor Fischer who served as its first president Josef Hoffmann and Richard Riemerschmid In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style the AEG turbine factory a functional monument of steel and concrete In 19111913 Adolf Meyer and Walter Gropius who had both worked for Behrens built another revolutionary industrial plant the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine a building without ornament where every construction element was on display The Werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 For the 1914 Cologne exhibition Bruno Taut built a revolutionary glass pavilion Early American modernism 19001914 See also Frank Lloyd Wright William H Winslow House by Frank Lloyd Wright Oak Park Illinois 189394

Like Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe he had no formal architectural training In 188793 he worked in the Chicago office of Louis Sullivan who pioneered the first tall steelframe office

York skyline in 1913 It was modern on the inside but neoGothic on the outside The neoGothic crown of the Woolworth Building by Cass Gilbert 1912 At the end of the 19th century the first skyscrapers began to appear in the United States They were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fastgrowing American cities and the availability of new technologies including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety elevator invented by Elisha Otis in 1852 The first steelframed skyscraper The Home Insurance Building in Chicago was ten stories high It was designed by William Le Baron Jenney in 1883 and was briefly the tallest building in the world It was surpassed by the Home Insurance Building of Louis Sullivan in Buffalo New York Sullivan built another monumental new structure the Carson Pirie Scott and Company Building in the heart of Chicago in 190406 While these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height the designs of their facades were in the more traditional neorenaissance NeoGothic and BeauxArts architecture The Woolworth Building designed by Cass Gilbert was completed in 1912 and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1929 Its exterior was in the NeoGothic style complete with decorative buttresses arches and spires which caused it be nicknamed the Cathedral of Commerce The Rise of Modernism 19191930 After the first World War a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of neoclassicism and the BeauxArts architecture style and the modernists led by Le Corbusier and Robert MalletStevens in France Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Germany and Konstantin Melnikov in the new Soviet Union who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration Art Deco architects such as Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage often made a compromise between the two combining modernist forms and stylized decoration

MalletStevens 1923 Hôtel Martel rue MalletStevens by Robert MalletStevens 19261927 The dominant figure in the rise of modernism in France was CharlesÉdouard Jeanneret a SwissFrench architect who in 1920 took the name Le Corbusier In 1920 he cofounded a journal called LEspirit Nouveau and energetically promoted architecture that was functional pure and free of any decoration or historical associations He was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism based on planned cities In 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people whose inhabitants lived in identical sixtystory tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland He designed modular houses which would be massproduced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks neighborhoods and cities In 1923 he published Toward an Architecture with his famous slogan a house is a machine for living in He tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans articles books conferences and participation in Expositions To illustrate his ideas in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around Paris They were all built according to a common system based upon the use of reinforced concrete and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans independent of the structure They were always white and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside The bestknown of these houses was the Villa Savoye built in 19281931 in the Paris suburb of Poissy An elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn it became an icon of modernist architecture The Bauhaus and the German Werkbund Main article Bauhaus The Bauhaus school building at Dessau Germany designed by Walter Gropius 1926 A Bauhaus design for a workers apartment by Walter Gropius 192830 The Barcelona Pavilion modern reconstruction by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 1929 In Germany two important modernist movements appeared after the first World War The Bauhaus was a school organized Weimar in 1919 under the direction of Walter Gropius Gropius was the son of the official state architect of Berlin who studied before the war with Peter Behrens and designed the modernist Fagus turbine factory The Bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar Academy of Arts and the school of technology In 1926 it was transferred from Weimar to Dessau Gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new purely functional modernist style he was encouraging The school brought together modernists in all fields the faculty included the modernist painters Vasily Kandinsky Joseph Albers and Paul Klee and the designer Marcel Breuer Gropius became an important theorist of modernism writing ‘’The Idea and Construction’’ in 1923 He was an advocate of standardization in architecture and the mass construction of rationallydesigned apartment blocks for factory workers In 1928 he was commissioned by the Siemens company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of Berlin and in 1929 he proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight to ten story high rise apartment towers for workers While Gropius was active at the Bauhaus Ludwig Mies van der Rohe led the modernist architectural movement in Berlin Inspired by the De Stijl movement in the Netherlands he build clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower He became the vice president of the German ‘’Werkbund’’ and became the head of the Bauhaus from 1930t to 1932 proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction His most famous modernist work was the German pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in Barcelona It was a work of pure modernism with glass and concrete walls and clean horizontal lines Though it was only a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 it became along with Le Corbusiers Villa Savoye one of bestknown landmarks of modernist architecture A reconstructed version now stands on the original site in Barcelona When the Nazis came to power in Germany they viewed the Bauhaus as a training ground for communists and closed the school in 1932 Gropius left Germany and went to England then to the United States where he and Marcel Breuer both joined the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Design and became the teachers of a generation of American postwar architects In 1937 Mies van der Rohe also moved to the United Stateshe became one of the most famous designers of postwar American skyscrapers German Expressionism 19191933 Foyer of the Großes Schauspielhaus or Great Theater in Berlin by Hans Poelzig 1919 The Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelsohn 1920–24 The Mossehaus in Berlin by Erich Mendelsohn an early example of streamline moderne 1921–23 The Chilehaus in Hamburg by Fritz Höger 1921–24 Horseshoeshaped public housing project by Bruno Taut 1925 The main building of Goethe University originally the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt designed by Hans Poelzig 1928–30 Second Goetheanum by Rudolf Steiner 1926 Columbushaus in Berlin by Erich Mendelsohn 1932 Expressionism which appeared in Germany between 1910 and 1925 was a countermovement against the strictly functional architecture of the Bauhaus and Werkbund Its advocates including Bruno Taut Hans Poelzig Fritz Hoger and Erich Mendelsohn wanted to create architecture that was poetic expressive and optimistic Many expressionist architects had fought in World War I and their experiences combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the German Revolution of 1919 resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid1920s As result many of the most innovative expressionist projects including Bruno Tauts Alpine Architecture and Hermann Finsterlins Formspiels remained on paper For lack of commissions some expressionist architects designed ephemeral exhibition buildings or designed sets and Scenography for theatre and films for the Erich Mendelsohn who disliked the term Expressionism for his work began his career designing churches silos and factories which were highly imaginative but for lack of resources were never built In 1920 he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of Potsdam an observatory and research center called the Einsteinium named in tribute to Albert Einstein It was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster His sculptural form very different from the austere rectangular forms of the Bauhaus first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores in Stuttgart Nuremberg and Berlin His Mossehaus in Berlin was an early model for the streamline moderne style His Columbushaus on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin 1931 was a prototype for the modernist office buildings that followed It was torn down in 1957 because it stood in the zone between East and West Berlin where the Berlin Wall was constructed Following the rise of the Nazis to power he moved to England 1933 then to the United States 1941 Fritz Höger was another notable Expressionist architect of the period His Chilehaus was built as the headquarters of a shipping company and was modeled after a giant steamship a triangual building with a sharply pointed bow It was constructed of dark brick and used external piers to express its vertical structure Its external decoration borrowed from Gothic cathedrals as did its internal arcades Hans Poelzig was another notable expressionist architect In 1919 he built the Großes Schauspielhaus an immense theater in Berlin seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario Max Reinhardt It featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome and lights on massive columns in its foyer He also constructed the IG Farben building a massive corporate headquarters now the main building of Goethe University in Frankfurt Bruno Taut specialized in building large scale apartment complexes for workingclass Berliners He built twelve thousand individual units sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes such as a giant horseshoe Unlike most other modernists he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life The use of dark brick in the German projects gave that particular style a name Brick Expressionism The Austrian philosopher architect and social critic Rudolf Steiner also departed as far as possible from traditional architectural forms His Second Goetheanum built from 1926 near Basel Switzerland the Einsteinturm in Potsdam Germany and the Second Goetheanum by Rudolf Steiner 1926 were based on no traditional models and had entirely original shapes Soviet Constructivism 19191930 Model of the Tower for the Third International by Vladimir Tatlin 1919 the Lenin Mausoleum in Moscow by Alexey Shchusev 1924 The USSR Pavilion at the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts by Konstantin Melnikov 1925 Rusakov Workers Club Moscow by Konstantin Melnikov 1928 Derzhprom the House of Industry Kharkiv by Sergey Serafimovich Samul Kravets and Marc Felger 1928 Main article Constructivist architecture After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian avantgarde artists and architects began searching for a new Soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism The new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period the futurism of poet Vladimir Mayakovskiy the Suprematism of painter Kasimir Malevich and the colorful Rayonism of painter Mikhail Larionov The most most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor Vladimir Tatlin for the Moscow meeting of the Third Communist International in 1920 he proposed two interlaced towers of metal four hundred meters high with four geometric volumes suspended from cables The movement of Russian Constructivist architecture was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by Aleksandr Rodchenko Their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the communist expression of material structures Soviet architects began to construct workers clubs communal apartment houses and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods One of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in Moscow was Konstantin Melnikovthe number of working clubs including Rusakov Workers Club 1928 and his own living house Melnikov House 1929 near Arbat Street in Moscow Melnikov traveled to Paris in 1925 where he built the Soviet Pavilion for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925 it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway and crowned with a hammer and sickle The leading group of constructivist architects led by Vesnin brothers and Moisei Ginzburg was publishing the Contemporary Architecture journal This group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the First Five Year Plan including colossal Dnieper Hydroelectric Station 1932 and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with Ginzburgs Narkomfin building A number of architects from the preSoviet period also took up the constructivist style The most famous example was Lenins Mausoleum in Moscow 1924 by Alexey Shchusev 1924 The main centers of constructivist architecture were Moscow and Leningrad however during the industrialization lots of constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities The regional industrial centers including Ekaterinburg Kharkiv or Ivanovo were rebuilt in the constructivist manner some cities like Magnitogorsk or Zaporizhia were constructed anew the socalled socgorod or socialist city The style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that Stalin favored Constructivist architects and even Le Corbusier projects for the new Palace of the Soviets from 1931 to 1933 but the winner was an early Stalinist building in the style termed Postconstructivism The last major Russian constructivist building by Boris Iofan was built for the Paris World Exhibition 1937 where it faced the pavilion of Nazi Germany by Hitlers architect Albert Speer Modernism becomes a movement the CIAM 1928 By the late 1920s modernism had become an important movement in Europe Architecture which previously had been predominantly national began to become international The architects traveled met each other and shared ideas Several modernists including Le Corbusier had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the League of Nations in 1927 In the same year the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the Weissenhof Estate Stuttgart Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twentyone houses Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe played a major part In 1927 Le Corbusier Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style The first meeting of the Congrès Internationaux dArchitecture Moderne or International Congresses of Modern Architects CIAM was held in a chateau on Lake Leman in Switzerland June 26–28 1928 Those attending included Le Corbusier Robert MalletStevens Auguste Perret Pierre Chareau and Tony Garnier from France Victor Bourgeois from Belgium Walter Gropius Erich Mendelsohn Ernst May and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from Germany Josef Frank from Austria Mart Stam and Gerrit Rietveld from the Netherlandsand Adolf Loos from Czechoslovakia A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend but they were unable to obtain visas Later members included Josep Lluís Sert of Spain and Alvar Aalto of Finland No one attended from the United States A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic Rational methods for groups of habitations A third meeting on The functional city was scheduled for Moscow in 1932 but was cancelled at the last minute Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens On board they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized The text called The Athens Charter after considerable editing by Corbusier and others was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939 but the meeting was cancelled because of the war The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II Art Deco Main article Art Deco Pavilion of the Galeries Lafayette Department Store at the Paris International Exposition of Decorative Arts 1925 The Grand Rex movie theater in Paris 1932 La Samaritaine department store by Henri Sauvage Paris 1925–28 The Art Deco architectural style called Style Moderne in France was modern but it was not modernist it had many features of modernism including the use of reinforced concrete glass steel chrome and it rejected traditional historical models such as the BeauxArts style and Neoclassicism but unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe it made lavish use of decoration and color It reveled in the symbols of modernity lightning flashes sunrises and zigzags Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States South America India China Australia and Japan In Europe Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters The style reached its peak in Europe at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925 which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries Only two pavilions were purely modernist the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier which represented his idea for a massproduced housing unit and the pavilion of the USSR by Konstantin Melnikov in a flamboyantly futurist style Later French landmarks in the Art Deco style included the Grand Rex movie theater in Paris La Samaritaine department store by Henri Sauvage 1926–28 and the Social and Economic Council building in Paris 1937–38 by Auguste Perret and the Palais de Tokyo and Palais de Chaillot both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne American Art Deco the skyscraper style 19191932 Main articles Art Deco and Streamline

Building also known as 570 Lexington Avenue by Cross Cross 1933 30 Rockefeller Center now the Comcast Building by Raymond Hood 1933 In the late 1920s and early 1930s an exuberant American variant of Art Deco appeared in the Chrysler Building Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center in New York Ciy The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neogothic or neoclassical style but these buildings were very different they combined modern materials and technology stainless steel concrete aluminum chromeplated steel with Art Deco geometry stylized zigzags lightning flashes fountains sunrises and at the top of the Chrysler building Art Deco gargoyles in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments The interiors of these new buildings sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids African textile patterns and European cathedrals Frank Lloyd Wright himself experimented with Mayan Revivalin the concrete cubebased Ennis House of 1924 in Los Angeles The style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major American cities The style was used most often in office buildings but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced The streamline style and Public Works Administration Architecture PanPacific Auditorium in Los Angeles 1936 The San Francisco Maritime Museum originally was a public bath house 1936 Intake towers of Hoover Dam 1931–36 Long Beach Main Post Office 1933–34 The beginning of the Great Depression in 1929 brought an end to lavishlydecorated Art Deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers It also brought in a new style called Streamline Moderne or sometimes just Streamline This style sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners featured rounded corners strong horizontal lines and often nautical features such as superstructures and steel railings It was associated with modernity and especially with transportation the style was often used for new airport terminals train and bus stations and for gas stations and diners built along the growing American highway system In the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings but in railroad locomotives and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners It both borrowed from industrial design and influenced it In the United States the Great Depression led to a new style for government buildings sometimes called PWA Moderne for the Public Works Administration which launched gigantic construction programs in the US to stimulate employment It was essentially classical architecture stripped of ornament and was employed in state and federal buildings from post offices to the largest office building in the world at that time Pentagon 1941–43 begun just before the United States entered the Second World War American modernism Frank Lloyd

Wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements He considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own Between 1916 and 1922 he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement this became known as his Mayan style after the pyramids of the ancient Mayan civilization He experimented for a time with modular massproduced housing He identified his architecture as Usonian a combination of USA utopian and organic social order His business was severely affected by the beginning of the Great Depression that began in 1929 he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment Between 1928 and 1935 he built only two buildings a hotel near Chandler Arizona and the most famous of all his residences Fallingwater 1934–37 a vacation house in Pennsylvania for Edgar J Kaufman Fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall perfectly uniting architecture and nature The German architect Rudolph Schindler also contributed to American modernism with his design for the Lovell beach house in Newport Beach The Austrian architect Richard Neutra moved to the United States in 1923 worked for short time with Frank Lloyd Wright also quickly became a force in American architecture through his modernist design for the same client the Lovell House in Los Angeles The Paris International Exposition of 1937 and the architecture of dictators The Palais de Chaillot by LouisHippolyte Boileau Jacques Carlu and Léon Azéma from the 1937 Paris International

by Giuseppe Terragni 19321936 The 1937 Paris International Exposition in Paris effectively marked the end of the Art Deco and of prewar architectural styles Most of the pavilions were in a neoclassical Deco style with colonnades and sculptural decoration The pavilions of Nazi Germany designed by Albert Speer in a German neoclassical style topped by eagle and swastika faced the pavilion of the Soviet Union topped by enormous statues of a worker and a peasant carrying a hammer and sickle As to the modernists Le Corbusier was practically but not quite invisible at the Exposition he participated in the Pavilion des temps nouveaux but focused mainly on his painting The one modernist who did attract attention was a collaborator of Le Corbusier Josep Lluis Sert the SpanishCatalan architect whose pavilion of the Second Spanish Republic was pure modernist glass and steel box Inside it displayed the most modernist work of the Exposition the painting Guernica by Pablo Picasso The original building was destroyed after the Exposition but it was recreated in 1992 in Barcelona The rise of nationalism in the 1930s was reflected in the Fascist architecture of Italy and Nazi architecture of Germany based on classical styles and designed to express power and grandeurThe Nazi architecture much of it designed by Albert Speer was intended to awe the spectators by its huge scale Adolf Hitler intended to turn Berlin into the capital of Europe more grand than Rome or Paris The Nazis closed the Bauhaus and the most prominent modern architects soon departed for Britain or the United States In Italy Benito Mussolini wished to present himself as the heir to the glory and empire of ancient Rome Mussolinis government was not as hostile to modernism as The Nazis the spirit of Italian Rationalism of the 1920s continued with the work of architect Giuseppe Terragni His Casa dl Fascio in Como headquarters of the local Fascist party was a perfectly modernist building with geometric proportions 332 meters long by 166 meters high a clean facade of marble and a Renaissanceinspired interior courtyard Opposed to Terragni was Marcello Piacitini a proponent of monumental fascist architecture who rebuilt the University of Rome and designed the Italian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition and planned a grand reconstruction of Rome on the fascist model The New York Worlds Fair 1939 The Trilon and Perisphere symbols of the 1939 Worlds Fair Pavilion of the Ford Motor Company in the Streamline Moderne style The RCA Pavilion featured the first public television broadcasts Living room of the House of Glass showing what future homes would look like The 1939 New York Worlds Fair marked a turning point in architecture between the Art Deco and modern architecture The theme of the Fair was the World of Tomorrow and its symbols were the purely geometric trilon and perisphere sculpture It monuments of Art Deco such as the Ford Pavilion in the Streamline Moderne but also included new International Style that would replace Art Deco as the dominant style after the War The Pavilions of Finland by Alvar Aalto of Sweden by Sven Markelius and of Brazil by Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa looked forward to a new style They became leaders in the postwar modernist movement World War II wartime innovation and postwar reconstruction 19391945 The center of Le Havre in winter 194344 destroyed by bombing The center of Le Havre as reconstructed by August Perret 19461964 Quonset hut en route to Japan 1945 World War II 1939–1945 and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology and in turn architectural possibilities The wartime industrial demands resulted in shortages of steel and other building materials leading to the adoption of new materials such as aluminum The war and postwar period brought greatly expanded use of prefabricated building largely for the military and government prefabricated building the semicircular metal Nissen hut of World War I revived as the Quonset hut The years immediately after the war saw the development of radical experimental houses including the enameledsteel Lustron house 1947–1950 and Buckminster Fullers experimental aluminum Dymaxion House The unprecedented destruction caused by the war was another factor in the rise of modern architecture Large parts of major cities from Berlin Tokyo and Dresden to Rotterdam and east London all the port cities of France particularly Le Havre Brest Marseille Cherbourg had been destroyed by bombing In the United States little civilian construction had been done since the 1920s housing was needed for millions of American soldiers returning from the war The postwar housing shortages in Europe and the United States led to the design and construction of enormous governmentfinanced housing projects usually in rundown center of American cities and in the suburbs of Paris and other European cities where land was available One of the largest reconstruction projects was that of the city center of Le Havre destroyed by the Germans and by Allied bombing in 1944 133 hectares of buildings in the center were flattened destroying 12500 buildings and leaving 40000 persons homeless The architect Auguste Perret a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete and prefabricated materials designed and built an entirely new center to the city with apartment blocks cultural commercial and government buildings He restored historic monuments when possible and built a new church St Joseph with a lighthouselike tower in the center to inspire hope His rebuilt city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005 Le Corbusier and the Cité Radieuse 194752 Exterior of the Unité dHabitation or Cité Radieuse in Marseille 1947–52 Salon and Terrace of an original unit of the Unité dHabitation now at the Cité de lArchitecture et du Patrimoine in Paris 1952 The Chapel of NotreDameduHaut in Ronchamp 19501955 Shortly after the War the French architect Le Corbusier who was nearly sixty years old and had not constructed a building in ten years was commissioned by the French government to construct a new apartment block in Marseille He called it Unité dHabitation in Marseille but it more popularly took the name of the Cité Radieuse after his book about futuristic urban planning Following his doctrines of design the building had a concrete frame raised up above the street on pylons it contained 337 duplex apartment units fit into the framework like pieces of a puzzle Each unit had two levels and a small terrace Interior streets had shops a nursery school and other serves and the flat terrace roof had a running track ventilation ducts and a small theater Le Corbusier designed furniture carpets and lamps to go with the building all purely functional the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents Unité dHabitation became a prototype for similar buildings in other cities both in France and Germany Combined with his equally radical organic design for the Chapel of NotreDame duHaut at Ronchamp this work propelled Corbusier in the first rank of postwar modern architects Postwar modernism in the United States 19451985 Main article International Style architecture The international Style of architecture had appeared in Europe in the late 1920s and in 1932 it was recognized and given a name In 1932 at an Exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City organized by architect Philip Johnson and architectural critic HenryRussell Hitchcock but it was overshadowed by Art Deco and neoclassical styles However due to the rise of Hitler and the Nazis in Germany between 1937 and 1941 most of the leaders of the German Bauhaus and New Objectivity movements found a new home in the United States Each in its own way the architects fleeing Germany redefined modern architecture and made it the dominant style in the United States Frank Lloyd Wright and the Guggenheim Museum The Pfeiffer Chapel at Florida Southern College by Frank Lloyd Wright 19411958 The tower of the Johnson Wax Headquarters and Research Center 1944–50 The Price Tower in Bartlesville Oklahoma 1956 Solomon Guggenheim Museum by Frank Lloyd Wright 19461959 Frank Lloyd Wright was eighty years old in 1947 he had been present at the beginning of American modernism and though he refused to accept that he belonged to any movement continued to play a leading role almost to its end One of his most original late projects was the campus of Florida Southern College in Lakeland Florida begun in 1941 and completed in 1943 He designed nine new buildings in a style that he described as The Child of the Sun He wrote that he wanted the campus to grow out of the ground and into the light a child of the sun He completed several notable projects in the 1940s including the Johnson Wax Headquarters and the Price Tower in Bartlesville Oklahoma 1956 The building is unusual that it is supported by its central core of four elevator shafts the rest of the building is cantilevered to this core like the branches of a tree Wright originally planned the structure for an apartment building in New York City That project was cancelled because of the Great Depression and he adapted the design for an oil pipeline and equipment company in Oklahoma He wrote that in New York City his building would have been lost in a forest of tall buildings but that in Oklahaoma it stood alone The design is asymmetrical each side is different In 1943 he was commissioned by the art collector Solomon R Guggenheim to design a museum for his collection of modern art His design was entirely original a bowlshaped building with a spiral ramp inside that led museum visitors on an upward tour of the art of the 20th century Work began in 1946 but it was not completed until 1959 the year that he died Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer Story Hall of the Harvard Graduate School of Design by Walter Gropius and The Architects Collaborative The Stillman House Litchfield Connecticut by Marcel Breuer 1950 The swimming pool mural is by Alexander Calder The PanAm building Now MetLife Building in New York by Walter Gropius and The Architects Collaborative 1958–63 Walter Gropius the founder of the Bauhaus moved to England in 1934 and spent there years there before being invited to the United States by Walter Hudnut of the Harvard Graduate School of Design Gropius became the head of the architecture faculty Marcel Breuer who had worked with him at the Bauhaus joined him and opened an office in Cambridge The fame of Gropius and Breuer attracted many students who themselves became famous architects including Ieoh Ming Pei and Philip Johnson They did not receive an important commission until 1941 when they designed housing for workers in Kensington Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh In 1945 Gropius and Breuer associated with a group of younger architects under the name TAC The Architects Collaborative Their notable works included the building of the Harvard Graduate School of Design the US Embassy in Athens 1956–57 and the headquarters of Pan American Airways in New York 1958–63 Mies van der Rohe Farnsworth House in Plano Illinois by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 1945–51 Lakeshore Drive Apartments Chicago 1948–51 Crown Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago 1956 The Seagram Building New York City 1958 by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Ludwig Mies van der Rohe described his architecture with the famous saying Less is more As the director of the school of architecture of what is now called the Illinois Institute of Technology from 1939 to 1956 Mies as he was commonly known made Chicago the leading city for American modernism in the postwar years He constructed new buildings for the Institute in modernist style two highrise apartment buildings on Lakeshore Drive 1948–51 which became models for highrises across the country Other major works included Farnsworth House in Plano Illinois 19451951 an simple horizontal glass box that had an enormous influence on American residential architecture the Chicago Convention Center 1952–54 and Crown Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology 1950–56 and The Seagram Building in New York City 1954–58 also set a new standard for purity and elegance Based on granite pillars the smooth glass and steel walls were given a touch of color by the use of bronzetoned Ibeams in the structure He returned to Germany in 196268 to build the new Nationalgallerie in Berlin His students and followers included Philip Johnsonand Eero Saarinen whose work was substantially influenced by his ideas Richard Neutra and Charles Eames Eames House by Charles and Ray Eames Pacific Palisades 1949 Neutra Office Building by Richard Neutra in Los Angeles 1950 The Constance Perkins House by Richard Neutra Los Angeles 1962 Influential residential architects in the new style in the United States included Richard Neutra and Charles and Ray Eames The most celebrated work of the Eames was Eames House in Pacific Palisades California 1949 Charles Eames in collaboration with Eero Saarinen It is composed of two structures an architects residence and his studio joined in the form of an L The house influenced by Japanese architecture is made of translucent and transparent panels organized in simple volumes often using natural materials supported on a steel framework The frame of the house was assembled in sixteen hours by five workmen He brightened up his buildings with panels of pure colors Richard Neutra continued to build influential houses in Los Angeles using the theme of the simple box Many of these houses erased the line distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces with walls of plate glass Neutras Constance Perkins House in Pasadena California 1962 was reexamination modest singlefamily dwelling It was built of inexpensive material wood plaster and glass completed at a cost of just under 18000 and was designed specifically to the physical dimensions of the owner she was a small woman so he scaled the house to her It features a reflecting pool which meanders under of the glass walls of the house Constance Perkins was a small woman so he scaled the house to her One of his most unusual buildings he designed was Shepherds Grove in Garden Grove California a drivein church where worshippers could follow the service in a parking lot adjoining the church without leaving their cars Skidmore Owings and Merrill and Wallace K Harrison Lever House by Skidmore Owings Merrill 1951–52 Manufacturers Trust Company Building by Skidmore Owings Merrill New York City 1954 Beinecke Library at Yale University by Skidmore Owings Merrill 1963 United Nations Headquarters in New York by Wallace Harrison with Oscar Niemeyer and Le Corbusier 1952 The Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center in New York City by Wallace Harrison 1966 Many of the notable modern buildings in the postwar years were produced by two architectural megaagencies which brought together large teams of designers for very complex projects The firm of Skidmore Owings Merrill was founded in Chicago in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel Owings and joined in 1939 by engineer John Merrill It soon went under the name of SOM Its first big project was Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge Tennessee the gigantic government installation that produced plutonium for the first nuclear weapons In 1964 the firm had eighteen partnerowners 54 associate participantsand 750 architects technicians designers decorators and landscape architects Their style was largely inspired by the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and their buildings soon had a large place in the New York skyline including the Lever House 195152 and the Manufacturers Trust Company Building 1954 Later buildings by the firm include Beinecke Library at Yale University 1963 the Willis Tower formerly Sears Tower in Chicago 1973 and One World Trade Center in New York Ciy 2013 which replaced the building destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11 2001 Wallace Harrison played a major part in the modern architectural history of New York as the architectural advisor of the Rockefeller Family he helped design Rockefeller Center the major Art Deco architectural project of the 1930s He was supervising architect for the 1939 New York Worlds Fair and with his partner Max Abramowitz was the builder and chief architect of the United Nations Building Harrison headed a committee of international architects which included Oscar Niemeyer who produced the original plan approved by the committee and Le Corbusier Other landmark New York buildings designed by Harrison and his firm included Metropolitan Opera House the master plan for Lincoln Center and John F Kennedy Airport Philip Johnson The Glass House by Philip Johnson in New Canaan Connecticut 1953 IDS Center in Minneapolis Minnesota by Philip Johnson 1969–72 The Crystal Cathedral by Philip Johnson 1977–80 PPG Place in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania by Philip Johnson 1981–84 Philip Johnson 19062005 was one of the youngest and last major figures in American modern architecture He trained at Harvard with Walter Gropius then was director of the department of architecture and modern design at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1946 to 1954 In 1947 he published a book about Mies van der Rohe and in 1953 designed his own residence the Glass House in New Canaan Connecticut in a style modeled after Miess Farnsworth House Beginning in 1955 he began to go in his own direction moving gradually toward expressionism with designs that increasingly departed from the orthodoxies of modern architecture His final and decisive break with modern architecture was the ATT Building later known as the Sony Tower and now the 550 Madison Avenue in New York City 1979 an essentially modernist skyscraper completely altered by the addition of curved cap at the top of a piece of chippendale furniture This building is generally considered to mark the beginning of Postmodern architecture in the United States Eero Saarinen The Gateway Arch in Saint Louis Missouri 19481965 Main building of the General Motors Technical Center 1949–55 The Ingalls Rink in New Haven Connecticut 1953–58 The TWA Terminal at JFK Airport in New York by Eero Saarinen 1956–62 Eero Saarinen 19101961 was the son of Eliel Saarinen the most famous Finnish architect of the Art Nouveau period who emigrated to the United States in 1923 when Eero was thirteen He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught and then at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas like the wings of birds In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St Louis Missouri in the form of a parabolic arch 192 meters high made of stainless steel 1948 He then designed the General Motors Technical Center in Warren Michigan 1949–55 a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown Virginia 1957–61 His next works were a major departure in style he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the Ingalls Rink in New Haven Connecticut 1956–59 an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables which served as a preliminary model for next and most famous work the TWA Terminal at JFK airport in New York 19561962 His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised and the other is attached to the center of the structure The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass All of the details inside the building including the benches counters escalators and clocks were designed in the same style Louis Kahn The First Unitarian Church of Rochester by Louis Kahn 1962 The Salk Institute by Louis Kahn 1962–63 Richards Medical Research Laboratories by Louis Kahn 1957–61 The Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth Texas 1966–72 TheNational Parliament Building in Dhaka Bangladesh 1962–74 Louis Kahn 1901–74 was another American architect who moved away from the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box and other dogmas of the prevailing international style He borrowed from a wide variety of styles and idioms including neoclassicism He was professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947–57 where his students included Eero Saarinen From 1957 until his death he was professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania HIs his work and ideas influenced Philip Johnson Minoru Yamasaki and Edward Durell Stone as they moved toward a more neoclassical style Unlike Mies he did not try to make his buildings look light he constructed mainly with concrete and brick and made his buildings look monumental and solid He drew from a wide variety of different sources the towers of Richards Medical Research Laboratories were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the American Academy in Rome in 1950 Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the First Unitarian Church of Rochester New York 1962 and the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth Texas 1966–72 Following the example of Le Corbusier and his design of the government buildings in Chandigarh the capital city of the Haryana Punjab State of India Kahn designed the Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban National Assembly Building in Dhaka Bangladesh 1962–74 when that country won independence from Pakistan It was Kahns last work Ieoh Ming Pei Green Building at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by IM Pei 1962–64 The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado by IM Pei 1963–67 Herbert F Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca New York by IM Pei 1973 East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC by I M Pei 1978 Pyramid of the Louvre Museum in Paris by IM Pei 1983–89 Ieoh Ming Pei 1917 was a major figure in late modernism and the debut of Postmodern architecture He was born in China and educated in the United States studying architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology While the architecture school there still trained in the BeauxArts architecture style Pei discovered the writings of Le Corbusier and a twoday visit by Le Corbusier to the campus in 1935 had a major impact on Peis ideas of architecture In the late 1930s he moved to the Harvard Graduate School of Design where he studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer and became deeply involved in Modernism After the War he worked on large projects for the New York real estate developer William Zeckendorf before breaking away and starting his own firm One of the first buildings his own firm designed was the Green Building at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology While the clean modernist facade was admired the building developed an unexpected problem it created a windtunnel effect and in strong winds the doors could not be opened Pei was forced to construct a tunnel so visitors could enter the building during high winds Between 1963 and 1967 Pei designed the Mesa Laboratory for the National Center for Atmospheric Research outside Boulder Colorado in an open area at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains The project differed from Peis earlier urban work it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains His design was a striking departure from traditional modernism it looked as if it were carved out of the side of the mountain In the late modernist area art museums bypassed skyscrapers as the most prestigious architectural projects they offered greater possibilities for innovation in form and more visibility Pei established himself with his design for the Herbert F Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca New York 1973 which was praised for its imaginative use of a small space and its respect for the landscape and other buildings around it This led to the commission for one of the most important museum projects of the period the new East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington completed in 1978 and to another of Peis most famous projects the pyramid at the entrance of Louvre Museum in Paris 1983–89 Pei chose the pyramid as the form that best harmonized with the Renaissance and neoclassical forms of the historic Louvre as well as for its associations with Napoleon and the Battle of the Pyramids Each face of the pyramid is supported by 128 beams of stainless steel supporting 675 panels of glass each 29 by 19 meters Postwar modernism in Europe 19451975 Sainte Marie de La Tourette in EvreauxsurlArbresle France by Le Corbusier 1956–60 Royal National Theatre London by Denys Lasdun 19671976 Auditorium of the

Fondation Maeght by Josep Lluis Sert 19591964 Church of St Martin Idstein Germany by Johannes Krahn 1965 In France Le Corbusier remained the most prominent architect though he built few buildings there His most prominent late work was the convent of Sainte Marie de La Tourette in EvreauxsurlArbresle The Convent built of raw concrete was austere and without ornament inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on his first trip to Italy In Britain the major figures in modenism included James Stirling 19261992 and Denys Lasdun 19142001 Lasduns bestknown work is the Royal National Theatre 19671976 on the south bank of the Thames Its raw concrete and blockish form offended British traditionalists Charles Prince of Wales Prince Charles compared it with a nuclear power station In Belgium a major figure was Charles Vandenhove born 1927 who constructed an important series of buildings for the University Hospital Center in Liege His later work ventured into colorful rethinking of historical styles such as Palladian architecture In Finland the most influential architect was Alvar Aalto who adapted his version of modernism to the Nordic landscape light and materials particularly the use of wood After World War II he taught architecture in the United States In Sweden Arne Jacobsen was the bestknown of the modernists who designed furniture as well as carefullyproportioned buildings In Italy the most prominent modernist was Gio Ponti who worked often with the structural engineer Pier Luigi Nervi a specialist in reinforced concrete Nervi created concrete beams of exceptional length twentyfive meters which allowed greater flexibility in forms and greater heights Their bestknown design was the Pirelli Building in Milan 19581960 which for decades was the tallest building in Italy The most famous Spanish modernist was the Catalan architect Josep Lluis Sert who worked with great success in Spain France and the United States In his early carer he worked for a time under Le Corbusier and designed the Spanish pavilion for the 1937 Paris Exposition His notable later work included the Fondation Maeght in SaintPauldeProvence France 1964 and the Harvard Science Center in Cambridge Massachusetts He served as Dean of Architecture at the Harvard School of Design Notable German modernists included Johannes Krahn who played an important part in rebuilding German cities after World War II and built several important museums and churches notably St Martin Idstein which artfully combined stone masonry concrete and glass Leading Austrian architects of the style included Gustav Peichl whose later works included the Art and Exhibition Center of the German Federal Republic in Bonn Germany 1989 Latin America Ministry of Health and Education in Rio de Janeiro by

of the Luis Barragán House and Studio in Mexico City by Luis Barragan 1948 Brazil became a showcase of modern architecture in the late 1930s through the work of Lucio Costa 19021998 and Oscar Niemeyer 19072012 Costa had the lead and Niemeyer collaborated on the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro 1936–43 and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 Worlds Fair in New York Following the war Neimeyer along with Le Corbusier conceived the form of the United Nations Headquarters constructed by Walter Harrison Lucio Costa also had overall responsibility for the plan of the most audacious modernist project in Brazil the creation of a new capital Brasilia constructed between 1956 and 1961 Costa made the general plan laid out in the form of a cross with the major government buildings in the center Niemeyer was responsible for designing the government buildings including the palace of the Presidentthe National Assembly composed of two towers for the two branches of the legislature and two meeting halls one with a cupola and other with an inverted cupola Niemeyer also built the cathedral eighteen ministries and giant blocks of housing each designed for three thousand residents each with its own school shops and chapel Following a military coup détat in Brazil in 1964 Niemeyer moved to France where he designed the modernist headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris 19651980 a miniature of his United Nations plan Mexico also had a prominent modernist movement Important figures included Felx Candela born in Spain who emigrated to Mexico in 1939 and participated in the construction of the new University of Mexico City he specialized in concrete structures in unusual parabolic forms Another important figure was Mario Pani who designed the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City 1949 and the Torre Insignia 1988 Augusto H Alvarez designed the Torre Latinamericano one of the early modernist skyscrapers in Mexico City 1956 it successfully withstood the 1985 Mexico City earthquake which destroyed many other buildings in the city center 1964 Pedro Ramirez Vasquez and Rafael Mijares designed the Olympic Stadium for the 1968 Olympics and Antoni Peyri and Candela designed the Palace of Sports Luis Barragan was another influential figure in Mexican modernism his raw concrete residence and studio in Mexico City looks like a blockhouse on the outside while inside it features great simplicity in form pure colors abundant natural light and one of is signatures a stairway without a railing He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1980 and the house was declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004 Asia and the Pacific House of Kunio Maekawa in Tokyo 1935 International House of Japan by Kunio Maekawa Tokyo 1955 Yoyogi National Gymnasium by Kenzo Tange 1964 Sydney Opera House in Sydney Australia by Jorn Utzon 1973 Japan like Europe had an enormous shortage of housing after the war due to the bombing of many cities 42 million housing units needed to be replaced Japanese architects combined both traditional and styles and techniques One of the foremost Japanese modernists was Kunio Maekawa 19051986 who had worked for Le Corbusiner in Paris until 1930 His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with Le Corbusier His notable buildings include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo all in the pure modernist style Kenzo Tange 19132005 worked in the studio of Kunio Maekawa from 1938 until 1945 before opening his own architectural firm His first major commission was the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum He designed many notable office buildings and cultural centers office buildings as well as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo The gymasim built of concrete features a roof suspended over the stadium on steel cables The Danish architect Jorn Utzon 1918 worked briefly with Alvar Aalto studied the work of Le Corbusier and traveled to the United States to meet Frank Lloyd Wright In 1957 he designed one of the most recognizable modernist buildings in the world the Sydney Opera House He is known for the sculptural qualities of his buildings and their relationship with the landscape The five concrete shells of the structure resemble seashells by the beach Begun in 1957 the project encountered considerable technical difficulties making the shells and getting the acoustics right Utzon resigned in 1966 and the opera house was not finished until 1973 ten years

1984–97 The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Bilbao Spain by Frank Gehry 19911997 The Fondation Cartier in Paris by Jean Nouvel 1991–94 Main articles Hightech architecture and Postmodern architecture Beginning in the late 1960s the international style was increasingly challenged by critics and architects who wanted architecture to have more imaginative and expressive forms not always strictly attached to function There was no single new style some new buildings were in a hightech style exploring new and original materials Others were neoclassical with elements of historic regional architectural styles and others were astonishing gigantic works of glass steel and concrete sculpture pushing to the limits the possibilities of building technology Very often new museums and concert halls were the most dramatic examples of the new styles Among the most striking examples of hightech architecture is the Centre Georges Pompidou the museum of modern art in Paris 19711977 A jury of distinguished architects including Philip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer reviewed 681 different proposals and chose one by two relativelyunknown architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers The museum resembles an enormous machine It in reality has two structures a reinforced concrete interior structure and on the exterior another structure of steel and glass where all the functional working of the buildings from air conditioning ducts to escalators are clearly visible Rogers followed the Pompidou Center with the Lloyds Building in Central London 1978–86 a twentystory office building which steel structure which resembles an industrial building assembled from a kit of metal and glass parts The British architect Norman Foster was another important innovator in hightech architecture His HSBC Building in Hong Kong a 78meter tall office tower was prefabricated in Britain in the form of fiv modules made of 30000 tons of steel and 4500 tons of alumnimum which were assembled like pieces from a kit in Hong Kong While it was hightech on form it also followed the traditional Chinese principles of Feng Shui The movement of postmodern architecture had the opposite goal from that of hightech architecture its intent was to bring back the traditions and decorative elements of past styles The term was first used by American architectural historian Charles Jencks in 1975 and then became the title of his 1977 book The Language of PostModern Architecture In his book he declared that modern architecture had died precisely at 332 in the afternoon of July 15 1972 when an aging complex of highrise public housing buildings in Saint Louis Missouri designed and built following the modernist precepts of Le Corbusier was dynamited and torn down He called for a return to eclecticism variety and ornament Another important advocate of postmodernism was Robert Venturi in his book Complexity and Contradition in Architecture 1966 and particularly in his book Learning from Las Vegas coauthored with Denise ScottBrown and Steven Izenour 1972 in which he celebrated the neon advertising signs and flamboyant casino architecture of Las Vegas Nevada He denied the principle of Mies van der Rohe that Less is More and called for a return to complexity and ornament Venturi created a variety of buildings to illustrate his ideas notably the Guild House in Philadelphia with subtle classical elements Philip Johnson who had first taken his inspiration from Le Corbusier also began to look beyond modernism for something new His ATT Building now 550 Madison Avenue in New York a modernist office tower with a neoclassical Chippendale pediment on top like a piece of 18th century furniture became an icon of postmodernism Charles Moore created the exuberant Piazza dItalia in New Orleans Louisiana a public square filled with recreated pieces of Italian renaissance architecture Other notable postmodernists included Michael Graves with his pioneering Portland Building in Portland Oregon and the Denver Public Library Several influential architects at the end of the 20th century are difficult to put into any one category or movement The notable endofcentury buildings of Richard Meier include the Getty Center in Los Angeles 19841997 where buildings of different shapes are united by their whitish stonefaced facades and broad panels of glass and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta 1980–83 The California architect Frank Gehry created the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao Spain 19911997 as an enormous work of stainless steel sculpture entirely detached from its environment and from any historical style His Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is also a vast work of metal sculpture resembling the sails of ship at sea Prominent architects in Europe at the end of the 20th century included Jean Nouvel in France noted for the Fondation Cartier and the Institut du Monde Arabe the Swiss architect Jacques Herzog who transformed the Bankside Power Station in London into the Tate Modern Gallery Preservation Several works or collections of modern architecture have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites In addition to the early experiments associated with Art Nouveau these include a number of the structures mentioned above in this article the Rietveld Schröder House in Utrecht the Bauhaus structures in Weimar and Dessau the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates the White City of Tel Aviv the city of Brasilia the Ciudad Universitaria of UNAM in Mexico City and the University City of Caracas in Venezuela and the Sydney Opera House Private organizations such as Docomomo International the World Monuments Fund and the Recent Past Preservation Network are working to safeguard and document imperiled Modern architecture In 2006 the World Monuments Fund launched Modernism at Risk an advocacy and conservation program Following the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina Modern structures in New Orleans have been increasingly slated for demolition Plans are underway to demolish many of the citys Modern public schools as well as large portions of the citys Civic Plaza Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA funds will contribute to razing the State Office Building and State Supreme Court Building both designed by the collaborating architectural firms of August Perez and Associates Goldstein Parham and Labouisse and Favrot Reed Mathes and Bergman
