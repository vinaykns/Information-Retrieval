 Sweet sorghum is any of the many varieties of the sorghum grass whose stalks have a high sugar content Sweet sorghum thrives better under drier and warmer conditions than many other crops and is grown primarily for forage silage and syrup production Although in most of the United States the term molasses refers to a sweet syrup made as a byproduct of sugarcane or sugar beet sugar extraction sweet sorghum syrup is known as sorghum molasses in some regions of the US Cultivation Sweet sorghum has been widely cultivated in the US since the 1850s for use in sweeteners primarily in the form of sorghum syrup By the early 1900s the US produced 20 million US gallons 76000 m of sweet sorghum syrup annually Making syrup from sorghum as from sugar cane is heavily laborintensive Following World War II with the declining availability of farm labor sorghum syrup production fell drastically Currently less than 1 million US gallons 3800 m are produced annually in the US In India it was introduced in early 1970s by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute Presently it is grown on large area as a fodder crop Most sorghum grown for syrup production is grown in Alabama Arkansas Georgia Iowa Kentucky Mississippi North Carolina and Tennessee Uses Sorghum syrup and hot biscuits are a traditional breakfast in the Southern United States Sorghum syrup is also used on pancakes cornmeal mush grits and other hot cereals It can be used as a cooking ingredient with a similar sweetening effect as molasses though blackstrap molasses still has a higher nutritional value than sorghum syrup in most regards In the US since the 1950s sorghum has been raised primarily for forage and silage with sorghum cultivation for cattle feed concentrated in the Great Plains Texas Kansas and Nebraska are the leading producers where insufficient rainfall and high temperature make corn production unprofitable Grain sorghum has also been used by the ethanol industry for quite some time because it yields about the same amount of ethanol per bushel as corn As newgeneration ethanol processes are studied and improved sorghums role may continue to expand Texas AM University ran trials to ascertain the best varieties for ethanol production from sorghum leaves and stalks in the USA In India and other places sweet sorghum stalks are used for producing biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into ethanol The crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions as it only extracts oneseventh of the water used by sugarcane A study by researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics ICRISAT found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food feed and fuel With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million ha in Asia and on 234 million ha in Africa a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact See also Camp Sorghum historical use of sorghum molasses References External links National Sweet Sorghum Producers and Processors Association Sweet Sorghum Ethanol Association SSEA List of Sweet Sorghum Renewable Energy Projects Report on smallscale sweet sorghum production and processing
