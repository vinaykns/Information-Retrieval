 Not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics Concentrated solar power also called concentrating solar power concentrated solar thermal and CSP systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight or solar thermal energy onto a small area Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat which drives a heat engine usually a steam turbine connected to an electrical power generator or powers a thermochemical reaction experimental as of 2013 Heat storage in molten salts allows some solar thermal plants to continue to generate after sunset and adds value to such systems when compared to photovoltaic panels CSP is being commercialized and the CSP market saw about 740 megawatt MW of generating capacity added between 2007 and the end of 2010 More than half of this about 478 MW was installed during 2010 bringing the global total to 1095 MW Spain added 400 MW in 2010 taking the global lead with a total of 632 MW while the US ended the year with 509 MW after adding 78 MW including two fossil–CSP hybrid plants The Middle East is also ramping up their plans to install CSP based projects ShamsI has been installed in Abu Dhabi by Masdar The largest CSP projects in the world is Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the United States which uses solar power tower technology and Mojave Solar Project which uses parabolic troughs As of January 2014 Spain had a total capacity of 2300 MW making this country the world leader in CSP United States follows with 1740 MW Interest is also notable in North Africa and the Middle East as well as India and China In Italy a handful of companies are trying to get authorization for 14 plants totalling 392 MW despite a strong local and political opposition The global market has been dominated by parabolictrough plants which account for 90 of CSP plants In most cases CSP technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics solar panels which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices of the panels and much smaller operating costs However the Chile Copiapó reached ¢63kWh In 2015 CSP represented less than 2 of worldwide installed capacity of solar electricity plants CSP is not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics CPV In CPV the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the photovoltaic effect History A legend has it that Archimedes used a burning glass to concentrate sunlight on the invading Roman fleet and repel them from Syracuse In 1973 a Greek scientist Dr Ioannis Sakkas curious about whether Archimedes could really have destroyed the Roman fleet in 212 BC lined up nearly 60 Greek sailors each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the suns rays and direct them at a tarcovered plywood silhouette 160 feet away The ship caught fire after a few minutes however historians continue to doubt the Archimedes story In 1866 Auguste Mouchout used a parabolic trough to producе steam for the first solar steam engine The first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the Italian Alessandro Battaglia in Genoa Italy in 1886 Over the following years invеntors such as John Ericsson and Frank Shuman developed concentrating solarpowered dеvices for irrigation refrigеration and locomоtion In 1913 Shuman finished a 55 HP parabolic solar thermal energy station in Maadi Egypt for irrigation The first solarpower system using a mirror dish was built by Dr RH Goddard who was already well known for his research on liquidfueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed Professor Giovanni Francia 1911–1980 designed and built the first concentratedsolar plant which entered into operation in SantIlario near Genoa Italy in 1968 This plant had the architecture of todays concentratedsolar plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors The plant was able to produce 1 MW with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500 °C The 10 MW Solar One power tower was developed in Southern California in 1981 but the parabolictrough technology of the nearby Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS begun in 1984 was more workable The 354 MW SEGS is still the largest solar power plant in the world and will remain so until the 390 MW Ivanpah power tower project reaches full power Current technology CSP is used to produce electricity sometimes called solar thermoelectricity usually generated through steam Concentratedsolar technology systems use mirrors or lenses with tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area The concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional power plant solar thermoelectricity The solar concentrators used in CSP systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling such as in solar air conditioning Concentrating technologies exist in five common forms namely parabolic trough enclosed trough dish Stirlings concentrating linear Fresnel reflector and solar power tower Although simple these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration For example the parabolictrough concentration gives about ⅓ of the theoretical maximum for the design acceptance angle that is for the same overall tolerances for the system Approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics Different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light New innovations in CSP technology are leading systems to become more and more costeffective Parabolic trough Main article Parabolic trough A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflectors focal line The receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid The reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis A working fluid eg molten salt is heated to 150–350 °C 300–660 °F as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system Trough systems are the most developed CSP technology The Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS plants in California the worlds first commercial parabolic trough plants Accionas Nevada Solar One near Boulder City Nevada and Andasol Europes first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative along with Plataforma Solar de Almerías SSPSDCS test facilities in Spain Enclosed trough The design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouselike glasshouse The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system Lightweight curved solarreflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires A singleaxis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes also suspended from the glasshouse structure Water is carried throughout the length of the pipe which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors GlassPoint Solar the company that created the Enclosed Trough design states its technology can produce heat for Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR for about 5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions compared to between 10 and 12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies Solar power tower Main article Solar power tower A solar power tower consists of an array of dualaxis tracking reflectors heliostats that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower the receiver contains a fluid deposit which can consist of sea water The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500–1000 °C 773–1273 K 932–1832 °F and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system An advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower Powertower development is less advanced than trough systems but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability The Solar Two in Daggett California and the CESA1 in Plataforma Solar de Almeria Almeria Spain are the most representative demonstration plants The Planta Solar 10 PS10 in Sanlucar la Mayor Spain is the first commercial utilityscale solar power tower in the world The 377 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility located in the Mojave Desert is the largest CSP facility in the world and uses three power towers Unfortunately Ivanpah generated only 0652 TWh 63 of its energy from solar means and the other 0388 TWh 37 was generated by burning Natural Gas The National Solar Thermal Test Facility NSTTF located in Albuquerque New Mexico is an experimental solar thermal test facility with a heliostat field capable of producing 6 MW Fresnel reflectors Main article Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector Fresnel reflectors are made of many thin flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped Flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space than a parabolic reflector thus capturing more of the available sunlight and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors Fresnel reflectors can be used in various size CSPs Dish Stirling Main article Dish Stirling A dish Stirling or dish engine system consists of a standalone parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflectors focal point The reflector tracks the Sun along two axes The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250–700 °C 480–1300 °F and then used by a Stirling engine to generate power Parabolicdish systems provide high solartoelectric efficiency between 31 and 32 and their modular nature provides scalability The Stirling Energy Systems SES United Sun Systems USS and Science Applications International Corporation SAIC dishes at UNLV and Australian National Universitys Big Dish in Canberra Australia are representative of this technology A world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 3125 by SES dishes at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility NSTTF in New Mexico on January 31 2008 a cold bright day According to its developer Ripasso Energy a Swedish firm in 2015 its Dish Sterling system being tested in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa showed 34 efficiency The SES installation in Maricopa Phoenix was the largest Stirling Dish power installation in the world until it was sold to United Sun Systems Subsequently larger parts of the installation have been moved to China as part of the huge energy demand Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery Main article Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery Heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump Solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump Deployment around the world Main articles List of solar thermal power stations and Solar power by country The commercial deployment of CSP plants started by 1984 in the US with the SEGS plants The last SEGS plant was completed in 1990 From 1991 to 2005 no CSP plants were built anywhere in the world Global installed CSPcapacity has increased nearly tenfold since 2004 and grew at an average of 50 percent per year during the last five years In 2013 worldwide installed capacity increased by 36 percent or nearly 09 gigawatt GW to more than 34 GW Spain and the United States remained the global leaders while the number of countries with installed CSP were growing There is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation CSP is also increasingly competing with the cheaper photovoltaic solar power and with concentrator photovoltaics CPV a fastgrowing technology that just like CSP is suited best for regions of high solar insolation In addition a novel solar CPVCSP hybrid system has been proposed recently Efficiency The conversion efficiency η displaystyle eta of the incident solar radiation into mechanical work − without considering the ultimate conversion step into electricity by a power generator − depends on the thermal radiation properties of the solar receiver and on the heat engine eg steam turbine Solar irradiation is first converted into heat by the solar receiver with the efficiency η R e c e i v e r displaystyle eta Receiver and subsequently the heat is converted into work by the heat engine with the efficiency η C a r n o t displaystyle eta Carnot using Carnots principle For a solar receiver providing a heat source at temperature T H displaystyle TH and a heat sink at room temperature T 0 displaystyle T0 the overall conversion efficiency can be calculated as follows For a solar flux I

area A displaystyle A and an absorptivity α displaystyle alpha For simplicitys sake one can assume that the losses are only radiative ones a fair assumption for high temperatures thus for a reradiating area A and an emissivity ϵ displaystyle epsilon applying the StefanBoltzmann law yields Simplifying these equations by considering perfect optics η O p t i c s displaystyle eta mathrm Optics 1 collecting and reradiating areas equal and maximum absorptivity and emissivity α displaystyle alpha 1 ϵ displaystyle epsilon 1 then substituting in the first equation gives The graph shows that the overall efficiency does not increase steadily with the receivers temperature Although the heat engines efficiency Carnot increases with higher temperature the receivers efficiency does not On the contrary the receivers efficiency is decreasing as the amount of energy it cannot absorb Qlost grows by the fourth power as a function of temperature Hence there is a maximum reachable temperature When the receiver efficiency is null blue curve on the figure below Tmax is T m a x I C σ 025 displaystyle Tmathrm max leftfrac ICsigma right025 There is a temperature Topt for which the efficiency is maximum ie when the efficiency derivative relative to the receiver temperature is null Consequently this leads us to the following equation Solving this equation numerically allows us to obtain the optimum process temperature according to the solar concentration ratio C displaystyle C red curve on the figure below Theoretical efficiencies aside realworld experience of CSP reveals a 25–60 percent shortfall in projected production A pilot 5 megawatt CSP power tower Solar One was converted to a 10 megawatt CSP power tower Solar Two decommissioned in 1999 Due to the success of Solar Two a commercial power plant called Solar Tres Power Tower was built in Spain renamed Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant Gemasolars results have paved the way for the Crescent Dunes project Ivanpah difficulties arise also from not having considered the lessons about the benefits of thermal storage Solana in Arizona is at 25 percent below projected numbers Ivanpah in California is at 40 percent below projected numbers A slightly bigger photovoltaic power station like the 290 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project peaked at most to 741 GW·h in 2014 comparing with the 280 MW Solana growing 719 GW·h Another operator that of the 280 MW Genesis Solar projected only 580 GW·h production and instead made 621 GW·h in 2015 CSP was once thought to be economically superior to photovoltaics up to 2015 it has proven not to be the case Recent PV commercial power is selling for ⅓ recent CSP contracts Costs As of 9 September 2009 the cost of building a CSP station was typically about US250 to 4 per watt while the fuel the suns radiation is free Thus a 250 MW CSP station would have cost 600–1000 million to build That works out to 012 to 018 USDkWh New CSP stations may be economically competitive with fossil fuels Nathaniel Bullard a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance has calculated that the cost of electricity at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility a project under construction in Southern California will be lower than that from photovoltaic power and about the same as that from natural gas However in November 2011 Google announced that they would not invest further in CSP projects due to the rapid price decline of photovoltaics Google invested US168 million on BrightSource IRENA has published on June 2012 a series of studies titled Renewable Energy Cost Analysis The CSP study shows the cost of both building and operation of CSP plants Costs are expected to decrease but there are insufficient installations to clearly establish the learning curve As of March 2012 there were 19 GW of CSP installed with 18 GW of that being parabolic trough At the 2017 Chile auction SolarReserve bid 63MWh ¢63kWh for 24hour CSP power with no subsidies competing with other types such as LNG gas turbines Incentives Spain Solarthermal electricity generation is eligible for feedin tariff payments art 2 RD 6612007 if the system capacity does not exceed the following limits Systems registered in the register of systems prior to 29 September 2008 500 MW for solarthermal systems Systems registered after 29 September 2008 PV only The capacity limits for the different system types are redefined during the review of the application conditions every quarter art 5 RD 15782008 Annex III RD 15782008 Prior to the end of an application period the market caps specified for each system type are published on the website of the Ministry of Industry Tourism and Trade art 5 RD 15782008 Since 27 January 2012 Spain has halted acceptance of new projects for the feedintariff Projects currently accepted are not affected except that a 6 tax on feedintariffs has been adopted effectively reducing the feedintariff Australia See also Energy policy of Australia At the federal level under the Largescale Renewable Energy Target LRET in operation under the Renewable Energy Electricity Act 2000 large scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited RET power stations may be entitled to create largescale generation certificates LGCs These certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities usually electricity retailers to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme However as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation it tends to favour more established RE technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation such as large scale onshore wind rather than solar thermal and CSP At State level renewable energy feedin laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kWp and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar PV photovoltaic generation This means that larger scale CSP projects would not be eligible for payment for feedin incentives in many of the State and Territory jurisdictions Future A study done by Greenpeace International the European Solar Thermal Electricity Association and the International Energy Agencys SolarPACES group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power The study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25 of the worlds energy needs by 2050 The increase in investment would be from 2 billion euros worldwide to 925 billion euros in that time period Spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology with more than 50 governmentapproved projects in the works Also it exports its technology further increasing the technologys stake in energy worldwide Because the technology works best with areas of high insolation solar radiation experts predict the biggest growth in places like Africa Mexico and the southwest United States It indicates that the thermal storage systems based in nitrates calcium potassium sodium will make the CSP plants more and more profitable The study examined three different outcomes for this technology no increases in CSP technology investment continuing as it has been in Spain and the US and finally the true potential of CSP without any barriers on its growth The findings of the third part are shown in the table below Finally the study acknowledged how technology for CSP was improving and how this would result in a drastic price decrease by 2050 It predicted a drop from the current range of €023–015kwh to €014–010kwh Recently the EU has begun to look into developing a €400 billion 774 billion network of solar power plants based in the Sahara region using CSP technology known as Desertec to create a new carbonfree network linking Europe the Middle East and North Africa The plan is backed mainly by German industrialists and predicts production of 15 of Europes power by 2050 Morocco is a major partner in Desertec and as it has barely 1 of the electricity consumption of the EU it will produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to Europe Algeria has the biggest area of desert and private Algerian firm Cevital has signed up for Desertec With its wide desert the highest CSP potential in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions about 170 TWhyear and its strategic geographical location near Europe Algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of Desertec project Moreover with the abundant naturalgas reserve in the Algerian desert this will strengthen the technical potential of Algeria in acquiring SolarGas Hybrid Power Plants for 24hour electricity generation Other organizations expect CSP to cost 006USkWh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment That would make CSP as cheap as conventional power Investors such as venture capitalist Vinod Khosla expect CSP to continuously reduce costs and actually be cheaper than coal power after 2015 In 2009 scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL and SkyFuel teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30 less expensive than todays best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glassbased models with a silver polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors but at much lower cost and weight It also is much easier to deploy and install The glossy film uses several layers of polymers with an inner layer of pure silver Telescope designer Roger Angel Univ of Arizona has turned his attention to CPV and is a partner in a company called Rehnu Angel utilizes a spherical concentrating lens with largetelescope technologies but much cheaper materials and mechanisms to create efficient systems Recent experience with CSP technology in 2014 2015 at Solana in Arizona and Ivanpah in Nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25 and 40 percent Producers blame clouds and stormy weather but critics seem to think there are technological issues These problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity and threaten the longterm viability of the technology As photovoltaic costs continue to plummet many think CSP has a limited future in utilityscale electricity production Very large scale solar power plants There are several proposals for gigawatt size very large scale solar power plants They include the EuroMediterranean Desertec proposal and Project Helios in Greece 10 gigawatt both now canceled A 2003 study concluded that the world could generate 2357840 TWh each year from very large scale solar power plants using 1 of each of the worlds deserts Total consumption worldwide was 15223 TWhyear in 2003 The gigawatt size projects are arrays of single plants The largest single plant in operation is the 370 MW Ivanpah Solar In 2012 the BLM made available 97921069 acres 39627251 hectares of land in the southwestern United States for solar projects enough for between 10000 and 20000 gigawatts GW Effect on wildlife It has been noted that insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed burned if the birds fly near the point where light is being focused This can also affect raptors who hunt the birds Federal wildlife officials have begun calling these power towers mega traps for wildlife According to rigorous reporting in over six months actually only 133 singed birds were counted By focusing no more than four mirrors on any one place in the air during standby at Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project in three months the death rate dropped to zero See also Renewable energy portal Energy portal Clean Technology Fund Concentrated photovoltaics CPV Copper in concentrating
