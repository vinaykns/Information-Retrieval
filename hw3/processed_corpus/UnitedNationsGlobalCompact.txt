 The United Nations Global Compact is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies and to report on their implementation The UN Global Compact is a principlebased framework for businesses stating ten principles in the areas of human rights labour the environment and anticorruption Under the Global Compact companies are brought together with UN agencies labour groups and civil society Cities can join the Global Compact through the Cities Programme The UN Global Compact is the worlds largest corporate sustainability aka corporate social responsibility initiative with 13000 corporate participants and other stakeholders over 170 countries with two objectives Mainstream the ten principles in business activities around the world and Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals such as the Millennium Development Goals MDGs and Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Moving forward The UN Global Compact and its signatories are deeply invested and enthusiastic about supporting work towards the SDGs The UN Global Compact was announced by then UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan in an address to the World Economic Forum on January 31 1999 and was officially launched at UN Headquarters in New York on July 26 2000The Global Compact Office works off of a mandate set out by the UN General Assembly as an organization that promotes responsible business practices and UN values among the global business community and the UN System The UN Global Compact is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges SSE initiative along with the Principles for Responsible Investment PRI the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative UNEPFI and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD The Ten Principles The UN Global Compact was initially launched with nine Principles On June 24 2004 during the first Global Compact Leaders Summit Kofi Annan announced the addition of the tenth principle against corruption in accordance with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption adopted in 2003 Human Rights Businesses should Principle 1 Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and Principle 2 Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Labour Standards Businesses should uphold Principle 3 the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5 the effective abolition of child labour and Principle 6 the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation Environment Businesses should Principle 7 support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote environmental responsibility and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies AntiCorruption Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery Facilitation The UN Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument but rather a forum for discussion and a network for communication including governments companies and labour organisations whose actions it seeks to influence and civil society organizations representing its stakeholders The UN Global Compact says that once companies declared their support for the principles This does not mean that the Global Compact recognizes or certifies that these companies have fulfilled the Compact’s principles Instead as mentioned in a 2015 interview with Executive Director Lise Kingo we are the guide dogs not the watchdogs with the organization seeking to prioritize providing resources and support instead of attempting to enforce discipline The UN Global Compacts goals are intentionally flexible and vague but it distinguishes the following channels through which it provides facilitation and encourages dialogue policy dialogues learning local networks and projects Given recent climate talks and summits the UN Global Compact stands to play a critical role in helping signatories and governments work in part to achieve the SDGs Recent studies indicate that businesses are more open than ever to private sector interventions such as carbon pricing and other mechanics to help curb climate effects within the scope of business solutions The Global Compact also will periodically create resources and guides that business and non profit organizations may use in their efforts to support the Compacts overall mission One such example is the SDG Compass developed in collaboration with the Global Reporting Initiative GRI and World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBSCD which is a collection of resources analysis of the goals indicators for businesses tools for stakeholders that companies can utilize in finding out their role in helping to achieve the SDGs History The first Global Compact Leaders Summit chaired by the then SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan was held in UN Headquarters in New York on June 24 2004 to bring intensified international focus and increased momentum to the UN Global Compact The second Global Compact Leaders Summit chaired by SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon was held on 5–6 July 2007 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva Switzerland It adopted the Geneva Declaration on corporate responsibility Marking the 10th anniversary of the Global Compacts launch the Global Compact Leaders Summit 2010 took place on 24–25 June 2010 in New York On the occasion the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership identifying leadership criteria linked to implementation of the ten principles efforts to support development objectives and engagement in the Global Compact was released In 2009 Rotary International partnered with the UN Global Compact This was a very friendly partnership since Rotary International played a role in the chartering of the United Nations Since its creation in 2000 the Global Compact has been primarily focused on helping support and achieve the Millennium Development Goals however after those expired in 2015 their top priority has been updated to the pursuit and progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the SDGs accompanying 2030 deadlines UN Global Compact – Cities Programme In 2001 the City of Melbourne proposed that cities as well as corporations should be allowed to join the UN Global Compact arguing that this would provide a clear statement of a citys commitment to positive change as well as motivating participation in international dialogue The proposal was accepted and the UN Global Compact Cities Programme was launched in 2002 It was formed as an urbanfocused component of the Global Compact with its International Secretariat initially located in Melbourne Australia The aim of the programme is to improve urban life in cities throughout the world Melbourne became the first city to engage the Global Compact in June 2001 There are as of 2016 over 130 member cities in the programme In April 2003 under the directorship of David Teller a framework called the Melbourne Model was developed that went beyond the Ten Principles It begins by drawing the resources of government business and civil society into a crosssector partnership in order to develop a practical project that addresses a seemingly intractable urban issue In 2007 the then Director Paul James 2007–2014 and his colleagues Dr Andy Scerri and Dr Liam Magee took this methodology further by integrating the partnership model with a fourdomain sustainability framework called Circles of Sustainability In 2007 the Secretariat moved from the Committee For Melbourne to the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University itself affiliated with UNHABITAT There projects associated with citybased responses to global climate change and globalization became increasingly important The Melbourne Model was further elaborated with a sustainability indicators program developed as a way of assessing and monitoring progress In 2012 the Circles of Sustainability method was elaborated to guide a city or urban region through a rigorous assessment process As one of the outcomes it provides a figurative image of the overall sustainability of that city to illustrate its strengths and weaknesses In 2015 RMIT Professor Ralph Horne became the third director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme and in February 2016 an Urban Thinkers Campus was organised at RMIT Melbourne in collaboration with World Vision International as part of the buildup to UN Habitat III The theme of the Urban Thinkers Campus was Ethical Cities Locking in Liveability This was followed by the organisation of a Urban Innovation Forum on Ethical Cities in July 2016 in Barcelona Spain as a collaboration between the UN Global Compact Cities Programme RMIT Europe and UNHabitat Local networks Local networks of the Global Compact advance the initiative and its ten principles at a country level Currently there are approximately 85 Local Networks in total These networks help companies and non profit organizations understand what responsible business means within diverse national cultural and linguistic contexts Additionally there are related programs for particular topics of interest such as the Business for Peace initiative that bring awareness to businesses and other organizations about instability and conflict such that organizations can help to address these concerns from their own perspective and with the assistance of their local networks Local connections to supplement the international connections made by the Global Compact at large can help to broaden the engagement and impact of members Local Networks are independent selfgoverned and self managed entities and work closely with the UN Global Compacts New York headquarters and coordinate as points of contact for UN Global Compact signatories in their respective countries The Local Networks of the Global Compact are showcased but not limited to the interactions chronicled below In Australia The Global Compact Local Network in Australia was established in 2009 by a steering committee drawn from the Australian business community and stakeholder groups It was formally incorporated in 2011 as the Global Compact Network Australia Limited and elections were held for the inaugural board of directors In 2011 it established two businessled leadership groups dealing with human rights and anticorruption The GCNA draws its funding directly from members and memberbased activities in contrast to many networks who rely in part on government funding In Bulgaria The Global Compact Local Network in Bulgaria was founded in January 2003 under the auspices of President Georgi Parvanov The voluntary initiative unites 120 Bulgarian companies nongovernmental organizations and academia into a unique network All members are united around the idea to apply the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in their daily practices and to be responsible corporate citizensIn 2006 to strengthen and enhance the role of the initiative a management structure was introduced consisting of Advisory Board and a Secretariat For the period 20062010 the network activities were supported by the United Nations Development Program Bulgaria With the active participation and financial contribution of its members Global Compact Bulgaria organized numerous initiatives related to environment health education and youth Among them are the projects Unleashing Entrepreneurship Love Bridge Sharing Best Practices in Corporate Social Responsibility With the end of the support from UNDP Bulgaria the Global Compact Local Network in Bulgaria had to identify and formulate a new strategy for sustainability So between 2009 and 2010 the members signed an institutional framework for future organizational development As a result on 10 September 2010 a new independent organization was founded – Association Global Compact Network Bulgaria Its members are 20 leading companies and organizations in Bulgaria members the UN Global Compact as well The Association is managed by a Steering Committee and Control Committee Their main goals are to learn from each other to communicate to generate an advocacy impact and initiate dialogue or partnerships with other actors such as the government local authorities labour organisations and civil society organizations In France The Global Compact Network France was established in 2004 It is the second largest local network of the UN Global Compact after Spain with 873 members in January 2013 The main aim of the Global Compact Network France is to add personalized value to the

realising the vision of sustainable development in India At present Sudhir Vasudeva CMD ONGC is the President of the Global Compact Network India for the term 201113 and is managed by a Governing Council Global Compact Network In Syria The Syria initiative aims at enhancing civic engagement and corporate social responsibility of private sector by promoting the ten principles of the UN Global

the private sector towards improving gender equality Echoing the sentiments of initiatives such as the HeforShe and the large support of individuals in the region for promoting gender equality and empowering women Much of this progress is being achieved by practical guidelines for how private entities can make a more diverse inclusive workplace that create codes of global business In Spain The

SMEs the public sector educational entities and nongovernmental organizations NGOs In order to abide by the rules of Spanish legislature the general assembly holds a vote each year on budgetary issues and resolutions and nominates the Steering CommitteeThe Global Compact Network Spain has been successful in involving SMEs developing interactive resources and reporting tools and emphasizing human rights through the commitment of the local companies Criticism Some critics believe that without any effective monitoring and enforcement provisions the Global Compact fails to hold corporations accountable Moreover these critics argue that companies could potentially misuse the Global Compact as a public relations instrument for bluewash Bluewashing refers to the alleged practice of companies claiming their membership or participation in philanthropic and charity based activity as an excuse and perhaps as an entry door to increase corporate influence upon international organizations An informal network previously known as Global Compact Critics leveled a variety of criticisms at the Global Compact citing a lack of mechanisms for sanctioning non compliance or lack of progress The Global Compact critics formally disbanded in February 2015 recommending that interested parties consult the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations SOMO website Similarly the Alliance for a CorporateFree UN which also no longer exists was a campaigning organization of several international NGOs led by Corpwatch which highlighted weaknesses in the principles underlying the Global Compact The Global Compact was criticized by Maude Barlow senior adviser on water issues to the President of the United Nations General Assembly in December 2008 accused the Global Compact of bluewashing David Andrews senior adviser on Food Policy and Sustainable Development and Peter Utting deputy director of UNRISD Leaders of the tribe Ayoreo Indians in Paraguay wrote to the UN Global Compact saying they are concerned and frustrated by the inclusion in it of a controversial Brazilian ranching company The company Yaguarete Porá was charged and fined for illegally clearing the Ayoreos forests and concealing evidence of uncontacted Ayoreo living there The Ayoreo asked that it be expelled from the Global Compact Support The Global Compact provides a list of its 12000 participant organizations composed of roughly 8000 businesses and 4000 nonbusiness entities on its website The site provides a brief overview of each participant and a link to their Letter of Commitment if new Financial Overview and Contributions if applicable and Communication on Progress COP Notable companies who have signed on the Global Compact include but are not limited to Starbucks LOreal Bayer AG CocaCola 3M and Deloitte In addition to its signatories the Global compact has been repeatedly supported by the UN General Assembly honoring its 15th anniversary in June 2015 alongside the Secretary General Ban KiMoon himself who claims that Business can be a global force for good and that advocacy and example can drive action to achieve a life of dignity for all people See also
