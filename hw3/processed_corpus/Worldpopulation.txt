 In demographics the world population is the total number of humans currently living As of August 2016 it was estimated at 74 billion The United Nations estimates it will further increase to 112 billion in the year 2100 World population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine of 1315–17 and the Black Death in 1350 when it was near 370 million The highest population growth rates – global population increases above 18 per year – occurred between 19551975 peaking to 206 between 19651970 The growth rate has declined to 118 between 20102015 and is projected to decline to 013 by the year 2100 Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 135 million while deaths number 56 million per year and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040 World population reached 7 billion on October 31 2011 according to the United Nations Population Fund and on March 12 2012 according to the United States Census Bureau The median age of the worlds population was estimated to be 301 years in 2016 with the male median age estimated to be 294 years and female 309 years The 2012 UN projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate the global population is expected to reach between 83 and 109 billion by 2050 2003 UN Population Division population projections for the year 2150 range between 32 and 248 billion One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 93 and 126 billion in 2100 and continued growth thereafter Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth highlighting the growing pressures on the environment global food supplies and energy resources Estimates on the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of 106 to 108 billion Population by region Six of the Earths seven continents are permanently inhabited on a large scale Asia is the most populous continent with its 43 billion inhabitants accounting for 60 of the world population The worlds two most populated countries alone China and India together constitute about 37 of the worlds population Africa is the second most populated continent with around 1 billion people or 15 of the worlds population Europes 733 million people make up 12 of the worlds population as of 2012 while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 600 million 9 Northern America primarily consisting of the United States Mexico and Canada has a population of around 352 million 5 and Oceania the leastpopulated region has about 35 million inhabitants 05 Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population Antarctica has a small fluctuating international population based mainly in polar science stations This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter as visiting researchers return to their home countries Population by continent History See also World population estimates and History of the world Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity possible only since the Age of Discovery Early estimates for the population of the world date to the 17th century William Petty in 1682 estimated world population at 320 million modern estimates ranging close to twice this number by the late 18th century estimates ranged close to one billion consistent with modern estimates More refined estimates broken down by continents were published in the first half of the 19th century at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s Antiquity and Middle Ages Main articles Classical demography and Medieval demography Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10000 BCE have ranged between 1 million and 15 million Even earlier genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1000 and 10000 people about 70000 BCE according to the Toba catastrophe theory By contrast it is estimated that around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century CE The Plague of Justinian which first emerged during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian caused Europes population to drop by around 50 between the 6th and 8th centuries CE The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340 The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the worlds population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400 it took 200 years for population figures to recover The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393 presumably due to a combination of Mongol invasions famine and plague Starting in 2 AD the Han Dynasty of ancient China kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household In the year 2 AD the population of Western Han was recorded as 57671400 individuals in 12366470 households decreasing to 47566772 individuals in 9348227 households by 146 AD towards the End of the Han Dynasty At the founding of the Ming Dynasty in 1368 Chinas population was reported to be close to 60 million toward the end of the dynasty in 1644 it may have approached 150 million Englands population reached an estimated 56 million in 1650 up from an estimated 26 million in 1500 New crops that were brought to Asia and Europe from the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth Since their introduction to Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century maize and cassava have similarly replaced traditional African crops as the most important staple food crops grown on the continent Around 300 BCE the population of India was between 100 million and 140 million The population of India in 1600 was around 100 million Hence from 300 BCE to 1600 CE Indias population was more or less stable The preColumbian North American population probably numbered somewhere between 2 million and 18 million Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence According to the most extreme scholarly claims as many as 90 of the Native American population of the New World died due to Old World diseases such as smallpox measles and influenza Over the centuries the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity Modern era During the European Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions the life expectancy of children increased dramatically The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 745 in 1730–1749 to 318 in 1810–1829 Between 1700 and 1900 Europe’s population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million Altogether the areas populated by people of European descent comprised 36 of the worlds population in 1900 Population growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of vaccination and other improvements in medicine and sanitation Improved material conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century The population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006 The United States saw its population grow from around 53 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920 exceeding 307 million in 2010 The first half of the 20th century in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of major wars famines and other disasters which caused largescale population losses approximately 60 million excess deaths After the collapse of the Soviet Union Russias population declined significantly – from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012 – but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted Many countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century due to economic development and improvements in public health Chinas population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953 and now stands at over 13 billion The population of the Indian subcontinent which was about 125 million in 1750 increased to 389 million in 1941 today India Pakistan and Bangladesh are collectively home to about 163 billion people Java had about 5 million inhabitants in 1815 its presentday successor Indonesia now has a population of over 140 million Mexicos population grew from 136 million in 1900 to about 112 million in 2010 Between the 1920s and 2000s Kenyas population grew from 29 million to 37 million Milestones by the billions Main article World population milestones It is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804 It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927 but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960 Thereafter the global population reached four billion in 1974 five billion in 1987 six billion in 1999 and according to the United States Census Bureau seven billion in March 2012 The United Nations however estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011 According to current projections the global population will reach eight billion by 2024 and will likely reach around nine billion by 2037 Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 74 billion to a high of more than 106 billion Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations especially the fertility variable Longrange predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 32 billion in the low scenario to high scenarios of 248 billion One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150 assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 304 children per woman however by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 252 There is no estimation for the exact day or month the worlds population surpassed one or two billion The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively The United Nations did determine and celebrate the Day of 5 Billion on July 11 1987 and the Day of 6 Billion on October 12 1999 The Population Division of the United Nations declared the Day of 7 Billion to be October 31 2011 Global demographics Main article Demographics of the world As of 2012 the global sex ratio is approximately 101 males to 1 female The greater number of men is possibly due to the significant gender imbalances evident in the Indian and Chinese populations Approximately 263 of the global population is aged under 15 while 659 is aged 15–64 and 79 is aged 65 or over The median age of the worlds population was estimated to be 297 years in 2014 and is expected to rise to 379 years by 2050 According to the World Health Organization the global average life expectancy is 705 years as of 2012 with women living an average of 73 years and men approximately 68 years In 2010 the global fertility rate was estimated at 252 children per woman In June 2012 British researchers calculated the total weight of Earths human population as approximately 287 million tonnes with the average person weighing around 62 kilograms 137 lb The CIA estimated nominal 2013 gross world product at US7431 trillion giving an annual global per capita figure of around US10500 Around 129 billion people 184 of the world population live in extreme poverty subsisting on less than US125 per day approximately 870 million people 1225 are undernourished 83 of the worlds over15s are considered literate In June 2014 there were around 303 billion global Internet users constituting 423 of the world population The Han Chinese are the worlds largest single ethnic group constituting over 19 of the global population in 2011 The worlds mostspoken first languages are Mandarin Chinese spoken by 1244 of the worlds population Spanish 485 English 483 Arabic 325 and Hindustani 268 The worlds largest religion is Christianity whose adherents account for 3335 of the global population Islam is the secondlargest religion accounting for 2243 and Hinduism the third accounting for 1378 In 2005 around 16 of the global population were reported to be nonreligious Largest populations by country Further information List of countries by population Approximately 43 billion people live in these ten countries representing around 58 of the worlds population as of March 2016 Approximately 37 billion people or half of the world population live in the six most populous countries Most densely populated countries Further information List of countries and dependencies by population density The tables below list the worlds most densely populated countries both in absolute terms and in comparison to their total populations Fluctuation Main article Population growth Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions Nonetheless population growth is the longstanding trend on all inhabited continents as well as in most individual states During the 20th century the global population saw its greatest increase in known history rising from about 16 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000 A number of factors contributed to this increase including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution In 2000 the United Nations estimated that the worlds population was growing at an annual rate of 114 equivalent to around 75 million people down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989 By 2000 there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700 Globally the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 219 in 1963 but growth remains high in Latin America the Middle East and SubSaharan Africa During the 2010s Japan and some countries in Europe began to encounter negative population growth ie a net decrease in population over time due to subreplacement fertility rates In 2006 the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition If this trend continues the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050 concurrent with a world population plateau of 92 billion However this is only one of many estimates published by the UN in 2009 UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 105 billion An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility Randers most likely scenario reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 81 billion people followed by decline Adrian Raftery a University of Washington professor of statistics and of sociology states that there’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century Population which had sort of fallen off the world’s agenda remains a very important issue Estimated world population figures 10000 BCE–2000 CE Estimated world population figures 10000 BC–2000 CE in log y scale World population figures 1950–2000 Estimated global growth rates 1950–2050 Estimated and projected populations of the world and its continents except Antarctica from 1950 to 2100 The shaded regions correspond to the range of projections by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population growth by region The table below shows historical and predicted regional population figures in millions The availability of historical population figures varies by region Past population The following table gives estimates of population in the past The data for 1750 to 1900 are from the UN report The World at Six Billion whereas the data from 1950 to 2015 are from a UN data sheet Using the above figures the change in population from 2010 to 2015 was World 420 million Africa 142 million Asia 223 million Europe 3 million Latin America and Caribbean 35 million Northern America 14 million Oceania 29 million Projections Main articles World population estimates and Projections of population growth Longterm global population growth is difficult to predict The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates – according to the UN the world population reached seven billion in late 2011 while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012 The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population based on different assumptions From 2000 to 2005 the UN consistently revised these projections downward until the 2006 revision issued on March 14 2007 revised the 2050 midrange estimate upwards by 273 million Average global birth rates are declining fast but vary greatly between developed countries where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels and developing countries where birth rates typically remain high Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics wars and other mass catastrophes or advances in medicine Mathematical approximations In 1975 Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025 The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a nonlinear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development This feedback can be described as follows technological advance → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence the faster growth of the Earths carrying capacity for people and so on The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition According to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa the world population grew between 67000 BCE and 1965 according to the following formula where N is current population T is the current year C 186±001·10 T0 2007±1 τ displaystyle tau 42±1 Years for world population to double According to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates the world population has doubled or will double in the years listed in the tables below with two different starting points During the 2nd millennium CE each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above However after 2024 it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century Overpopulation Main articles Human overpopulation and Malthusian catastrophe Predictions of scarcity In his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population the British scholar Thomas Malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid19th century Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind In 1968 Paul R Ehrlich reprised Malthus argument in The Population Bomb predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s The predictions of Ehrlich and other neoMalthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists notably Julian Lincoln Simon and advances in agriculture collectively known as the Green Revolution forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century Between 1950 and 1984 as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world grain production increased by over 250 The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution but food production has so far kept pace with population growth Most scholars believe that without the Revolution there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents However neoMalthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the Green Revolution in the form of natural gasderived fertilizers oilderived pesticides and hydrocarbonfueled irrigation and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions In 2004 a metaanalysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a sustainable limit to the world population generated a metaestimate of 77 billion people In May 2008 the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels the increase of world oil prices to over 140 per barrel 880m global population growth the effects of climate change the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India Food riots subsequently occurred in some countries However oil prices then fell sharply Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages David Pimentel professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people its population as of 2015 is over 300 million In 2009 the UK governments chief scientific advisor Professor John Beddington warned that growing populations falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a perfect storm of shortages of food water and energy by 2030 According to a 2009 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO the world will have to produce 70 more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 23 billion people The observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world with 923 million undernourished in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995 The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase to 102 billion Environmental impacts A number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the worlds ecosystem The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994 states that unprecedented population growth aggravates many environmental problems including rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide global warming and pollution Indeed some analysts claim that overpopulations most serious impact is its effect on the environment The situation has continued to worsen as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement the world population stood at 55 billion and lowerbound scenarios predicted a peak of 78 billion by 2050 a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s Scientists contend that human population growth is a primary driver of mass species extinction By 2050 population growth along with profligate consumption could result in oceans containing more plastic than fish by weight Population control Main article Human population control Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth Historically human population control has been implemented by limiting a regions birth rate by voluntary contraception or by government mandate It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty environmental concerns and religious reasons The use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy with religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process The University of Nebraska publication Green Illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive It states that Women who are educated economically engaged and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet The book Fatal Misconception by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time Overpopulation skepticism The Population Research Institute PRI an antiabortion anticontraception advocacy group has criticised predictions of overpopulation and attendant resource scarcity with some describing overpopulation as a myth The PRI argues that advances in agricultural medical and industrial technology have allowed global economic productivity to keep pace with rising populations despite Malthusian predictions to the contrary PRI further says that family sizes are naturally declining worldwide due to higher living standards increased availability of contraception and better economic opportunities for women However other commentators have described PRIs arguments on overpopulation as deceptive Number of humans who have ever lived Further information Paleodemography Estimates of the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of 100 billion Estimates of this kind cannot hope to give more than the rough order of magnitude as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties of the order of 3 to 5 Kapitzka 1996 cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion Haub 1995 prepared another figure updated in 2002 and 2011 the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion Haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period One problem is in regard to the semantic difficulty of deciding the precise meaning of human A population of say 4 million with an average lifespan of say 10 years see below implies a birthrate of 04 million per year which over a period of 100 000 years represents 40 000 million people Also robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries Until the late 18th century few governments had ever performed an accurate census In many early attempts such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service Thus there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations Another critical factor for such an estimate is the question of premodern infant mortality rates these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records Haub 1995 estimates that around 40 of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday Haub also stated that life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of
