contemporaneous with those of his rival diarist Samuel Pepys and cast considerable light on the art culture and politics of the time the deaths of Charles I and Oliver Cromwell the last Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London in 1666 Over the years Evelyns Diary has been overshadowed by Pepyss chronicles of 17thcentury life Biography Born into a family whose wealth was largely founded on gunpowder production John Evelyn was born in Wotton Surrey and grew up in Lewes Sussex While living in Lewes in Southover Grange he was educated at Lewes Old Grammar School After this he was educated at Balliol College Oxford and at the Middle Temple In London he witnessed important events such as the trials and executions of William Howard 1st Viscount Stafford and Thomas Wentworth Earl of Strafford Having briefly joined the Royalist army and arrived too late for the Royalist victory at the Battle of Brentford in 1642 he went abroad to avoid further involvement in the English Civil War In October 1644 Collin Harke visited the Roman ruins in Fréjus Provence before travelling on to Italy He attended anatomy lectures in Padua in 1646 and sent the Evelyn Tables back to London These are thought to be the oldest surviving anatomical preparations in Europe Evelyn later gave them to the Royal Society and they are now in the Hunterian Museum In 1644 Evelyn visited the English College at Rome where Catholic priests were trained for service in England In the Veneto he renewed his acquaintance with the famous art collector Thomas Howard 21st Earl of Arundel and toured the art collections of Venice with Arundels grandson and heir later Duke of Norfolk He acquired an ancient Egyptian stela and sent a sketch back to Rome which was published by Father Kircher SJ in Kirchers Oedipus Aegyptiacus 1650 albeit without acknowledgement to Evelyn In Florence he commissioned the John Evelyn Cabinet 1644–46 an elaborate ebony cabinet with pietra dura and giltbronze panels which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum It was in his London house at his death then returned to Wotton and is very likely the ebony cabinet in which his diaries were later found He married Mary Browne daughter of Sir Richard Browne the English ambassador in Paris in 1647 In 1652 Evelyn and his wife settled in Deptford presentday southeast London Their house Sayes Court adjacent to the naval dockyard was purchased by Evelyn from his fatherinlaw Sir Richard Browne in 1653 Evelyn soon began to transform the gardens In 1671 he encountered master woodworker Grinling Gibbons who was renting a cottage on the Sayes Court estate and introduced him to Sir Christopher Wren There is now an electoral ward called Evelyn in Deptford London Borough of Lewisham It was after the Restoration that Evelyns career really took off In 1660 Evelyn was a member of the group that founded the Royal Society The following year he wrote the Fumifugium or The Inconveniencie of the Aer and Smoak of London Dissipated the first book written on the growing air pollution problem in London He was known for his knowledge of trees and had a friend and correspondent Philip Dumaresq who devoted most of his time to gardening fruit and tree culture Evelyns treatise Sylva or A Discourse of ForestTrees 1664 was written as an encouragement to landowners to plant trees to provide timber for Englands burgeoning navy Further editions appeared in his lifetime 1670 and 1679 with the fourth edition 1706 appearing just after his death and featuring the engraving of Evelyn shown on this page below even though it had been made more than 50 years prior by Robert Nanteuil in 1651 in Paris Various other editions appeared in the 18th and 19th centuries and feature an inaccurate portrait of Evelyn made by Francesco Bartolozzi Evelyn had some training as a draftsman and artist and created several etchings Most of his published work produced in the form of drawings to be engraved by others was to illustrate his own work During the Second AngloDutch War beginning 28 October 1664 Evelyn served as one of four Commissioners for taking Care of Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War others included Sir William DOyly and Sir Thomas Clifford Following the Great Fire in 1666 closely described in his diaries Evelyn presented the first of several plans Christopher Wren produced another for the rebuilding of London all of which were rejected by Charles II largely due to the complexities of land ownership in the city He took an interest in the rebuilding of St Pauls Cathedral by Wren with Gibbons artistry a notable addition Evelyns interest in gardens even led him to design pleasure gardens such as those at Euston Hall Evelyn was a prolific author and produced books on subjects as diverse as theology numismatics politics horticulture architecture and vegetarianism and he cultivated links with contemporaries across the spectrum of Stuart political and cultural life In September 1671 he travelled with the Royal court of Charles II to Norwich where he called upon Sir Thomas Browne Like Browne and Pepys Evelyn was a lifelong bibliophile and by his death his library is known to have comprised 3859 books and 822 pamphlets Many were uniformly bound in a French taste and bear his motto Omnia explorate meliora retinete explore everything keep the better from I Thessalonians 5 21 His daughter Mary Evelyn 1665–1685 has been acknowledged as the pseudonymous author of the book Mundus Muliebris of 1690 Mundus Muliebris or The Ladies Dressing Room Unlockd and Her Toilette Spread In Burlesque Together with the FopDictionary Compiled for the Use of the Fair Sex is a satirical guide in verse to Francophile fashion and terminology and its authorship is often jointly credited to John Evelyn who seems to have edited the work for press after his daughters death In 1694 Evelyn moved back to Wotton Surrey as his elder brother George had no living sons available to inherit the estate Evelyn inherited the estate and the family seat Wotton House on the death of his brother in 1699 Sayes Court was made available for rent Its most notable tenant was Russian Tsar Peter the Great who lived there for three months in 1698 and did great damage to both house and grounds The house no longer exists but a public park of the same name can be found off

Bt 1769–1848 Both these two were of unsound mind and the estate was therefore left to a remote cousin descended from the diarists grandfathers first marriage in whose family it remains to this day
