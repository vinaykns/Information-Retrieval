Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains in the south Bordered by Germany to the west the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south Ukraine and Belarus to the east and the Baltic Sea Kaliningrad Oblast a Russian exclave and Lithuania to the north The total area of Poland is 312679 square kilometres 120726 sq mi making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe With a population of over 385 million people Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions and its capital and largest city is Warsaw Other metropolises include Kraków Wrocław Poznań Gdańsk and Szczecin The establishment of a Polish state can be traced back to 966 when Mieszko I ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of presentday Poland converted to Christianity The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin This union formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe Once a leading European power with a uniquely progressive political system the Commonwealth ceased to exist as an independent state following several territorial partitions among Prussia the Russian Empire and Austria from 1772 to 1795 Poland regained its independence in 1918 at the end of World War I reconstituting much of its historical territory as the Second Polish Republic In September 1939 World War II started with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany followed shortly thereafter by invasion by the Soviet Union both in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact More than six million Polish citizens died in the war After the war Polands borders were shifted westwards under the terms of the Potsdam Conference With the backing of the Soviet Union a communist puppet government was formed and after a falsified referendum in 1946 the Peoples Republic of Poland was established as a Soviet satellite state During the Revolutions of 1989 Polands Communist government was overthrown and Poland adopted a new constitution establishing itself as a democracy informally called the Third Polish Republic Despite the large number of casualties and destruction the country experienced during World War II Poland has managed to preserve much of its rich cultural wealth including 14 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and 54 Historical Monuments among many other objects of cultural heritage Since the early 1990s when the transition to a primarily marketbased economy began Poland has achieved a very high ranking on the Human Development Index as well as improving economic freedom Poland is a democratic country which was categorised by the World Bank as having a highincome economy and is ranked in the top 30 for standard of living Furthermore it is visited by approximately 16 million tourists every year 2014 which makes it the 16th most visited country in the world Poland is the eighth largest economy in the European Union and was the 6th fastest growing economy on the continent between 2010 and 2015 According to the Global Peace Index for 2014 Poland is ranked 19th in the list of the safest countries in the world to live in Etymology Main article Name of Poland The origin of the name Poland derives from a West Slavic tribe of Polans Polanie that inhabited the Warta River basin of the historic Greater Poland region in the 8th century The origin of the name Polanie itself derives from the western Slavic word pole field In some foreign languages such as Hungarian Lithuanian Persian and Turkish the exonym for Poland is Lechites Lechici which derives from the name of a semilegendary ruler of Polans Lech I History Main article History of Poland Prehistory and protohistory Main articles Bronze and IronAge Poland Poland in Antiquity and Poland in the Early Middle Ages Historians have postulated that throughout Late Antiquity many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now Poland The ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated the time and route of the original settlement of Slavic peoples in these regions lacks written records and can only be defined as fragmented The most famous archaeological find from the prehistory and protohistory of Poland is the Biskupin fortified settlement now reconstructed as an openair museum dating from the Lusatian culture of the early Iron Age around 700 BC The Slavic groups who would form Poland migrated to these areas in the second half of the 5th century AD Up until the creation of Mieszkos state and his subsequent conversion to Christianity in 966 AD the main religion of Slavic tribes that inhabited the geographical area of presentday Poland was Slavic paganism With the Baptism of Poland the Polish rulers accepted Christianity and the religious authority of the Roman Church However the transition from paganism was not a smooth and instantaneous process for the rest of the population as evident from the pagan reaction of the 1030s Piast dynasty Main articles History of Poland during the Piast dynasty Civitas Schinesghe and Gesta principum Polonorum Poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the Piast dynasty Polands first historically documented ruler Mieszko I accepted Christianity with the Baptism of Poland in 966 as the new official religion of his subjects The bulk of the population converted in the course of the next few centuries In 1000 Boleslaw the Brave continuing the policy of his father Mieszko held a Congress of Gniezno and created the metropolis of Gniezno and the dioceses of Kraków Kołobrzeg and Wrocław However the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by Casimir I the Restorer In 1109 Prince Bolesław III Wrymouth defeated the King of Germany Henry V at the Battle of Hundsfeld stopping the German march into Poland The significance of the event was documented by Gallus Anonymus in his 1118 chronicle In 1138 Poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when Bolesław divided his lands among his sons In 1226 Konrad I of Masovia one of the regional Piast dukes invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans a decision that led to centuries of warfare with the Knights In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz or the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous right for the Jews in Poland leading to a nearly autonomous nation within a nation In the middle of the 13th century the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty Henry I the Bearded and Henry II the Pious ruled 1238–41 nearly succeeded in uniting the Polish lands but the Mongols invaded the country from the east and defeated the combined Polish forces at the Battle of Legnica where Duke Henry II the Pious died In 1320 after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the Polish dukedoms Władysław I consolidated his power took the throne and became the first king of a reunified Poland His son Casimir III reigned 1333–70 has a reputation as one of the greatest Polish kings and gained wide recognition for improving the countrys infrastructure He also extended royal protection to Jews and encouraged their immigration to Poland Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people especially lawyers who could codify the countrys laws and administer the courts and offices His efforts to create an institution of higher learning in Poland were finally rewarded when Pope Urban V granted him permission to open the University of Kraków The Golden Liberty of the nobles began to develop under Casimirs rule when in return for their military support the king made a series of concessions to the nobility and establishing their legal status as superior to that of the townsmen When Casimir the Great died in 1370 leaving no legitimate male heir the Piast dynasty came to an end During the 12th and 13th centuries Poland became a destination for German Flemish and to a lesser extent Scottish Danish and Walloon migrants Also the Jews and Armenians began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era see History of the Jews in Poland and Armenians in Poland The Black Death a plague that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not significantly affect Poland and the country was spared from a major outbreak of the disease The reason for this was the decision of Casimir the Great to quarantine the nations borders Jagiellon dynasty Main articles History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty and Renaissance in Poland The Jagiellon dynasty spanned the late Middle Ages and early Modern Era of Polish history Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila Władysław II Jagiełło the Jagiellon dynasty 1386–1572 formed the Polish–Lithuanian union The partnership brought vast Lithuaniacontrolled Rus areas into Polands sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries In the Baltic Sea region Polands struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and culminated in the Battle of Grunwald 1410 where a combined PolishLithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against the Teutonic Knights allowing for territorial expansion of both nations into the far north region of Livonia In 1466 after the Thirteen Years War King Casimir IV Jagiellon gave royal consent to the Peace of Thorn which created the future Duchy of Prussia a Polish vassal The Jagiellon dynasty at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of Bohemia 1471 onwards and Hungary In the south Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569 and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow Some historians estimate that Crimean Tatar slaveraiding cost PolandLithuania one million of its population between the years of 1494 and 1694 Poland was developing as a feudal state with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Sejm parliament in 1505 transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm an event which marked the beginning of the period known as Golden Liberty when the state was ruled by the free and equal Polish nobility Protestant Reformation movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance unique in Europe at that time This tolerance allowed the country to avoid most the religious turmoil that spread over Europe during the 16th century The European Renaissance evoked in late Jagiellon Poland kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus a sense of urgency in the need to promote a cultural awakening and during this period Polish culture and the nations economy flourished In 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus a Polish astronomer from Toruń published his epochal work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres and thereby became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the heliocentric theory which became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy Another major figure associated with the era is the classicist poet Jan Kochanowski Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Main articles History of Poland in the Early Modern era 1569–1795 Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sarmatism The 1569 Union of Lublin established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth a more closely unified federal state with an elective monarchy but which was governed largely by the nobility through a system of local assemblies with a central parliament The Warsaw Confederation 1573 confirmed the religious freedom of all residents of Poland which was extremely important for the stability of the multiethnic Polish society of the time Serfdom was banned in 1588 The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in Poland with the union thereafter becoming a European power and a major cultural entity occupying approximately one million square kilometers of Central and Eastern Europe as well as an agent for the dissemination of Western culture through Polonization into areas of modernday Lithuania Ukraine Belarus and Western Russia In the 16th and 17th centuries Poland suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the Vasa kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV and found itself engaged in major conflicts with Russia Sweden and the Ottoman Empire as well as a series of minor Cossack uprisings In 1610 Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski seized Moscow after winning the Battle of Klushino From the middle of the 17th century the nobles democracy suffering from internal disorder gradually declined thereby leaving the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention Starting in 1648 the Cossack Khmelnytsky Uprising engulfed the south and east eventually leaving Ukraine divided with the eastern part lost by the Commonwealth becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia This was followed by the Deluge a Swedish invasion of Poland which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the countrys population culture and infrastructure Around four million of Polands eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics However under John III Sobieski the Commonwealths military prowess was reestablished and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the Battle of Vienna against the Ottoman Army commanded by Kara Mustafa the grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire Sobieskis reign marked the end of the nations goldenera Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy the Commonwealth fell into decline The government became ineffective as a result of largescale internal conflicts eg Lubomirski Rebellion against John II Casimir and rebellious confederations and corrupted legislative processes The nobility fell under the control of a handful of magnats and this compounded with two relatively weak kings of the Saxon Wettin dynasty Augustus II and Augustus III as well as the rise of Russia and Prussia after the Great Northern War only served to worsen the Commonwealths plight Despite this The CommonwealthSaxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealths first reform movement and laid the foundations for the Polish Enlightenment During the later part of the 18th century the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy significant population growth and farreaching progress in the areas of education intellectual life art and especially toward the end of the period evolution of the social and political system The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced Gdańsk Danzig as the leading centre of commerce and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased Age of partitions Main articles History of Poland 1795–1918 and Partitions of Poland The royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanisław II August a Polish aristocrat connected to the Czartoryski family faction of magnates to the monarchy However as a onetime personal admirer of Empress Catherine II of Russia the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor This led to the formation of the 1768 Bar Confederation a szlachta rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors which aimed to preserve Polands independence and the szlachtas traditional privileges Attempts at reform provoked the unions neighbours and in 1772 the First Partition of the Commonwealth by Prussia Russia and Austria took place an act which the Partition Sejm under considerable duress eventually ratified fait accompli Disregarding this loss in 1773 the king established the Commission of National Education the first government education authority in Europe Corporal punishment of children was officially prohibited in 1783 The Great Sejm convened by Stanisław II August in 1788 successfully adopted the 3 May Constitution the first set of modern supreme national laws in Europe However this document accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies generated strong opposition from the Commonwealths nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II who determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the PolishLithuanian state Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the Targowica Confederation an organisation of Polish nobles appealed to the Empress for help In May 1792 Russian forces crossed the Commonwealths frontier thus beginning the PolishRussian War The defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King convinced of the futility of resistance capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation The Confederation then took over the government Russia and Prussia fearing the mere existence of a Polish state arranged for and in 1793 executed the Second Partition of the Commonwealth which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence Eventually in 1795 following the failed Kościuszko Uprising the Commonwealth was partitioned one last time by all three of its more powerful neighbours and with this effectively ceased to exist Era of insurrections Main articles Duchy of Warsaw Grand Duchy of Posen Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and Congress Poland Poles rebelled several times against the partitioners particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century An unsuccessful attempt at defending Polands sovereignty took place in 1794 during the Kościuszko Uprising where a popular and distinguished general Tadeusz Kosciuszko who had several years earlier served under Washington in the American Revolutionary War led Polish insurrectionists against numerically superior Russian forces Despite the victory at the Battle of Racławice his ultimate defeat ended Polands independent existence for 123 years In 1807 Napoleon I of France temporarily recreated a Polish state as the satellite Duchy of Warsaw after a successful Greater Poland Uprising of 1806 against Prussian rule But after the failed Napoleonic Wars Poland was again split between the victorious powers at the Congress of Vienna of 1815 The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar as Congress Poland which had a very liberal constitution However over time the Russian tsar reduced Polish freedoms and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name Meanwhile the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization Thus in the 19th century only Austrian ruled Galicia and particularly the Free City of Kraków allowed free Polish culture to flourish Throughout the period of the partitions political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian Prussian and Austrian governments In 1830 the November Uprising began in Warsaw when led by Lieutenant Piotr Wysocki young noncommissioned officers at the Officer Cadet School in Warsaw revolted They were joined by large segments of Polish society and together forced Warsaws Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city Over the course of the next seven months Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch and a number of other Russian commanders however finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers save distant France and the newborn United States and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General Ivan Paskievich many Polish troops feeling they could not go on withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms After the defeat the semiindependent Congress Poland lost its constitution army and legislative assembly and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire During the Spring of Nations a series of revolutions which swept across Europe Poles took up arms in the Greater Poland Uprising of 1848 to resist Prussian rule Initially the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the Prussian military was sent in to pacify the region Eventually after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the Prussians and the Grand Duchy of Posen was stripped of its autonomy and completely incorporated into the German Confederation In 1863 a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began The January Uprising started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army However the insurrectionists despite being joined by highranking PolishLithuanian officers and numerous politicians were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russiancontrolled Congress Poland and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural selfimprovement Despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions Poland did benefit from largescale industrialisation and modernisation programs instituted by the occupying powers which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity This was particularly true in Greater Poland Silesia and Eastern Pomerania controlled by Prussia later becoming a part of the German Empire areas which eventually thanks largely to the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918 and Silesian Uprisings were reconstituted as a part of the Second Polish Republic becoming the countrys most prosperous regions Reconstruction Main articles History of Poland 1918–39 Kingdom of Poland 1916–18 Second Polish Republic and Battle of Warsaw 1920 During World War I all the Allies agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed in Point 13 of his Fourteen Points A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers and 450000 died Shortly after the armistice with Germany in November 1918 Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic II Rzeczpospolita Polska It reaffirmed its independence after a series of military conflicts the most notable being the Polish–Soviet War 1919–21 when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw an event which is considered to have halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced Vladimir Lenin to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism The event is often referred to as the Miracle at the Vistula During this period Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards Warsaw instead of the former imperial capitals a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a major seaport was opened on the Baltic Coast so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged Free City of Danzig The interwar period heralded in a new era of Polish politics Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition For this reason many exiled Polish activists such as Ignacy Paderewski who would later become prime minister returned home to help a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures Tragedy struck in 1922 when Gabriel Narutowicz inaugural holder of the presidency was assassinated at the Zachęta Gallery in Warsaw by painter and rightwing nationalist Eligiusz Niewiadomski The 1926 May Coup of Józef Piłsudski turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the Sanacja movement By the 1930s Poland had become increasingly authoritarian a number of undesirable political parties such as the Polish Communists had been banned and following Piłsudskis death the regime unable to appoint a new leader began to show its inherent internal weaknesses and unwillingness to cooperate in any way with other political parties As result of the Munich Agreement in 1938 major European powers Germany France Britain and Italy awarded Poland the small 350 sq mi Zaolzie Region of Czechoslovakia The area was a point of contention between the Polish and Czechoslovak governments in the past and the two countries fought a brief sevenday war over it in 1919 World War II Main articles History of Poland 1939–45 Invasion of Poland Polish contribution to World War II and War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II The formal beginning of World War II was marked by the Nazi German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 followed by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September in violation of the Soviet–Polish NonAggression Pact On 28 September 1939 Warsaw capitulated As agreed earlier in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact Poland was split into two occupied zones one subdivided by Nazi Germany while the other including all of eastern Kresy fell under the control of the Soviet Union In 1939–41 the Soviets had deported hundreds of thousands of Poles out to the most distant parts of the Soviet Union The Soviet NKVD secretly executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war inter alia Katyn massacre ahead of the Operation Barbarossa German planners had in November 1939 called for the complete destruction of all Poles and their fate as well as many other Slavs was outlined in genocidal Generalplan Ost During the war Poland made the fourthlargest troop contribution to the Allied war effort after the Soviets the British and the Americans Polish troops fought under the command of both the Polish Government in Exile in the west and under Soviet leadership in the east The Polish expeditionary corps which was controlled by the exiled prewar government based in London played an important role in the Italian and North African Campaigns They are particularly well remembered for their conduct at the Battle of Monte Cassino a conflict which culminated in the raising of a Polish flag over the ruins of the mountaintop abbey by the 12th Podolian Uhlans The Polish forces in the west were commanded by Lieutenant General Władysław Anders who had received his command from prime minister of the exiled government Władysław Sikorski In the east the Sovietbacked Polish 1st Army distinguished itself in the battles for Warsaw and Berlin Polish servicemen were also active in the theatres of naval and air warfare during the Battle of Britain Polish squadrons such as the No 303 Kościuszko fighter squadron achieved considerable success and by the end of the war the exiled Polish Air Forces could claim 769 confirmed kills Meanwhile the Polish Navy was active in the protection of convoys in the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean In addition to the organised units of the 1st Army and the Forces in the Nazioccupied Europe the domestic underground resistance movement the Armia Krajowa Home Army fought against the German occupation The wartime resistance movement in Poland was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities which essentially functioned as an underground state complete with degreeawarding universities and a court system The resistance was however largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland for this reason in the summer of 1944 they initiated Operation Tempest of which the Warsaw Uprising that begun on 1 August 1944 was the best known operation The objective of the uprising was to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers However secondary motives for the uprising sought to see Warsaw liberated before the Soviets could reach the capital so as to underscore Polish sovereignty by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Sovietbacked Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control However a lack of available allied military aid and Stalins reluctance to allow the 1st Army to help their fellow countrymen take the city led to the uprisings failure and subsequent planned destruction of the city During the war German forces under direct order from Adolf Hitler set up six major extermination camps all of which operated in the heart of Poland They included the notorious Treblinka Majdanek and Auschwitz killing centers This allowed the Germans to transport the condemned Jews under the guise of resettlement from the Third Reich and across occupied Europe and systematically murder them in the death camps set up in the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany The Nazi crimes against the Polish nation claimed the lives of 29 million Polish Jews and 28 million ethnic Poles including Polish academics doctors lawyers nobility priests and numerous others Since 35 million Jews lived in prewar Poland Jewish victims make up the largest percentage of all victims of the Nazis extermination program It is estimated that of prewar Polands Jewry approximately 90 were killed Throughout the occupation many members of the Armia Krajowa supported by the Polish government in exile and millions of ordinary Poles – at great risk to themselves and their families – engaged in rescuing Jews from the Nazi Germans Grouped by nationality Poles represent the largest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust To date 6620 Poles have been awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel–more than any other nation Some estimates put the number of Poles involved in rescue efforts at up to 3 million and credit Poles with sheltering up to 450000 Jews Also some 150000 Polish civilians were killed by Soviet Communists between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Unions occupation of eastern Poland Kresy and another estimated 100000 Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army UPA in the regions of Wołyń and Eastern Galicia between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the Wołyń Massacres The massacres were part of a vicious ethnic clensing campaign waged by Ukrainian nationalists against the local Polish population in the Germanoccupied territories of eastern Poland At the wars conclusion in 1945 Polands borders were shifted westwards resulting in considerable territorial losses Most of the Polish inhabitants of Kresy were expelled along the Curzon Line in accordance with Stalins agreements The western border was moved to the OderNeisse line As a result Polands territory was reduced by 20 or 77500 square kilometres 29900 sq mi The shift forced the migration of millions of other people most of whom were Poles Germans Ukrainians and Jews Of all the countries involved in the war Poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens over 6 million perished – nearly onefifth of Polands population – half of them Polish Jews Over 90 of deaths were nonmilitary in nature Population numbers did not recover until the 1970s Postwar communism Main articles History of Poland 1945–1989 Polish Peoples Republic History of Solidarity and Polish Round Table Agreement At the insistence of Joseph Stalin the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a new provisional proCommunist coalition government in Moscow which ignored the Polish governmentinexile based in London a move which angered many Poles who considered it a betrayal by the Allies In 1944 Stalin had made guarantees to Churchill and Roosevelt that he would maintain Polands sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place However upon achieving victory in 1945 the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs The Soviet Union instituted a new communist government in Poland analogous to much of the rest of the Eastern Bloc As elsewhere in Communist Europe the Soviet occupation of Poland met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the fifties Despite widespread objections the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the prewar eastern regions of Poland in particular the cities of Wilno and Lwów and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of Red Army units on Polands territory Military alignment within the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War came about as a direct result of this change in Polands political culture and in the European scene came to characterise the fullfledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations The Peoples Republic of Poland Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa was officially proclaimed in 1952 In 1956 after the death of Bolesław Bierut the régime of Władysław Gomułka became temporarily more liberal freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms Collectivization in the Polish Peoples Republic failed A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under Edward Gierek but most of the time persecution of anticommunist opposition groups persisted Despite this Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Soviet Bloc Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union Solidarity Solidarność which over time became a political force Despite persecution and imposition of martial law in 1981 it eroded the dominance of the Polish United Workers Party and by 1989 had triumphed in Polands first partially free and democratic parliamentary elections since the end of the Second World War Lech Wałęsa a Solidarity candidate eventually won the presidency in 1990 The Solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communist regimes and parties across Europe Presentday Main articles History of Poland 1989–present and 2004 enlargement of the European Union A shock therapy programme initiated by Leszek Balcerowicz in the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its socialiststyle planned economy into a market economy As with other postcommunist countries Poland suffered slumps in social and economic standards but it became the first postcommunist country to reach its pre1989 GDP levels which it achieved by 1995 largely thanks to its booming economy Most visibly there were numerous improvements in human rights such as freedom of speech internet freedom no censorship civil liberties 1st class and political rights 1st class as ranked by Freedom House nongovernmental organization In 1991 Poland became a member of the Visegrád Group and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO alliance in 1999 along with the Czech Republic Slovakia and Hungary Poles then voted to join the European Union in a referendum in June 2003 with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004 Poland joined the Schengen Area in 2007 as a result of which the countrys borders with other member states of the European Union have been dismantled allowing for full freedom of movement within most of the EU In contrast to this a section of Polands eastern border now comprises the external EU border with Belarus Russia and Ukraine That border has become increasingly well protected and has led in part to the coining of the phrase Fortress Europe in reference to the seeming impossibility of gaining entry to the EU for citizens of the former Soviet Union In an effort to strengthen military cooperation with its neighbors Poland set up the Visegrád Battlegroup with Hungary Czech Republic and Slovakia with a total of 3000 troops ready for deployment Also in the east Poland created the LITPOLUKRBRIG battle groups with Lithuania and Ukraine These battle groups will operate outside of NATO and within the European defense initiative framework On 10 April 2010 the President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński along with 89 other highranking Polish officials died in a plane crash near Smolensk Russia The presidents party was on their way to attend an annual service of commemoration for the victims of the Katyń massacre when the tragedy took place In 2011 the Presidency of the Council of the European Union responsible for the functioning of the Council was awarded to Poland The same year parliamentary elections took place in both the Senate and the Sejm They were won by the ruling Civic Platform Poland joined European Space Agency in 2012 as well as organised the UEFA Euro 2012 along with Ukraine In 2013 Poland also became a member of the Development Assistance Committee In 2014 the Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk was chosen to be President of the European Council as resigned as prime minister The 2015 elections were won by the opposion Law and Justice Party PiS Geography Main article Geography of Poland Polands territory extends across several geographical regions between latitudes 49° and 55° N and longitudes 14° and 25° E In the northwest is the Baltic seacoast which extends from the Bay of Pomerania to the Gulf of Gdańsk This coast is marked by several spits coastal lakes former bays that have been cut off from the sea and dunes The largely straight coastline is indented by the Szczecin Lagoon the Bay of Puck and the Vistula Lagoon The centre and parts of the north of the country lie within the North European Plain Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of moraines and morainedammed lakes formed during and after the Pleistocene ice age These lake districts are the Pomeranian Lake District the Greater Polish Lake District the Kashubian Lake District and the Masurian Lake District The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of northeastern Poland The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea South of the Northern European Plain are the regions of Lusatia Silesia and Masovia which are marked by broad iceage river valleys Farther south is a mountainous region including the Sudetes the KrakówCzęstochowa Upland the Świętokrzyskie Mountains and the Carpathian Mountains including the Beskids The highest part of the Carpathians is the Tatra Mountains along Polands southern border Geology The geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the continental collision of Europe and Africa over the past 60 million years and more recently by the Quaternary glaciations of northern Europe Both processes shaped the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or loam while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain loess The KrakówCzęstochowa Upland the Pieniny and the Western Tatras consist of limestone while the High Tatras the Beskids and the Karkonosze are made up mainly of granite and basalts The Polish Jura Chain is one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth Poland has 70 mountains

in southern Poland is an area of sparsely vegetated sand known as the Błędów Desert It covers an area of 32 square kilometres 12 sq mi It is not a natural desert but results from human activity from the Middle Ages onwards The Baltic Sea activity in Słowiński National Park created sand dunes which in the course of time separated the bay from the sea creating two lakes As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move at a rate of 3 to 10 metres 98 to 328 ft meters per year Some dunes reach the height of up to 30 metres 98 ft The highest peak of the park is Rowokol 115 metres or 377 feet above sea level Waters Main article Rivers of Poland The longest rivers are the Vistula Polish Wisła 1047 kilometres 651 mi long the Oder Polish Odra which forms part of Polands western border 854 kilometres 531 mi long its tributary the Warta 808 kilometres 502 mi long and the Bug a tributary of the Vistula 772 kilometres 480 mi long The Vistula and the Oder flow into the Baltic Sea as do numerous smaller rivers in Pomerania The Łyna and the Angrapa flow by way of the Pregolya to the Baltic and the Czarna Hańcza flows into the Baltic through the Neman While the great majority of Polands rivers drain into the Baltic Sea Polands Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the Orava which flows via the Váh and the Danube to the Black Sea The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the Dniester to the Black Sea Polands rivers have been used since early times for navigation The Vikings for example traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their longships In the Middle Ages and in early modern times when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was the breadbasket of Europe the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward Gdańsk and onward to other parts of Europe took on great importance In the valley of Pilica river in Tomaszów Mazowiecki there is a unique natural karst spring of water containing calcium salts that is an object of protection in Niebieskie Źródła Nature Reserve in Sulejów Landscape Park The origin of the name of the reserve Niebieskie Źródła that means Blue Springs comes from the fact that red waves are absorbed by water and only blue and green are reflected from the bottom of the spring giving that atypical colour With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than 1 hectare 247 acres each Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world In Europe only Finland has a greater density of lakes The largest lakes covering more than 100 square kilometres 39 sq mi are Lake Śniardwy and Lake Mamry in Masuria and Lake Łebsko and Lake Drawsko in Pomerania In addition to the lake districts in the north in Masuria Pomerania Kashubia Lubuskie and Greater Poland there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area The lake with the greatest depth—of more than 100 metres 328 ft—is Lake Hańcza in the Wigry Lake District east of Masuria in Podlaskie Voivodeship Among the first lakes whose shores were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District The stilt house settlement of Biskupin occupied by more than one thousand residents was founded before the 7th century BC by people of the Lusatian culture Lakes have always played an important role in Polish history and continue to be of great importance to todays modern Polish society The ancestors of todays Poles the Polanie built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes The legendary Prince Popiel ruled from Kruszwica tower erected on the Lake Gopło The first historically documented ruler of Poland Duke Mieszko I had his palace on an island in the Warta River in Poznań Nowadays the Polish lakes provide a location for the pursuit of water sports such as yachting and windsurfing The Polish Baltic coast is approximately 528 kilometres 328 mi long and extends from Świnoujście on the islands of Usedom and Wolin in the west to Krynica Morska on the Vistula Spit in the east For the most part Poland has a smooth coastline which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds This continual erosion and deposition has formed cliffs dunes and spits many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons such as Łebsko Lake in Słowiński National Park Prior to the end of the Second World War and subsequent change in national borders Poland had only a very small coastline this was situated at the end of the Polish Corridor the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea However after World War II the redrawing of Polands borders and resulting shift of the countrys borders left it with an expanded coastline thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible The significance of this event and importance of it to Polands future as a major industrialised nation was alluded to by the 1945 Wedding to the Sea The largest spits are Hel Peninsula and the Vistula Spit The largest Polish Baltic island is called Wolin The largest sea harbours are Szczecin Świnoujście Gdańsk Gdynia Police and Kołobrzeg and the main coastal resorts – Świnoujście Międzyzdroje Kołobrzeg Łeba Sopot Władysławowo and the Hel Peninsula Land use Poland is the fourth most forested country in Europe Forests cover about 305 of Polands land area based on international standards Its overall percentage is still increasing Forests of Poland are managed by the national program of reforestation KPZL aiming at an increase of forestcover to 33 in 2050 The richness of Polish forest per SoEF 2011 statistics is more than twice as high as European average with Germany and France at the top containing 2304 billion cubic metres of trees The largest forest complex in Poland is Lower Silesian Wilderness More than 1 of Polands territory 3145 square kilometres 1214 sq mi is protected within 23 Polish national parks Three more national parks are projected for Masuria the KrakówCzęstochowa Upland and the eastern Beskids In addition wetlands along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected as are coastal areas in the north There are over 120 areas designated as landscape parks along with numerous nature reserves and other protected areas eg Natura 2000 Since Polands accession to the European Union in 2004 Polish agriculture has performed extremely well and the country has over two million private farms It is the leading producer in Europe of potatoes and rye worlds second largest in 1989 the worlds largest producer of triticale and one of the more important producers of barley oats sugar beets flax and fruits Poland is the European Unions fourth largest supplier of pork after Germany Spain and France Biodiversity Phytogeographically Poland belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom According to the World Wide Fund for Nature the territory of Poland belongs to three Palearctic Ecoregions of the continental forest spanning Central and Northern European temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ecoregions as well as the Carpathian montane conifer forest Many animals that have since died out in other parts of Europe still survive in Poland such as the wisent in the ancient woodland of the Białowieża Forest and in Podlaskie Other such species include the brown bear in Białowieża in the Tatras and in the Beskids the gray wolf and the Eurasian lynx in various forests the moose in northern Poland and the beaver in Masuria Pomerania and Podlaskie In the forests one also encounters game animals such as red deer roe deer and wild boars In eastern Poland there are a number of ancient woodlands like Białowieża forest that have never been cleared or have been disturbed much by people There are also large forested areas in the mountains Masuria Pomerania Lubusz Land and Lower Silesia Poland is the most important breeding ground for a variety of European migratory birds Out of all of the migratory birds who come to Europe for the summer one quarter of the global population of white storks 40000 breeding pairs live in Poland particularly in the lake districts and the wetlands along the Biebrza the Narew and the Warta which are part of nature reserves or national parks Climate The climate is mostly temperate throughout the country The climate is oceanic in the north and west and becomes gradually warmer and continental towards the south and east Summers are generally warm with average temperatures between 18 and 30 °C 644 and 860 °F depending on a region Winters are rather cold with average temperatures around 3 °C 374 °F in the northwest and −6 °C 21 °F in the northeast Precipitation falls throughout the year although especially in the east winter is drier than summer The warmest region in Poland is Lower Silesia located in southwestern Poland where temperatures in the summer average between 24 and 32 °C 75 and 90 °F but can go as high as 34 to 39 °C 932 to 1022 °F on some days in the warmest month of July and August The warmest cities in Poland are Tarnów which is situated in Lesser Poland and Wrocław which is located in Lower Silesia The average temperatures in Wrocław are 20 °C 68 °F in the summer and 0 °C 320 °F in the winter but Tarnów has the longest summer in all of Poland which lasts for 115 days from midMay to midSeptember The coldest region of Poland is in the northeast in the Podlaskie Voivodeship near the border of Belarus and Lithuania Usually the coldest city is Suwałki The climate is affected by cold fronts which come from Scandinavia and Siberia The average temperature in the winter in Podlaskie ranges from −6 to −4 °C 21 to 25 °F The biggest impact of the oceanic climate is observed in Świnoujście and Baltic Sea seashore area from Police to Słupsk Politics Main article Politics of Poland Poland is a representative democracy with a president as a head of state whose current constitution dates from 1997 Poland ranks in the top 20 percent of the most peaceful countries in the world according to the Global Peace Index The government structure centers on the Council of Ministers led by a prime minister The president appoints the cabinet according to the proposals of the prime minister typically from the majority coalition in the Sejm The president is elected by popular vote every five years The current president is Andrzej Duda and the prime minister is Beata Szydło Polish voters elect a bicameral parliament consisting of a 460member lower house Sejm and a 100member Senate Senat The Sejm is elected under proportional representation according to the dHondt method a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems The Senat on the other hand is elected under the firstpastthepost voting method with one senator being returned from each of the 100 constituencies With the exception of ethnic minority parties only candidates of political parties receiving at least 5 of the total national vote can enter the Sejm When sitting in joint session members of the Sejm and Senat form the National Assembly the Zgromadzenie Narodowe The National Assembly is formed on three occasions when a new president takes the oath of office when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the State Tribunal Trybunał Stanu and when a presidents permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health is declared To date only the first instance

observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish citizens and residents of the law and of principles of community life and social justice Law Main article Law of Poland The Constitution of Poland is the supreme law in contemporary Poland and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights governed by the code of Civil Law Historically the most famous Polish legal act is the Constitution of 3 May 1791 Historian Norman Davies describes it as the first of its kind in Europe The Constitution was instituted as a Government Act Polish Ustawa rządowa and then adopted on 3 May 1791 by the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Primarily it was designed to redress longstanding political defects of the federative Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its Golden Liberty Previously only the Henrican articles signed by each of Polands elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws The new Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and the nobility szlachta and placed the peasants under the protection of the government The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto which at one time had placed the sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose or be bribed by an interest or foreign power to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the countrys reactionary magnates with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy The adoption of the constitution was treated as a threat by Polands neighbours In response Prussia Austria and Russia formed an antiPolish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to partition their weaker neighbour and destroyed the Polish state In the words of two of its coauthors Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj the constitution represented the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland Despite this its text influenced many later democratic movements across the globe In Poland freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Article 25 section I The Republic and Article 54 section II The Freedoms Rights and Obligations of Persons and Citizens of the Constitution of Poland Feminism in Poland started in the 1800s in the age of the foreign Partitions Polands precursor of

mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours this has notably included signing friendship treaties to replace links severed by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact Poland has forged a special relationships with Ukraine with whom it cohosted the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the Western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the Russian Federation Despite many positive developments in the region Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the former Soviet Union this is particularly true of Belarus where in 2005 the Lukashenko regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority Poland is the sixth most populous member state of the European Union and has a grand total of 51 representatives in the European Parliament Ever since joining the union in 2004 successive Polish governments have pursued policies to increase the countrys role in European and regional affairs Administrative divisions Main article Administrative divisions of Poland Polands current voivodeships provinces are largely based on the countrys historic regions whereas those of the past two decades to 1998 had been centred on and named for individual cities The new units range in area from less than 10000 square kilometres 3900 sq mi for Opole Voivodeship to more than 35000 square kilometres 14000 sq mi for Masovian Voivodeship Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a governmentappointed voivode governor an elected regional assembly sejmik and an executive elected by that assembly The voivodeships are subdivided into powiats often referred to in English as counties and these are further divided into gminas also known as communes or municipalities Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat Poland has 16 voivodeships 379 powiats including 65 cities with powiat status and 2478

26126 servicemen and women The Polish Navy primarily operates in the Baltic Sea and conducts operations such as maritime patrol search and rescue for the section of the Baltic under Polish sovereignty as well as hydrographic measurements and research Also the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the 2003 invasion of Iraq providing logistical support for the United States Navy The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same it has routinely taken part in Baltic Air Policing assignments but otherwise with the exception of a number of units serving in Afghanistan has seen no active combat since the end of the Second World War In 2003 the F16C Block 52 was chosen as the new general multirole fighter for the air force the first deliveries taking place in November 2006 The most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad Polands national security goal is to further integrate with NATO and European defence economic and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military The armed forces are being reorganised according to NATO standards and since 2010 the transition to an entirely contractbased military has been completed Compulsory military service for men was discontinued in 2008 From 2007 until conscription ended in 2008 the mandatory service was nine months Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners From 1953 to 2009 Poland was a large contributor to various United Nations peacekeeping missions The Polish Armed Forces took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq deploying 2500 soldiers in the south of that country and commanding the 17nation Multinational force in Iraq The military was temporarily but severely affected by the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu154 crash which killed the Chief of the Armys General Staff Franciszek Gągor and Air Force commanding general Andrzej Błasik among others Currently Polands military is going through a significant modernization phase which will be completed in 2022 The government plans to spend up to 130 billion złoty US 34 billion—however the final total may reach 235 billion złoty US 62 billion—to replace dated equipment and purchase new weapons systems Under the program the military plans to purchase new tracked armoured personnel carriers selfpropelled howitzers utility and attack helicopters a midrange surfacetoair missile system attack submarines minehunters and coastal antiship missiles Also the army plans to modernize its existing inventory of main battle tanks and update its stock of small arms Law enforcement and emergency services Main articles Law enforcement in Poland and Emergency medical services in Poland Poland has a highly developed system of law enforcement with a long history of effective policing by the State Police Service The structure of law enforcement agencies within Poland is a multitier one with the State Police providing criminalinvestigative services Municipal Police serving to maintain public order and a number of other specialised agencies such as the Polish Border Guard acting to fulfil their assigned missions In addition to these state services private security companies are also common although they possess no powers assigned to state agencies such as for example the power to make an arrest or detain a suspect Emergency services in Poland consist of the emergency medical services search and rescue units of the Polish Armed Forces and State Fire Service Emergency medical services in Poland are unlike other services provided for by local and regional government Since joining the European Union all of Polands emergency services have been undergoing major restructuring and have in the process acquired large amounts of new equipment and staff All emergency services personnel are now uniformed and can be easily recognised In addition the police and other agencies have been steadily replacing and modernising their fleets of vehicles Economy Main article Economy of Poland Polands economy is considered to be one of the more resilient of the postCommunist countries and is one of the fastest growing within the EU Having a strong domestic market low private debt flexible currency and not being dependent on a single export sector Poland is the only European economy to have avoided the late2000s recession Since the fall of the communist government Poland has pursued a policy of liberalising the economy It is an example of the transition from a centrally planned to a primarily marketbased economy The countrys most successful exports include machinery furniture food products clothing shoes and cosmetics Polands largest trading partner is Germany The privatization of small and medium stateowned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms have allowed the development of the private sector Also several consumer rights organizations have become active in the country Restructuring and privatisation of sensitive sectors such as coal steel rail transport and energy has been continuing since 1990 The biggest privatisations have been the sale of the national telecoms firm Telekomunikacja Polska to France Télécom in 2000 and an issue of 30 of the shares in Polands largest bank PKO Bank Polski on the Polish stockmarket in 2004 Poland is recognised as having an economy with development potential overtaking the Netherlands in mid2010 to become Europes sixth largest economy Foreign Direct Investment in Poland has remained steady ever since the countrys political transformation following the Round Table Agreement in 1989 However problems still exist—it is believed that progress of privatization was uneven across sectors due to emergence of interest groups supporting governments push for the reforms based on feasibility rather than efficiency at the cost of Polands remaining sectors in need of development and modernisation such as the extractive industries The Polish banking sector is the largest in East CentralEastern European region with 323 branches per 100000 adults The banks are the largest and most developed sector of the countrys financial markets They are regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority During the transformation to a marketoriented economy the government privatized several banks recapitalized

Voivodeship Since the opening of the labor market in the European Union Poland experienced a mass emigration of over 23 million abroad mainly due to higher wages offered abroad and due to the raise in levels of unemployment following the global Great Recession of 2008 The out migration has increased the average wages for the workers who remained in Poland in particular for those with intermediate level skills Products and goods manufactured in Poland include electronics buses and trams Solaris Solbus helicopters and planes PZL Świdnik PZL Mielec trains Pesa SA ships Gdańsk Shipyard Szczecin

mining in Poland The electricity generation sector in Poland is largely fossilfuel–based Many power plants nationwide use Polands position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy In 2013 Poland scored 48 out of 129 states in the Energy Sustainability Index The three largest Polish coal mining firms Węglokoks Kompania Węglowa and JSW extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually All three of these companies are key constituents of the Warsaw Stock Exchanges lead economic indexes Renewable forms of energy account for a small proportion of Polands full energy generation capacity However the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland which should see the portion of power produced by renewable resources climb to 75 by 2010 and 15 by 2020 This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of wind farms and a number of hydroelectric stations Poland is thought to have around 164800000000 m of proven natural gas reserves and around 96380000 barrels of proven oil reserves These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as PKN Orlen the only Polish company listed in the Fortune Global 500 However the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population Therefore the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas Transport Main article Transport in Poland Transport in Poland is provided by means of rail road marine shipping and air travel Positioned in Central Europe with its eastern and part of its northeastern border constituting the longest land border of the Schengen Area with the rest of Northern and Central Europe Since joining the EU in May 2004 Poland has invested large amounts of public funds into modernization projects of its transport networks The country now has a developing highways

intricate 1000year history Its unique character developed as a result of its geography at the confluence of European cultures With origins in the culture of the ProtoSlavs over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the Germanic Latinate and Byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries In the 19th and 20th centuries the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art with all its complex nuances Famous people The list of famous Poles begins in earnest with the polymath Mikołaj Kopernik Nicolaus Copernicus who studied at the Jagiellonian University founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great from proceeds of his Wieliczka Salt Mine Poland is the birthplace of many distinguished personalities among whom are Fryderyk Chopin Maria Skłodowska Curie Tadeusz Kościuszko Kazimierz Pułaski Józef Piłsudski Lech Wałęsa

other countries ethnic minority rights in Poland are guaranteed directly by the Constitution of Poland art 35 Throughout most of its history Poland has experienced only very limited immigration from abroad this trend can be largely attributed to Polands rejection of slavery and to a lack of overseas colonies as well as occupation of its territories during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries Despite this the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background This can be said to stem largely from the reign of King Casimir III the Great and his acceptance of Polands Jewish community in a time when most of Europe recessed into antisemitic moods and actions The history of Jews in Poland exemplifies peaceful coexistence of a nation with a particular ethnic group In 2013 the Polish parliament rejected proposed legislation for civil partnerships which the majority of Polish society is against but for the first time it gave an asylum to a gay person from Uganda on the basis of the sexual orientation In a 2013 opinion poll conducted by CBOS 60 of Poles were against

Penderecki composed in Poland Andrzej Panufnik emigrated Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many wellknown Polish composers and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin a

form known as the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata mazurka waltz nocturne polonaise étude impromptu and prélude he was also the composer of a number of polonaises

scene with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace Polish jazz musicians such as Krzysztof Komeda created a unique style which was most famous in the 1960s
