 Counterterrorism also spelled counterterrorism also called antiterrorism incorporates the practice military tactics techniques and strategy that government military law enforcement business and intelligence agencies use to combat or prevent terrorism Counterterrorism strategies include attempts to counter financing of terrorism If terrorism is part of a broader insurgency counterterrorism may employ counterinsurgency measures The United States Armed Forces use the term foreign internal defense for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency lawlessness or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop History In response to the escalating terror campaign in Britain carried out by the militant Irish Fenians in the 1880s the Home Secretary Sir William Harcourt established the first counterterrorism unit ever The Special Irish Branch was initially formed as a section of the Criminal Investigation Department of the London Metropolitan Police in 1883 to combat Irish republican terrorism through infiltration and subversion Harcourt envisioned a permanent unit dedicated to the prevention of politically motivated violence through the use of modern techniques such as undercover infiltration This pioneering branch was the first to be trained in counterterrorism techniques Its name was changed to Special Branch as it had its remit gradually expanded to incorporate a general role in counterterrorism combating foreign subversion and infiltrating organized crime Law enforcement agencies in Britain and elsewhere established similar units Counterterrorism forces expanded with the perceived growing threat of terrorism in the late 20th century Specifically after the September 11 attacks Western governments made counterterrorism efforts a priority including more foreign cooperation shifting tactics involving red teams and preventive measures Planning Intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance See also Intelligence cycle management Intelligence analysis HUMINT and Counterintelligence Most counterterrorism strategies involve an increase in standard police and domestic intelligence The central activities are traditional interception of communications and the tracing of persons New technology has however expanded the range of military and law enforcement operations Domestic intelligence is often directed at specific groups defined on the basis of origin or religion which is a source of political controversy Mass surveillance of an entire population raises objections on civil liberties grounds Homegrown terrorists especially lone wolves are often harder to detect because of their citizenship or legal status and ability to stay under the radar To select the effective action when terrorism appears to be more of an isolated event the appropriate government organizations need to understand the source motivation methods of preparation and tactics of terrorist groups Good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation as well as political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved Ideally one gets information from inside the group a very difficult challenge for HUMINT because operational terrorist cells are often small with all members known to one another perhaps even related Counterintelligence is a great challenge with the security of cellbased systems since the ideal but nearly impossible goal is to obtain a clandestine source within the cell Financial tracking can play a role as can communications intercept but both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy Legal contexts Main article Antiterrorism legislation In response to the growing legislation The United Kingdom has had antiterrorism legislation in place for more than thirty years The Prevention of Violence Act 1939 was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army IRA campaign of violence under the SPlan This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the Prevention of Terrorism Acts a response to the Troubles in Northern Ireland From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent Terrorism Act 2000 which contained many of their powers and then the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 The Antiterrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19 2001 two months after the September 11 2001 attacks in the United States It received royal assent and went into force on December 13 2001 On December 16 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights but under the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998 it remained in force The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the Terrorism Act 2006 creates new offences related to terrorism and amends existing ones The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial Since 1978 the UKs terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a securitycleared Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation whose reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full US legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of deadly force by law enforcement organizations Search and seizure is governed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution The US passed the USA PATRIOT Act after the September 11 attacks as well as a range of other legislation and executive orders relating to national security The Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate antiterrorism as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents The Posse Comitatus Act limits domestic employment of the United States Army and the United States Air Force requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army andor the Air Force Pentagon policy also applies this limitation to the United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy because the Posse Comitatus Act doesnt cover naval services even though they are federal military forces The Department of Defense can be employed domestically on Presidential order as was done during the Los Angeles riots of 1992 Hurricane Katrina and the Beltway Sniper incidents External or international use of lethal force would require a Presidential finding In February 2017 sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the US government program Countering Violent Extremism CVE to solely focus on Islamist extremism Australia has passed several antiterrorism acts In 2004 a bill comprising three acts Antiterrorism Act 2004 No 2 and No 3 was passed Then AttorneyGeneral Philip Ruddock introduced the Antiterrorism bill 2004 on March 31 He described it as a bill to strengthen Australias counterterrorism laws in a number of respects – a task made more urgent following the recent tragic terrorist bombings in Spain He said that Australias counterterrorism laws require review and where necessary updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism The Australian AntiTerrorism Act 2005 supplemented the powers of the earlier acts The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year The Australian AntiTerrorism Act of 2005 included a shoottokill clause In a country with entrenched liberal democratic traditions the measures are controversial and have been criticized by civil libertarians and Islamic groups Israel monitors a list of designated terrorist organizations and has laws forbidding membership in such organizations funding or helping them in any way On December 14 2006 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled targeted killings were a permitted form of selfdefense In 2016 the Israeli Knesseth passed a comprehensive law against terrorism forbidding any kind of terrorism and support of terrorism and setting severe punishments for terrorists The law also regulate legal efforts against terrorism Human rights One of the primary difficulties of implementing effective counterterrorist measures is the waning of civil liberties and individual privacy that such measures often entail both for citizens of and for those detained by states attempting to combat terror At times measures designed to tighten security have been seen as abuses of power or even violations of human rights Examples of these problems can include prolonged incommunicado detention without judicial review risk of subjecting to torture during the transfer return and extradition of people between or within countries and the adoption of security measures that restrain the rights or freedoms of citizens and breach principles of nondiscrimination Examples include In November 2003 Malaysia passed new counterterrorism laws that were widely criticized by local human rights groups for being vague and overbroad Critics claim that the laws put the basic rights of free expression association and assembly at risk Malaysia persisted in holding around 100 alleged militants without trial including five Malaysian students detained for alleged terrorist activity while studying in Karachi Pakistan In November 2003 a CanadianSyrian national Maher Arar alleged publicly that he had been tortured in a Syrian prison after being handed over to the Syrian authorities by US In December 2003 Colombias congress approved legislation that would give the military the power to arrest tap telephones and carry out searches without warrants or any previous judicial order Images of unpopular treatment of detainees in US custody in Iraq and other locations have encouraged international scrutiny of US operations in the war on terror Hundreds of foreign nationals remain in prolonged indefinite detention without charge or trial in Guantánamo Bay despite international and US constitutional standards some groups believe outlaw such practices Hundreds of people suspected of connections with the Taliban or al Qaeda remain in longterm detention in Pakistan or in UScontrolled centers in Afghanistan China has used the war on terror to justify its policies in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region to stifle Uighur identity In Morocco Saudi Arabia Tunisia Yemen and other countries scores of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in connection with suspected terrorist acts or links to opposition armed groups Until 2005 eleven men remained in high security detention in the UK under the AntiTerrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 Many would argue that such violations could exacerbate rather than counter the terrorist threat Human rights advocates argue for the crucial role of human rights protection as an intrinsic part to fight against terrorism This suggests as proponents of human security have long argued that respecting human rights may indeed help us to incur security Amnesty International included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism Madrid March 8–11 2005 Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated Consequently the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law We recommend 1 taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counterterrorism measures 2 the incorporation of human rights laws in all antiterrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies While international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states proponents of human rights as well as human security have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism Preemptive neutralization Some countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy This includes capturing killing or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack Israel the United Kingdom the United States and Russia have taken this approach while Western European states generally do not Another major method of preemptive neutralization is interrogation of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots targets the identity of other terrorists whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase suggestibility such as sleep deprivation or drugs Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment or due to the confusion brought on by it These methods are not tolerated by European powers In 1978 the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the Ireland v United Kingdom case that such methods amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment and that such practices were in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights Article 3 art 3 Nonmilitary The human security paradigm outlines a nonmilitary approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and sustainability for all people Such activities empower citizens providing freedom from fear and freedom from want This can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water education vaccination programs provision of food and shelter and protection from violence military or otherwise Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments NGOs and citizens Foreign internal defense programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government FID can involve both nonmilitary and military aspects of counterterrorism Military Terrorism has often been used to justify military intervention in countries like Pakistan where terrorists are said to be based That was the main stated justification for the US invasion of Afghanistan It was also a stated justification for the second Russian invasion of Chechnya Military intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism like during the Malayan Emergency the Mau Mau uprising and most of the campaigns against the IRA during the Irish Civil War the SPlan the Border Campaign IRA and the Troubles in Northern Ireland Although military action can disrupt a terrorist groups operations temporarily it sometimes doesnt end the threat completely Thus repression by the military in itself particularly if it is not accompanied by other measures usually leads to short term victories but tend to be unsuccessful in the long run eg the Frenchs doctrine described in Roger Trinquiers book Modern War used in Indochina and Algeria However new methods see the new Counterinsurgency Field Manual such as those taken in Iraq have yet to be seen as beneficial or ineffectual Preparation Police fire and emergency medical response organizations have obvious roles Local firefighters and emergency medical personnel often called first responders have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks although police may deal with threats of such attacks Targethardening Whatever the target of terrorists there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark or reducing the damage of attacks One method is to place Jersey Barrier or other sturdy obstacles outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and truck bombing Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation Aircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights and have reinforced doors which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening UK railway stations removed their rubbish bins in response to the Provisional IRA threat as convenient locations for depositing bombs Scottish stations removed theirs after the 7 July 2005 London Bombings as a precautionary measure The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority purchased bombresistant barriers after the September 11 terrorist attacks A more sophisticated targethardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the Bhopal disaster or the Halifax Explosion Industrial chemicals in manufacturing shipping and storage need greater protection and some efforts are in progress To put this risk into perspective the first major lethal chemical attack in WWI used 160 tons of chlorine Industrial shipments of chlorine widely used in water purification and the chemical industry travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars To give one more example the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated in the Northeast Blackout of 2003 its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate possibly insecure SCADA supervisory control and data acquisition networks Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional powerselling between utilities A small number of terrorists attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers could wreak havoc Equipping likely targets with containers ie bags of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by Islamist suicide bombers The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s The approach stems from the idea that Muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be soiled by the lard in the moment prior to dying The idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in Israel However the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a fatwa proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products Command and control In North America and other continents for a threatened or completed terrorist attack the Incident Command System ICS is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response ICS has varied levels of escalation such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area eg the 2005 bombings in London or the 2004 Madrid train bombings or all the way to a National Response Plan invocation if nationallevel resources are needed National response for example might be needed for a nuclear biological radiological or large chemical attack Damage mitigation Fire departments perhaps supplemented by public works agencies utility providers eg gas water electricity and heavy construction contractors are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack Local security Again under an incident command model local police can isolate the incident area reducing confusion and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists often using specialized counterterrorist tactical units Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level Medical services Emergency medical services will triage treat and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals which will also need to have mass casualty and triage plans in place Public health agencies from local to national level may be designated to deal with identification and sometimes mitigation of possible biological attacks and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination Tactical units Today many countries have special units designated to handle terrorist threats Besides various security agencies there are elite tactical units also known as special mission units whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks Such units perform both in preventive actions hostage rescue and responding to ongoing attacks Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counterterrorist teams Tactics techniques and procedures for manhunting are under constant development Most of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area or threaten to do so It is far harder to deal with assassination or even reprisals on individuals due to the short if any warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins These units are specially trained in tactics and are very well equipped for CQB with emphasis on stealth and performing the mission with minimal casualties The units include takeover force assault teams snipers EOD experts dog handlers and intelligence officers See Counterintelligence and counterterrorism organizations for national command intelligence and incident mitigation The majority of counterterrorism operations at the tactical level are conducted by state federal and national law enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies In some countries the military may be called in as a last resort Obviously for countries whose military are legally permitted to conduct police operations this is a nonissue and such counterterrorism operations are conducted by their military See counterintelligence for command intelligence and warning and incident mitigation aspects of counterterror Examples of actions Some counterterrorist actions of the 20th and 21st century are listed below See list of hostage crises for a more extended list including hostagetaking that did not end violently Designing Antiterrorism systems The scope for Antiterrorism systems is very large in physical terms long borders vast areas high traffic volumes in busy cities etc as well as in other dimensions such as type and degree of terrorism threat political and diplomatic ramifications and legal issues In this environment the development of a persistent Antiterrorism protection system is a daunting task Such a system should bring together diverse stateoftheart technologies to enable persistent intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions and enable potential actions Designing such a systemofsystems comprises a major technological project A particular design problem for this system is that it will face many uncertainties in the future The threat of terrorism may increase decrease or remain the same the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict and there are technological uncertainties Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more A potential solution is to incorporate flexibility into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as uncertainty unfolds and updated information arrives And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario but an array of scenarios Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available Using these real options will create a flexible Antiterrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise Law enforcementPolice While some countries with longstanding terrorism problems such as Israel have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks in other nations counterterrorism is a relatively more recent objective of civilian police and law enforcement agencies While some civillibertarians and criminal justice scholars have calledout efforts of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism as futile and expensive or as threats to civil liberties other scholars have begun describing and analyzing the most important dimensions of the policing of terrorism as an important dimension of counterterrorism especially in the post911 era and have argued how police institutions view terrorism as a matter of crime control Such analyses bring out the civilian police role in counterterrorism next to the military model of a war on terror CounterTerrorism and American Law Enforcement Pursuant to passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 federal state and local law enforcement agencies began to systemically reorganize Two primary federal agencies the Department of Justice DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security DHS house most of the federal agencies that are prepared to combat domestic and international terrorist attacks These include the Border Patrol the Secret Service the Coast Guard and the FBI Following suit from federal changes pursuant to 911 however most state and local law enforcement agencies began to include a commitment to fighting terrorism in their mission statements Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies Some scholars have doubted the ability of local police to help in the war on terror and suggest their limited manpower is still best utilized by engaging community and targeting street crimes While counterterror measures most notably heightened airport security immigrant profiling and border patrol have been adapted during the last decade to enhance counterterror in law enforcement there have been remarkable limitations to assessing the actual utilityeffectiveness of law enforcement practices that are ostensibly preventative Thus while sweeping changes in counterterrorism rhetoric redefined most American post 911 law enforcement agencies in theory it is hard to assess how well such hyperbole has translated into practice In intelligenceled policingILP efforts the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy ie Neighborhood Watch Gun Abatement Foot Patrols etc is usually to assess total financial costs against clearance rates or arrest rates Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a nongeneralizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness Another methodological problem in assessing counterterrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible International CounterTerrorism Agencies indicates military organization allowed to operate domestically Albania RENEA Argentina GEOF Special

counterterrorism tasks national military organizations do not generally have dedicated units whose sole responsibility is the prosecution of these tasks Instead the counterterrorism function is an element of the role allowing flexibility in their employment with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context In some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena United States Department of Defense policy based on the Posse Comitatus Act forbids domestic counterterrorism operations by the US military Units allocated some operational counterterrorism task are frequently Special Forces or similar assets In cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations such as the Iranian Embassy Siege the British police formally
