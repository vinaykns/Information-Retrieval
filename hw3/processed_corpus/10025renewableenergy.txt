 The endeavor to use 100 renewable energy for electricity heating and cooling and transport is motivated by global warming pollution and other environmental issues as well as economic and energy security concerns Shifting the total global primary energy supply to renewable sources requires a transition of the energy system In 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated In 2014 renewable sources such as wind geothermal solar biomass and burnt waste provided 19 of the total energy consumed worldwide with roughly half of that coming from traditional use of biomass The most important sector is electricity with a renewable share of 228 most of it coming from hydropower with a share of 166 followed by wind with 31 There are many places around the world with grids that are run almost exclusively on renewable energy At the national level at least 30 nations already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of the energy supply Professors S Pacala and Robert H Socolow of Princeton University have developed a series of “Climate stabilization wedges” that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and renewable energy sources in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges Mark Z Jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy program says that producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic Jacobson says that energy costs today with a wind solar and water system should be similar to todays energy costs from other optimally costeffective strategies The main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will Similarly in the United States the independent National Research Council has noted that “sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand The main barriers to the widespread implementation of largescale renewable energy and lowcarbon energy strategies are political rather than technological According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints History Using 100 renewable energy was first suggested in a Science paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist Bent Sørensen which was followed by several other proposals In 1976 energy policy analyst Amory Lovins coined the term soft energy path to describe an alternative future where energy efficiency and appropriate renewable energy sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels In 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published These were followed by the first detailed 100 scenarios In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100 renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europa and North Africa In the same year Danish Energy professor Henrik Lund published a first paper in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100 renewable energy in Denmark Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100 renewable energy After 2009 publications began to rise steeply covering 100 scenarios for countries in Europa America Australia and other parts of the world Even in the early 21st century it was extraordinary for scientists and decisionmakers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity However renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then Solar photovoltaic modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price Current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation Onshore wind power is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions Concentrated solar thermal power CST with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated Wind turbines generate 39 percent of Danish electricity and Denmark has many biogas digesters and wastetoenergy plants as well Together wind and biomass provide 44 of the electricity consumed by the countrys six million inhabitants In 2010 Portugal’s 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources Spain’s 40 million inhabitants meet onethird of their electrical needs from renewables Renewable energy has a history of strong public support In America for example a 2013 Gallup survey showed that two in three Americans want the US to increase domestic energy production using solar power 76 wind power 71 and natural gas 65 Far fewer want more petroleum production 46 and more nuclear power 37 Least favored is coal with about one in three Americans favouring it REN21 says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this At the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longerterm shares of renewable energy including a binding 20 by 2020 target for the European Union Some countries have much higher longterm policy targets of up to 100 renewables Outside Europe a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10 to 50 Nuclear power involves substantial accident risks eg Fukushima nuclear disaster Chernobyl disaster and the unsolved problem of safe longterm highlevel radioactive waste management and carbon capture and storage has rather limited safe storage potentials These constraints have also led to an interest in 100 renewable energy A well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade evaluating scenarios for 100 renewable energy for various geographical areas In recent years more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources The incentive to use 100 renewable energy is created by global warming and ecological as well as economic concerns post peak oil The first country to propose 100 renewable energy was Iceland in 1998 Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003 and for Australia in 2011 Albania Iceland and Paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources Albania and Paraguay 100 from hydroelectricity Iceland 72 hydro and 28 geothermal Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources 97 percent from hydropower Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet Australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity The road map for the United States commitment by Denmark and Vision 2050 for Europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100 renewable energy later reduced to 2040 in 2011 Zero Carbon Britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in Britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy In 2015 Hawaii enacted a law that the Renewable Portfolio Standard shall be 100 percent by 2045 This is often confused with renewable energy If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh Then the RPS is 115 percent It is estimated that the world will spend an extra 8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of nonrenewable resources a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100 renewable energy Research that has been published in Energy Policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100 renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable but requires political support It would require building many more wind turbines and solar power systems but wouldnt utilize bioenergy Other changes involve use of electric cars and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage Recent developments The Fourth Revolution Energy is a German documentary film released in 2010 It shows the vision of a global society which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100 with renewable energies showing a complete reconstruction of the economy to reach this goal In 2011 Hermann Scheer wrote the book The Energy Imperative 100 Percent Renewable Now published by Routledge Reinventing Fire is a book by Amory Lovins released in October 2011 By combining reduced energy use with energy efficiency gains Lovins says that there will be a 5 trillion saving and a fastergrowing economy This can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energysaving technologies through market forces led by business Bill Clinton says the book is a wise detailed and comprehensive blueprint The first paragraph of the preface says Imagine fuel without fear No climate change No oil spills dead coal miners dirty air devastated lands lost wildlife No energy poverty No oilfed wars tyrannies or terrorists Nothing to run out Nothing to cut off Nothing to worry about Just energy abundance benign and affordable for all for ever The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand In a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17 of total energy by 2030 and 27 by 2050 the highest forecast projected 43 supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77 by 2050 In 2011 the International Energy Agency has said that solar energy technologies in its many forms can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces The development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longerterm benefits It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly importindependent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise These advantages are global Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared In 2011 the refereed journal Energy Policy published two articles by Mark Z Jacobson a professor of engineering at Stanford University and research scientist Mark A Delucchi about changing our energy supply mix and Providing all global energy with wind water and solar power The articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power transportation and heatingcooling from wind water and sunlight WWS which are safe clean options In Part I Jacobson and Delucchi discuss WWS energy system characteristics aspects of energy demand WWS resource availability WWS devices needed and material requirements They estimate that 3800000 5 MW wind turbines 5350 100 MW geothermal power plants and 270 new 1300 MW hydroelectric power plants will be required In terms of solar power an additional 49000 300 MW concentrating solar plants 40000 300 MW solar photovoltaic power plants and 17 billion 3 kW rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed Such an extensive WWS infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30 In Part II Jacobson and Delucchi address variability of supply system economics and energy policy initiatives associated with a WWS system The authors advocate producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050 Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic Energy costs with a WWS system should be similar to todays energy costs In general Jacobson has said wind water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the worlds energy eliminating all fossil fuels He advocates a smart mix of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps A 2012 study by the University of Delaware for a 72 GW system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most costeffective for the PJM Interconnection would use 17 GW of solar 68 GW of offshore wind and 115 GW of onshore wind although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided 01 of the time would require generation from other sources In March 2012 Denmarks parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity heat and fuels from renewables by 2050 IRENEC is an annual conference on 100 renewable energy started in 2011 by Eurosolar Turkey The 2013 conference was in Istanbul More recently Jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100 renewable energy produced by wind water and sunlight for New York California and Washington states by 2050 As of 2014 a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states The 50state plan is part of The Solutions Project an independent outreach effort led by Jacobson actor Mark Ruffalo and film director Josh Fox As of 2014 many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind solar biomass biofuel hydro ocean and geothermal energy Debate over detailed plans remain but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable economically feasible socially viable and so realisable This prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by Germany one of the worlds most successful industrial economies to undertake a major energy transition Energiewende In 2015 a study was published in Energy and Environmental Science that describes a pathway to 100 renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable as by 2050 it would save about 600 Billion Dollars health costs a year due to reduced air pollution and 33 Trillion global warming costs This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around 8300 compared to a business as usual pathway According to that study barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political as most people didnt know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs Places with around 100 renewable electricity The following places meet 90 or more of their average yearly electricity demand with renewable energy Some other places have high percentages for example the electricity sector in Denmark as of 2014 is 40 wind power with plans in place to reach 85 The electricity sector in Canada and the electricity sector in New Zealand have even higher percentages 65 and 75 respectively and Austria is approaching 70 As of 2015 the electricity sector in Germany sometimes meets almost 100 of the electricity demand with PV and wind power and renewable electricity is over 25 Albania has 948 of installed capacity as hydroelectric 52 diesel generator but Albania imports 39 of its electricity In 2016 Portugal achieved 100 renewable electricity for four days between 7 May and 11 May partly because efficient energy use had reduced electricity demand France and Sweden have low carbon intensity since they predominately use a mixture of nuclear power and hydroelectricity Although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification For example electric cars achieve much better miles per gallon equivalent than fossil fuel cars and another example is renewable heat such as in the case of Denmark which is proposing to move to greater use of heat pumps for heating buildings which provide multiple kilowatts of heat per kilowatt of electricity Obstacles The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of largescale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies at the pace required to prevent runaway climate change are primarily political and not technological According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are Climate change denial Efforts to impede renewable energy by the fossil fuel industry Political paralysis Unsustainable consumption of energy and resources Path dependencies and outdated infrastructure Financial and governance constraints NASA Climate scientist James Hansen discusses the problem with rapid phase out of fossil fuels and said that while it is conceivable in places such as New Zealand and Norway suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States China India or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy In 2013 Smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solargenerated electricity including the proposals of Jacobson and colleagues and writing in an issue of Spectrum prepared by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers he identified numerous points of concern such as cost intermittent power supply growing NIMBYism and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that History and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed Smil and Hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power but American physicist Amory Lovins has said that the electricity grid can cope just as it routinely backs up nonworking coalfired and nuclear plants with working ones In 1999 American academic Dr Gregory Unruh published a dissertation identifying the systemic barriers to the adoption and diffusion of renewable energy technologies This theoretical framework was called Carbon Lockin and pointed to the creation of selfreinforcing feedbacks that arise through the coevolution of large technological systems like electricity and transportation networks with the social and political institutions that support and benefit from system growth Once established these technoinstitutional complexes become lockedin and resist efforts to transform them towards more environmentally sustainable systems based on renewable sources Lester R Brown founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute a nonprofit research organization based in Washington DC says a rapid transition to 100 renewable energy is both possible and necessary Brown compares with the US entry into World War II and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the US industry and economy A quick transition to 100 renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by Brown to follow an approach with similar urgency The International Energy Agency says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production The issue of intermittent supply applies to popular renewable technologies mainly wind power and solar photovoltaics and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system as well as the demand side flexibility Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when dispatchable generation such as hydroelectricity or solar thermal storage is also available But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management and additional costs may be required for backup or system modification Renewable electricity supply in the 2050 penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system In 2011 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the worlds leading climate researchers selected by the United Nations said as infrastructure and energy systems develop in spite of the complexities there are few if any fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied IPCC scenarios generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world The IPCC said that if governments were supportive and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed renewable energy supply could account for almost 80 of the worlds energy use within forty years Rajendra Pachauri chairman of the IPCC said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1 of global GDP annually This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible In November 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out with their fifth report saying that in the absence of any one technology such as bioenergy carbon dioxide capture and storage nuclear wind and solar climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent For example it may cost 40 more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture Table 32 Google spent 30 million on their REC project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change The project was cancelled after concluding that a bestcase scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050 See also Renewable energy portal Catching the Sun film Energy transition Energy transition in Germany Germany National
