the Henry Ford Company on November 3 1901 which became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22 1902 after Ford left with the rights to his name The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with 28000 in cash from twelve investors most notably John and Horace Dodge who would later found their own car company During its early years the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit Michigan Groups of two or three men worked on each car assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford Within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept and Ford soon brought much of the part production inhouse in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company which would go on to become one of the worlds largest and most profitable companies It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest familycontrolled companies in the world The first gasoline powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Carl Benz Benz PatentMotorwagen More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class to which Ford contributed by for instance introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park Between 1903 and 1908 Ford produced the Models A B C F K N R and S Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year In 1908 Ford introduced the massproduced Model T which totalled millions sold over nearly 20 years In 1927 Ford replaced the T with the Model A the first car with safety glass in the windshield Ford launched the first lowpriced car with a V8 engine in 1932 In an attempt to compete with General Motors midpriced Pontiac Oldsmobile and Buick Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higherpriced companion car to Ford Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922 in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market In 1929 Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile Plant in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialisation of that country The creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn Michigan in 1951 doing unfettered basic research led to Fords unlikely involvement in superconductivity research In 1964 Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID Ford offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956 which included such innovations as a standard deepdish steering wheel optional front and for the first time in a car rear seatbelts and an optional padded dash Ford introduced childproof door locks into its products in 1957 and in the same year offered the first retractable hardtop on a massproduced sixseater car In late 1955 Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II At the same time the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster Ford merged Lincoln Mercury and Edsel into MEL which reverted to LincolnMercury after Edsels November 1959 demise The Ford Mustang was introduced in 1964 In 1965 Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light With the 1980s Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world During the 1980s Ford began using the advertising slogan Have you driven a Ford lately to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern In 1990 and 1994 respectively Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin During the mid to late 1990s Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices With the dawn of the new century legacy healthcare costs higher fuel prices and a faltering economy led to falling market shares declining sales and diminished profit margins Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company 21st century By 2005 both Ford and GMs corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status as a result of high US health care costs for an aging workforce soaring gasoline prices eroding market share and an over dependence on declining SUV sales Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased incentives in the form of rebates or low interest financing to offset declining demand In the latter half of 2005 Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability Fields previewed the Plan named The Way Forward at the December 7 2005 board meeting of the company and it was unveiled to the public on January 23 2006 The Way Forward included resizing the company to match market realities dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models consolidating production lines closing 14 factories and cutting 30000 jobs Ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles including Crossover SUVs built on unibody car platforms rather than more bodyonframe chassis In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV Ford licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies to avoid patent infringements Ford announced that it will team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison SCE to examine the future of plugin hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid Under the multimilliondollar multiyear project Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plugin hybrids and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utilitys electrical grid Some of the vehicles will be evaluated in typical customer settings according to Ford William Clay Ford Jr greatgrandson of Henry Ford and better known by his nickname Bill was appointed Executive Chairman in 1998 and also became Chief Executive Officer of the company in 2001 with the departure of Jacques Nasser becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle Henry Ford II in 1982 Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004 the start of a decrease in Fords motorsport involvement Upon the retirement of President and Chief Operation Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006 Bill Ford assumed his roles as well Five months later in September Ford named Alan Mulally as President and CEO with Ford continuing as Executive Chairman In December 2006 the company raised its borrowing capacity to about 25 billion placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral Chairman Bill Ford has stated that bankruptcy is not an option Ford and the United Auto Workers representing approximately 46000 hourly workers in North America agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues The agreement included the establishment of a companyfunded independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association VEBA trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the companys books thereby improving its balance sheet This arrangement took effect on January 1 2010 As a sign of its currently strong cash position Ford contributed its entire current liability estimated at approximately US55 billion as of December 31 2009 to the VEBA in cash and also prepaid US500 million of its future liabilities to the fund The agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories The automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of 127 billion and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009 However Ford surprised Wall Street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a 750 million profit Despite the gains the company finished the year with a 27 billion loss largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo On June 2 2008 Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for 23 billion During congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington DC and in a show of support Fords Alan Mulally stated that We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions Mulally went on to state that The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford and that Ford Motor Companys supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis Together the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry Mulally stated that In addition to our plan we are also here today to request support for the industry In the nearterm Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan However we request a credit line of 9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through TARP legislation funding provisions On December 19 the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent the sum insured for five years in addition to annual payments of 5 percent That meant 68 million paid upfront to insure 10 million in debt in addition to payments of 500000 per year In January 2009 Ford reported a 146 billion loss in the preceding year a record for the company The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations Through April 2009 Fords strategy of debt for equity exchanges erased 99 billion in liabilities 28 of its total in order to leverage its cash position These actions yielded Ford a 27 billion profit in fiscal year 2009 the companys first fullyear profit in four years In 2012 Fords corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again citing sustainable lasting improvements On October 29 2012 Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business its last remaining automotive components operation to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price On November 1 2012 Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally will stay with the company until 2014 Ford also named Mark Fields the president of operations in Americas as its new chief operating officer Fords CEO Mulally was paid a compensation of over 174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006 The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company On January 3 2017 Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a vote of confidence because of the probusiness climate being fostered in part by Presidentelect Donald Trump Ford has cancelled plans to invest 16 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus The Ford Focus will now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico Instead Fields announced that Ford will be investing 700 million in Michigan which it plans to use to create 700 new jobs In February 2017 Ford

agreement with Russian automaker GAZ North America In the first five months of 2010 auto sales in the US rose to 46 million cars and light trucks an increase of 17 from a year earlier The rise was mainly caused by the return of commercial customers that had all but stopped buying in 2009 during the recession Sales to individual customers at dealerships have increased 13 while fleet sales have jumped 32 Ford reported that 37 of its sales in May came from fleet sales when it announced its sales for the month increased 23 In the first seven months of 2010 vehicle sales of Ford increased 24 including retail and fleet sales Fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35 to 386000 units while retail sales increase 19 Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chryslers sales and 31 percent for GMs Europe Main article Ford of Europe At first Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built different models from one another until the late 1960s with the Ford Escort and then the Ford Capri being common to both companies Later on the Ford Taunus and Ford Cortina became identical produced in left hand drive and right hand drive respectively Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982 drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling which was soon given nicknames the Jellymould and The Salesmans Spaceship In February 2002 Ford ended car production in the UK It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain although production of the Transit van continued at the companys Southampton facility until mid2013 engines at Bridgend and Dagenham and transmissions at Halewood Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex powertrain FiestaKa and commercial vehicles and Cologne body chassis electrical Focus Mondeo in Germany Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles although the use of this brand name was discontinued circa 1965 Elsewhere in continental Europe Ford assembles the Mondeo range in Genk Belgium Fiesta in Valencia Spain and Cologne Germany Ka in Valencia Spain Focus in Valencia Spain Saarlouis Germany and Vsevolozhsk Russia Transit production is in Kocaeli Turkey Southampton UK and Transit Connect in Kocaeli Turkey Ford also owns a jointventure production plant in Turkey Ford Otosan established in the 1970s manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the Jumbo and longwheelbase versions of the fullsize Transit This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002 and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk Another joint venture plant near Setúbal in Portugal set up in collaboration with Volkswagen formerly assembled the Galaxy peoplecarrier as well as its sister ships the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy Ford has moved the production of the peoplecarrier to the Genk plant with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Setúbal facility In 2008 Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova Romania Starting 2009 the Ford Transit Connect was Fords first model produced in Craiova followed in 2012 by lowcapacity car engines and a new small class car the BMax Its 1959 Anglia twodoor saloon was one of the most quirkylooking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967 The third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the companys move from rearwheel drive saloons to frontwheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector The fourth generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000 although its successor – the Focus – had been on sale since 1998 On its launch the Focus was arguably the most dramaticlooking and finehandling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation Focus at the end of 2004 The 1982 Ford Sierra – replacement for the longrunning and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models – was a stylesetter at the time of its launch Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy sharpedged Cortina and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the frontwheel drive Mondeo at the start of 1993 The rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the minicar market in 1976 with its Fiesta hatchback Most of its production was concentrated at Valencia in Spain and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start An update in 1983 and the launch of an allnew model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market On October 24 2012 Ford announced that it would be closing its Genk assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014 East and Southeast Asia Ford formed its first passengervehicle joint venture in China in 2001 six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW It has spent as of 2013 49 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600000 vehicles This includes Fords largestever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing Ford had 25 of the Chinese market in 2013 while VW controlled 145 and GM had 156 according to consultant LMC Automotive GM outsells Ford in China by more than sixtoone Fords presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller confined to Malaysia Singapore Hong Kong the Philippines and Taiwan where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960 but withdrew from the country in 1976 and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance Now based in the Bowin Sub District of the Sriracha District in Chonburi the factory still produces passenger automobiles The factory built in 1941 in Singapore was shortly taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese at the factory site which is now a national monument in Singapore On April 30 2013 Ford Motor Co launched their car and truck line in Myanmar Previously heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar but due to currency reform lifting of previous import restrictions and the abolishment of shadow currency Myanmars car market had grown in demand Ford of Korea In 1967 Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai and at the new factory in Ulsan South Korea built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their allnew Hyundai Pony in 1975 Ford then developed a relationship with Koreas oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles coengineered with Mazda later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988–1993 and the Ford Aspire from 1994–1997 for export to the United States With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979 Ford began selling Mazdas Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region replacing the Europeansourced Escort and Cortina Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997 and in 1998 Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51 of the company outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986 After subsequent divestments Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50 of the company but remains Kias largest stakeholder Ford currently sells the Focus and Mondeo with diesel engines plus the Mustang Taurus Escape and Explorer as well as the Lincoln MKS MKZ and MKC South and West Asia Ford India began production in 1998 at Chennai Tamil Nadu with its Ford Escort model which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001 It has since added the Fusion Fiesta Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line On March 9 2010 Ford Motor Co launched its first madeforIndia compact car Starting at ₹349900 the Figo was Fords first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market On July 28 2011 Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding MoU with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand and planned to invest approximately US1 billion on a 460acre site Fords market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region Saudi Arabia Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment Fords distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986 Half of the FordLincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias In 2004 Ford sold 30000 units in the region falling far short of General Motors 88852 units and Nissan Motors 75000 units South America During much of the 20th century Ford faced protectionist government measures in South America with the result that it built different models in different countries without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations In many cases new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with or whose factories it had acquired For example the Corcel and Del Rey in Brazil were originally based on Renault vehicles In 1987 Ford of Brazil and Ford of Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group forming a new jointventure company called Autolatina with a shared model range Sales figures and profitability were disappointing and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995 With the advent of Mercosur the regional common market Ford was finally able to rationalize its product lineups in those countries Consequently the Ford Fiesta and Ford EcoSport are only built in Brazil and the Ford Focus only built in Argentina with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries Models like the Ford Mondeo from Europe could now be imported completely built up Ford of Brazil produces a pickup truck version of the Fiesta the Courier which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in right hand drive versions Africa In Africa Fords market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its Port Elizabeth facility Later Ford sourced its models from the UK and Australia with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6 with a 30 V6 engine and a Cortinabased bakkie or pickup which was exported to the UK In the mid1980s Ford merged with a rival company owned by Anglo American to form the South African Motor Corporation Samcor Following international condemnation of apartheid Ford divested from South Africa in 1988 and sold its stake in Samcor although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well which affected its product lineup and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazdabased Laser and Telstar Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994 and this later became once again a wholly owned subsidiary the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta also built in India and Mexico and the Focus The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa but was dropped in 2003 while the Mondeo after briefly being assembled locally was dropped in 2005 The Mondeo has since been reintroduced but badged as the Fusion Former operations East and Southeast Asia Ford decided to shut down their entire operations in Indonesia including their dealer network by second half of 2016 Ford of Japan Ford established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925 where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported knockdown kits The factory subsequently produced 10000 Model As up to 1936 Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States After World War II Ford did not have a presence in Japan as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda In 1979 Ford acquired a 245 ownership stake in Mazda and in 1982 Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan including vehicles manufactured in North America at a dealership called Autorama Japanese The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997 Vehicles sold at Autorama locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer Probe 1989–1998 Mustang Taurus 1989–1997 Thunderbird 1990–1993 Lincoln Continental and Lincoln LS Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo Ka Focus Focus CMAX Fiesta and the Galaxy Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations They were the Ford Telstar Mazda Capella Laser Festiva Festiva Mini Wagon Ixion Mazda Premacy Freda Mazda Bongo Friendee Spectron Mazda Bongo and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 Mazda Bongo truck Ford increased its shareholding in Mazda to 334 in 1996 but as of July 2016 it is listed at 11 Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan as of October 2010 the Ford Mustang Escape Explorer and Explorer truck Ford Kuga Lincoln Navigator Lincoln MKX and more recently the Ford Ecosport were available in Japan As of February 2016 Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato Tokyo Japan and sales of new cars in Japan have ended Oceania In Australia and New Zealand the popular Ford Falcon 1960–2016 had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo Fords largest car sold in Europe Between 1960 and 1972 the Falcon was based on a US model of the same name but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016 occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand Like its General Motors rival the Holden Commodore the Falcon used a rear wheel drive layout Highperformance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362 hp 270 kW A ute short for utility known in the US as pickup truck version is also available with the same range of drivetrains In addition Ford Australia sells highly tuned limitedproduction Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division Ford Performance Vehicles until it closed in 2014 In Australia the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and comprise over 20 of the new car market In New Zealand Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 144 More recently Ford has axed its Falconbased LWB variant of its lineup– the Fairlane and LTD ranges Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008 Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant may be shut down from 2013 which it did in 2016 They have also announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011 nothing came of that plan In Australia the Laser was one of Ford Australias most successful models and was manufactured in Fords Homebush plant from 1981 until the plants closure in September 1994 It outsold the Mazda 323 despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand In New Zealand the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997 at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand VANZ plant in Wiri Auckland The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market The scheduled closure of Fords Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23 2013 Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows the company had registered losses worth AU600 million over the five years prior to the announcement It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for twothirds of large local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Fords products profitable and viable in Australia The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers—over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows—who will lose their jobs by October 2016 The closure of Fords plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7 2016 Products and services Automobiles See also List of Ford vehicles List of Lincoln vehicles and

Many of todays racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category Environmental initiatives Compressed natural gas The alternative fossil fuel vehicles such as some versions of the Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service operate on compressed natural gas—or CNG Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks – one for gasoline the other for CNG – the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch Flexible fuel vehicles Flexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available ethanol fuel mixtures—from pure gasoline to bioethanolgasoline blends such as E85 85 ethanol and 15 gasoline or E100 neat hydrous ethanol in Brazil Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the US is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier Ford EcoSport Ford Fiesta Ford Focus and Ford Ka Electric drive vehicles
