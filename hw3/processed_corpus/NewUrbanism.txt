 Neotraditionalism redirects here For other uses see Neotraditional New Urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types It arose in the United States in the early 1980s and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development urban planning and municipal landuse strategies New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design TND and transitoriented development TOD These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices The organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism founded in 1993 Its foundational text is the Charter of the New Urbanism which begins We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history climate ecology and building practice New Urbanists support regional planning for open space contextappropriate architecture and planning adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities libraries and community centres and the balanced development of jobs and housing They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes walk or take the train They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl The Charter of the New Urbanism also covers issues such as historic preservation safe streets green building and the redevelopment of brownfield land The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches Architecturally new urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical postmodern or vernacular styles although that is not always the case Background Until the mid 20th century cities were generally organized into and developed around mixeduse walkable neighborhoods For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car Specifically after World War II urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development and focused on the construction of lowdensity singlefamily detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class The physical separation of where people live from where they work shop and frequently spend their recreational time together with low housing density which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency This new system of development with its rigorous separation of uses arose after World War II and became known as conventional suburban development or pejoratively as urban sprawl The majority of US citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last fifty years and automobile use per capita has soared Although New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the modernist planning techniques being put into practice Social philosopher and historian Lewis Mumford criticized the antiurban development of postwar America The Death and Life of Great American Cities written by Jane Jacobs in the early 1960s called for planners to reconsider the singleuse housing projects large cardependent thoroughfares and segregated commercial centers that had become the norm The French architect François Spoerry has developed in the 60s the concept of soft architecture that he applied to Port Grimaud a new marina in south of France The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like Port Liberté in New Jersey or Le Plessis Robisson in France Rooted in these early dissenters the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the European city proposed by architect Leon Krier and the pattern language theories of Christopher Alexander The term new urbanism itself started being used in this context in the mid1980s but it wasnt until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized In 1991 the Local Government Commission a private nonprofit group in Sacramento California invited architects Peter Calthorpe Michael Corbett Andrés Duany Elizabeth Moule Elizabeth PlaterZyberk Stefanos Polyzoides and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning Named the Ahwahnee Principles after Yosemite National Parks Ahwahnee Hotel the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991 at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials Calthorpe Duany Moule PlaterZyberk Polyzoides and Solomon founded the Chicagobased Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993 The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles It holds annual Congresses in various US cities In 2009 cofounders Elizabeth Moule Hank Dittmar and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability The Canons are a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building the making of community and the conservation of our natural world They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions the use of locally obtained materials and in general a culture of permanence New Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning architecture and public policy Defining elements Andrés Duany and Elizabeth PlaterZyberk two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism observed mixeduse streetscapes with corner shops front porches and a diversity of wellcrafted housing while living in one of the Victorian neighborhoods of New Haven Connecticut They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following The neighborhood has a discernible center This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner A transit stop would be located at this center Most of the dwellings are within a fiveminute walk of the center an average of roughly 025 miles 040 km There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses rowhouses and apartments — so that younger and older people singles and families the poor and the wealthy may find places to live At the edge of the neighborhood there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household A small ancillary building or garage apartment is permitted within the backyard of each house It may be used as a rental unit or place to work for example an office or craft workshop An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees This slows traffic creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street creating a welldefined outdoor room Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings usually accessed by alleys Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings These provide sites for community meetings education and religious or cultural activities Terminology Several terms are viewed either as synonymous included in or overlapping with the New Urbanism The terms Neotraditional Development or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods often built in traditional architectural styles as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the new moniker The term Walkable Urbanism was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger Many debate whether Smart Growth and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of likeminded groups The term TransitOriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists The term Sustainable development is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s however this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the United Nations and Agenda 21 to include human development issues eg developing country that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or Sustainable Urbanism The term livability or livable communities was popular under the Obama administration though it dates back at least to the mid1990s when the term was used by the Local Government Commission Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of urbanisms in an article in 2011 titled A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including Sustainable Urbanism and Tactical Urbanism of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the coauthors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide In 2011 Andres Duany authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturallyfocused subset of New Urbanist town design In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU cofounder Andres Duany began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast alternative to or a refinement of the New Urbanism Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford John Chase and John Kaliski Ecological Urbanism and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich Landscape urbanism was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism Michael E Arth promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the New Pedestrianism which is intended to be more pedestrianoriented and traces its origins to a 1929 planned community in Radburn New Jersey Organizations The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the Congress for the New Urbanism CNU The Congress for the New Urbanism CNU is the leading organization promoting walkable mixeduse neighborhood development sustainable communities and healthier living conditions CNU members promote the principles of CNUs Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism including Livable streets arranged in compact walkable blocks A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels Schools stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking bicycling or transit service An affirming humanscaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in Alexandria Virginia with approximately one hundred attendees By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more As of 2013 Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters one in Ontario CNU Ontario and one in British Columbia Cascadia which also includes a portion of the northwest US states While the CNU has international participation in Canada sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism CEU the Movement for Israeli Urbanism MIU and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the Savannah College of Art and Design University of Georgia University of Notre Dame and the University of Miami In 2003 a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington DC and began developing a Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists The Next Generation of New Urbanists held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004 The group has continued meeting annually as of 2014 with a focus on young professionals students new member issues and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first Tactical Urbanism Guide The CNU has spawned publications and research groups Publications include the New Urban News and the New Town Paper Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the FormBased Codes Institute The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies In the United Kingdom New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by the The Princes Foundation for the Built Environment Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit such as INTBAU A Vision of Europe and others The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with likeminded groups Organizations under the banner of Smart Growth also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the United States Green Building Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop the LEED for Neighborhood Development standards and with the Institute of Transportation Engineers to develop a Context Sensitive Solutions CSS Design manual Film The New Urbanism Film Festival was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics The 2011 film Urbanized by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen DunhamJones and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States The 2004 documentary The End of Suburbia Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawltype development New Urban Cowboy Toward a New Pedestrianism a feature length 2008 documentary about urban designer Michael E Arth explains the principles of his New Pedestrianism a more ecological and pedestrianoriented version of New Urbanism The film also gives a brief history of New Urbanism and chronicles the rebuilding of an inner city slum into a model of New Pedestrianism and New Urbanism called The Garden District Criticism New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the political spectrum It has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers In an interview in Reason a rightlibertarian magazine professor Peter Gordon a professor of Urban Planning from University of Southern California spoke in favor of suburbanization stating that the New Urbanism ignores consumer preference and that cities have moved towards caroriented development because that is what people want On the other hand journalist Alex Marshall has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty aspirational slogans In a 1996 article in Metropolis Magazine Marshall denounced New Urbanism as a grand fraud The attack continued in numerous articles including an opinion column in the Washington Post in September of the same year and in Marshalls first book How Cities Work Suburbs Sprawl and the Roads Not Taken Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixedincome developments but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking cycling and public transport The Charter of the New Urbanism states that communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of carfree developments Michael E Arth proposes new pedestrianism as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrianonly paths Steve Melia proposes the idea of filtered permeability see Permeability spatial and transport planning which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanisms claimed environmental benefits a rating system for neighborhood environmental design LEEDND was developed by the US Green Building Council Natural Resources Defense Council and the Congress for the New Urbanism to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design New Urbanist and board member of CNU Doug Farr has taken a step further and coined Sustainable Urbanism which combines New Urbanism and LEEDND to create walkable transitserved urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned largescale development instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions Examples Main article Examples of New Urbanism United States New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow At least fourteen largescale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and landuse policies and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region Miami Florida has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanistbased zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major US city More than six hundred new towns villages and neighborhoods following New Urbanist principles have been planned or are currently under construction in the US Hundreds of new smallscale urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks In Maryland and several other states New Urbanist principles are an integral part of smart growth legislation In the mid1990s the US Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibilliondollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations Most were driven by the private sector but many including HUD projects used public money University Place in Memphis In 2010 University Place in Memphis became the second only US Green Building Council USGBC LEED certified neighborhood LEED ND neighborhood development standards integrates principles of smart growth urbanism and green building and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC Congress for the New Urbanism and the Natural Resources Defense Council University Place developed by McCormack Baron Salazar is a 405unit 30acre mixedincome mixed use multigenerational HOPE VI grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site The Cotton District The Cotton District in Starkville Mississippi was the first New Urbanist development begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized The District borders Mississippi State University and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants bars and retail The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill Seaside Seaside Florida the first fully New Urbanist town began development in 1981 on eighty acres 324000 m² of Florida Panhandle coastline It was featured on the cover of the Atlantic Monthly in 1988 when only a few streets were completed and has become internationally famous for its architecture and the quality of its streets and public spaces Seaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie The Truman Show Lots sold for 15000 in the early 1980s and slightly over a decade later the price had escalated to about 200000 Today most lots sell for more than a million dollars and some houses top 5 million Mueller Community The Mueller Community is located on the 700 acre site of the former Robert Mueller Municipal Airport in Austin Texas which closed in 1999 Per the developer the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be 13 billion and will comprise 42 million square feet of nonresidential development 650000 square feet of retail space 4600 homes and 140 acres of open space An estimated 10000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program Stapleton The site of the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver and Aurora Colorado closed in 1995 is now being redeveloped by Forest City Enterprises Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30000 residents six schools and 2 million square feet 180000 m² of retail Construction began in 2001 Northfield Stapleton one of the developments major retail centers recently opened San Antonio In 1997 San Antonio Texas as part of a new master plan created new regulations called the Unified Development Code UDC largely influenced by New Urbanism One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts Conservation Development Commercial Center Development Office or Institutional Campus Development Commercial Retrofit Development Tradition Neighborhood Development Transit Oriented Development Each district has specific standards and design regulation The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns Mountain House Mountain House one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States is a new town located near Tracy California Construction started in 2001 Mountain House will consist of 12 villages each with its own elementary school park and commercial area In addition a future train station transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House Mesa del Sol Mesa del Sol New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect Peter Calthorpe and is being developed by Forest City Enterprises Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full buildout at which time it should have 38000 residential units housing a population of 100000 a 1400acre 57 km industrial office park four town centers an urban center and a downtown that would provide a twin city within Albuquerque IOn Located in Mount Pleasant South Carolina IOn is a traditional neighborhood development mixed with a new urbanism styled architecture reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of Charleston South Carolina

also two public elementary schools and an 18hole golf course Celebration Florida In June 1996 the Walt Disney Company unveiled its 5000 acre 20 km² town of Celebration near Orlando Florida Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996 relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside whose downtown was nearly complete Disney shuns the label New Urbanism calling Celebration simply a town Celebrations Downtown has become one of the areas most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a sense of place Jersey City The construction of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County New Jersey has spurred transitoriented development In Jersey City two projects are planned to transform brownfield sites both of which have required remediation of toxic waste by previous owners Bayfront once site of a Honeywell plant is a 100 acres 040 km site on the Hackensack River and is nearby the planned West Campus of New

Chesterfield Township New Jersey The sparsely developed agricultural Township of Chesterfield in New Jersey covers approximately 2161 square miles 560 km and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than 7000 acres 28 km of farmland through state and county programs and a townshipwide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated receiving area known as Old York Village Old York Village is a neotraditional new urbanism town on 560 acres 23 km incorporating a variety of housing types neighborhood commercial facilities a new elementary school civic uses and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village Construction began in the early 2000s

practices in the Civita design In 2009 Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the US Green Building Council’s 2009 LEEDND Neighborhood Development pilot and received the California Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award In 2010 Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental economic and community health Del Mar Station Del Mar Los Angeles Metro station which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003 is a transitoriented development surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena Located at the southern edge of downtown

private courtyards The 34acre 77 million project sits above a 1200car multilevel subterranean parking garage with 600 spaces dedicated to transit The light rail right of way detailed as a public street bisects the site It was designed by Moule Polyzoides Norfolk VA East Beach Norfolk VA East Beach designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany PlaterZyberk Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay Other countries New Urbanism is closely related to the Urban village movement in Europe They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning In Europe many brownfield sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models One wellpublicized example is Poundbury in England a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester which was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall under the overview of Prince Charles The original masterplan was designed by Leon Krier A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents although the aspirations to reduce car dependency had not been successful Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people The Council for European Urbanism CEU formed in 2003 shares many of the same aims as the USs New Urbanists CEUs Charter is a development of the Congress for the New Urbanism Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions An Australian organisation Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country A New Zealand Urban Design Protocol was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005 There are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent Europe Le PlessisRobinson a 21stcentury example of neotraditionalism in the southwest of Paris This city is in the process of transforming itself destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val dEurope In 2008 the city was nominated best
