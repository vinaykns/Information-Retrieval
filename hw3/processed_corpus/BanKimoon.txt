biggest handicaps was his lack of fluency in English which made it difficult for him to win over audiences in the US and elsewhere There have also been questions however regarding the extent of his knowledge of French one of the two working languages of the United Nations Secretariat Career Diplomatic career After graduating from university Ban received the top score on Koreas foreign service exam He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1970 and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the Yusin Constitution Bans first overseas posting was to New Delhi India where

political environment Ban was appointed Ambassador to Austria and Slovenia in 1998 and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan Treaty Organization CTBTO PrepCom During the negotiations in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career he included in a public letter a positive statement about the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty in 2001 not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty To avoid anger from the United States Ban was fired by President Kim Daejung who also issued a public apology for Bans statement Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy In 2001 during the 56th Session of the United Nations General Assembly South Korea held the rotating presidency and to Bans surprise he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president Han Seungsoo In 2003 incoming president Roh Moohyun selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors Foreign minister of South Korea In 2004 Ban replaced Yoon Youngkwan as foreign minister of South Korea under president Roh Moohyun At the

2004 dozens of Koreans died in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea Ban became actively involved in issues relating to NorthSouth Korean relationships In September 2005 as foreign minister he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the Sixparty talks held in Beijing As foreign minister Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for SecretaryGeneral For example Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the Republic of the Congo since its independence in 1960 United Nations career Campaign for SecretaryGeneral 2007 See also United Nations SecretaryGeneral selection 2006 In February 2006 Ban declared his candidacy to replace Kofi Annan as UN SecretaryGeneral at the end of 2006 becoming the first South Korean to run for the office Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy he was not originally considered a serious contender Over the next eight months Ban made ministerial visits to each of the 15 countries with a seat on the Security Council Of the seven candidates he topped each of the four straw polls conducted by the United Nations Security Council on 24 July 14 September 28 September and 2 October During the period in which these polls took place Ban made major speeches to the Asia Society and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City To be confirmed Ban needed not only to win the support of the diplomatic community but also to be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council Peoples Republic of China France Russia the United Kingdom and the United States Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq and had the support of the Bush administration as he pursued the position But Ban also opposed several US positions he expressed his support for the International Criminal Court and favoured an entirely nonconfrontational approach to dealing with North Korea Ban said during his campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with Kim Jongil directly Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan who was considered charismatic but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UNs oilforfood program in Iraq Ban struggled to win the approval of France His official biography states that he speaks both English and French the two working languages of the UN Secretariat However he has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study At a press conference on 11 January 2007 Ban remarked My French perhaps could be improved and I am continuing to work I have taken French lessons over the last few months I think that even if my French isnt perfect I will continue to study it As the SecretaryGeneral election drew closer there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Bans behalf Specifically his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging aid to developing countries were the focus of many news articles According to The Washington Post rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea which has the worlds 11thlargest economy has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were groundless In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated As frontrunner I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process and that he was a man of integrity In the final informal poll on 2 October Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention no opinion from the fifteen members of the Security Council The one abstention came from the Japanese delegation who vehemently opposed the idea of a Korean taking the role of SecretaryGeneral Due to the overwhelming support of Ban by the rest of the Security Council Japan later voted in favor of Ban to avoid controversy More importantly Ban was the only one to escape a veto each of the other candidates received at least one no vote from among the five permanent members After the vote Shashi Tharoor who finished second withdrew his candidacy and Chinas Permanent Representative to the UN told reporters that it is quite clear from todays straw poll that Minister Ban Kimoon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly On 9 October the Security Council formally chose Ban as its nominee In the public vote he was supported by all 15 members of the council On 13 October the 192member General Assembly acclaimed Ban as SecretaryGeneral First term as SecretaryGeneral When Ban became SecretaryGeneral The Economist listed the major challenges facing him in 2007 rising nuclear demons in Iran and North Korea a haemorrhaging wound in Darfur unending violence in the Middle East looming environmental disaster escalating international terrorism the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the spread of HIVAIDS And then the more parochial concerns such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UNs history Before starting Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first SecretaryGeneral Trygve Lie left office he told his successor Dag Hammarskjöld You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth On 23 January 2007 Ban took office as the eighth SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations Bans term as SecretaryGeneral opened with a flap At his first encounter with the press as SecretaryGeneral on 2 January 2007 he refused to condemn the death penalty imposed on Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi High Tribunal remarking The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide Bans statements contradicted longstanding United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a humanrights concern He quickly clarified his stance in the case of Barzan alTikriti and Awad alBandar two top officials who were convicted of the deaths of 148 Shia Muslims in the Iraqi village of Dujail in the 1980s In a statement through his spokesperson on 6 January he strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future On the broader issue he told a Washington DC audience on 16 January 2007 that he recognized and encouraged the growing trend in international society international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty On the tenth anniversary of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pots death 15 April 2008 Ban Kimoon appealed for the senior leaders of the regime to be brought to justice The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodiatribunal which was established by both the United Nations and Cambodia and which became operational in 2006 is expected to continue until at least 2010 Ban has received strong criticism from the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services OIOS which stated that the secretariat under Bans leadership was drifting into irrelevance Cabinet In early January Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet As his Deputy SecretaryGeneral he selected Tanzanian foreign minister and professor AshaRose Migiro a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office The top position devoted exclusively to management UnderSecretaryGeneral for Management was filled by Alicia Bárcena Ibarra of Mexico Bárcena was considered a UN insider having previously served as Annans chief of staff Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy Ban appointed Sir John Holmes the British Ambassador to France as UnderSecretaryGeneral for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved yet later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism In February he continued with appointments selecting B Lynn Pascoe the US ambassador to Indonesia to become UnderSecretaryGeneral for political affairs JeanMarie Guéhenno a French diplomat who had served as UnderSecretaryGeneral for peacekeeping operations under Annan remained in office Ban selected Vijay K Nambiar as his chief of staff The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations During Bans first year as SecretaryGeneral more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before Though not appointed by Ban the president of the General Assembly Haya Rashed AlKhalifa is only the third woman to hold this position in United Nations history Reform agenda During his first month in office Ban proposed two major reforms to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department His proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly who bristled under Bans request for rapid approval The proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world partially because of rumours that Ban hoped to place American B Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office Alejandro D Wolff then acting American ambassador said the United States backed his proposals After the early bout of reproach Ban began extensive consultation with UN ambassadors agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted After the consultations Ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and disarmament Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN requiring that all positions be considered fiveyear appointments all receive strict annual performance reviews and all financial disclosures be made public Though unpopular in the New York office the move was popular in other UN offices around the world and lauded by UN observers Bans proposal to split the peacekeeping operation into one group handling operations and another handling arms was finally adopted in midMarch 2007 Key issues The SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue Although unsuccessful in some areas Bans predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the Millennium Development Goals UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intended to focus in addition to his declared interest in reforming the United Nations bureaucracy On several prominent issues such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea Ban has deferred to the Security Council In 2007 the Republic of Nauru raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China Taiwan to sign the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women Ban referenced the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and refused the motion On 19 July 2007 Taiwanese President Chen Shuibian wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan Ban rejected the request stating that Resolution 2758 defined Taiwan as part of China Global warming Ban early on identified global warming as one of the key issues of his administration In a White House meeting with US President George W Bush in January Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions On 1 March 2007 in a speech before the UN General Assembly Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming Ban stated For my generation coming of age at the height of the Cold War fear of nuclear winter seemed the leading existential threat on the horizon But the danger posed by war to all humanity—and to our planet—is at least matched by climate change referring to Global Warming see PGW portal On 3 September 2009 he further emphasized his concerns at the World Climate Conference in Geneva when he stated Our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss In September 2014 Ban joined demonstrators in the Peoples Climate March in New York City and also called together world leaders for the UN Climate Summit in preparation for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in late 2015 Middle East On Thursday 22 March 2007 while Ban was taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East a mortar attack hit just 80 meters 260 ft from where the SecretaryGeneral was standing interrupting a press conference in Baghdads Green Zone and visibly shaking Ban and others No one was hurt in the incident The United Nations had already limited its role in Iraq after its Baghdad headquarters was bombed in August 2003 killing 22 people Ban said however that he still hoped to find a way for the United Nations to do more for Iraqi social and political development On his trip Ban visited Egypt Israel the West Bank Jordan Lebanon and Saudi Arabia where Ban attended a conference with leaders of the Arab League and met for several hours with Omar Hassan alBashir the Sudanese president who had resisted UN peacekeepers in Darfur While Ban met with Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian president he declined to meet with Ismail Haniya of Hamas Ban Kimoon criticized Israel on 10 March 2008 for planning to build housing units in a West Bank settlement saying the decision conflicts with Israels obligation under the road map for Middle East peace During a meeting of the UN Security Council on Wednesday 7 January 2009 Ban called for an immediate end to fighting in the Gaza Strip He criticized both sides Israel for bombarding Gaza and Hamas for firing rockets into Israel Although the 2009 Iranian presidential election was widely disputed Ban Kimoon sent a traditional congratulation message to the Iranian president upon his inauguration He kept silent over the request of Shirin Ebadi to visit Iran after the crackdown on peaceful postelection protests by the Iranian police which was perceived as a crime against humanity More than 4000 people were arrested and nearly 70 were killed some while being held in prison In another incident several prominent intellectuals including Akbar Ganji Hamid Dabashi and Noam Chomsky went on a threeday hunger strike in front of the UN The incident was followed by an official request by more than 200 intellectuals human rights activists and reformist politicians in Iran for the UN reaction Ban Kimoon however did not take any action to stop the violence in Iran The Libyan Civil War began in 2011 the last year of Bans first term and dominated his attention and public statements that year Throughout the conflict he lobbied for peaceful solutions to the crisis He frequently spoke out against military action in Libya believing that a diplomatic solution would be possible and preferable However he conceded that if thenleader Muammar Gaddafi refused to abide by a cease fire agreement the international coalition of military forces would have no choice but to intervene to protect the human rights of Libyans The Gaddafi government was eventually overthrown and Gaddafi killed in the conflict Darfur Ban took the first foreign trip of his term to attend the African Union summit in Addis Ababa Ethiopia in January 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the

to do so The first phase of the peacekeeping mission began in October 2007 Myanmar Ban Kimoon flew to Myanmar on 25 May 2008 to guide a conference with international agencies aimed at boosting

resolutions reports and conferences criticizing Israel On 26 January 2016 Ban made a statement in relation to the attacks by Palestinians against Israelis Ban Kimoon said that as oppressed peoples

Netanyahu stated that there is no justification for terror Ban has criticized Saudi Arabianled intervention in Yemen saying Grave violations against children increased dramatically as a result of the escalating conflict In June 2016 Ban Kimoon removed a Saudiled coalition from a list of childrens rights violators He later admitted that Saudi Arabia threatened to cut Palestinian aid and funds to

Ban said Russia has a critical role to play in addressing global issues from ending the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria to safeguarding human rights and controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction His comments were condemned by Ukraines UN envoy Volodymyr Yelchenko saying that he doesnt understand how the UN chief can say such things which sort of praise the role of Russia in

scheduled to include 5000 participants including representatives from governments NGOs civil society organizations and the private sector as well as individuals affected by humanitarian crises Criticism as UN SecretaryGeneral According to The Washington Post some UN employees and delegates expressed resentment at Bans perceived favoritism in the appointment of South Korean nationals in key posts Previous UN chiefs such as Kurt Waldheim Austria Javier Pérez de Cuéllar Peru and Boutros BoutrosGhali Egypt brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their countrys Foreign Ministry But according to some officials in the Post story Ban has gone further boosting South Koreas presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office In response Ban and his aides have claimed that allegations of favoritism are wrong and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of racism He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed—including Choi Youngjin who has served as a highranking official in the United Nations peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions Others such as Donald P Gregg a former US ambassador to South Korea say the complaints are driven by envy I think being from South Korea and people have growing respect for South Korea thats a great enhancement for the secretary general If he brings along talented people who whom he knows very well I think thats also a plus UN records show that South Korea the organizations eleventhlargest financial contributor had 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top UN post Former UN Under Secretary General for Oversight Services IngaBritt Ahlenius denounced Ban Kimoon after resigning her post in 2010 calling him reprehensible Ahleniuss critique was based on the grounds that the SecretaryGeneral consistently made efforts to undermine the Office of Internal Oversight Services OIOS mandate and challenge its operational independence In particular the two disputed Ahleniuss plans to hire a former prosecutor Robert Appleton who had carried out aggressive investigations into corruption in UN peacekeeping missions from 2006 to 2009 Bans staff explained that Appletons appointment was rejected because female candidates had not been properly considered and said that the final selection should have been made by Ban not Ahlenius However Ahlenius countered in her End of Assignment memo that for the SecretaryGeneral to control appointments in OIOS is an infringement of the operational independence of OIOS and further stated There is no transparency there is lack of accountability Rather than supporting the internal oversight which is the sign of strong leadership and good governance you have strived to undermine its position and to control it I do not see any signs of reform in the Organization During the ROKS Cheonan sinking events he took the step of demanding action against North Korea for the alleged sinking of a vessel from his country This was reported by UN Dispatch as being unusual because it is rare for any SecretaryGeneral—and particularly Ban Kimoon—to comment on the Security Council taking action on an issue as his office had tended to be extremely deferential to the Security Council Former UN corruption fighter James Wasserstrom has also been critical of Ban Kimoon for attempting to limit the jurisdiction of the UN dispute tribunal following his dismissal from his Kosovo post and lengthy appeals process Ban had refused to hand over confidential documents relating to the case to the UN personnel tribunal despite repeated orders by the court to do so In relation to another case Ban was admonished by Judge Michael Adams for wilful disobedience for again failing to hand over key documents in an internal promotions dispute In 2013 Ban was accused of undermining collective bargaining rights of The Staff Coordinating Council the union representing United Nations staff Ban unilaterally eliminated the role of the union to negotiate on behalf of the employees and terminated talks when the union protested The United Nations champions the right to collective bargaining as a basic human right in its own charter enacted as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention 1949 Article 1 International human rights organizations are critical of Ban Kimoon for lacking accountability over negligent actions by the United Nations Scientists and journalists conclusively proved that UN peacekeepers from Nepal were the source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak which has killed approximately 9000 people and infected more than 1 in 20 Haitians Ban has declared that the legal immunity of the United Nations before national courts should be upheld though this does not reduce the UNs moral responsibility to overcoming Haitis cholera epidemic Ban is named in a lawsuit challenging UN immunity on behalf of Haitian cholera victims in the US District Court of Manhattan In January 2015 Judge J Paul Oetken dismissed the case affirming UN immunity An appeal to Oetkens decision was submitted to the Court in May 2015 Much press coverage of Ban has been critical with The Economist in May 2016 calling him plodding protocolconscious and loth to stand up to the big powers and the dullest—and among the worst secretarygenerals An article in The Guardian of July 2010 calls his performance deplorable although Ban is defended by some Asian commentators who see his understated presence as more quietly Confucian An article in Foreign Policy noted in a profile of Ban that while he would greet world leaders in their native language he would then read directly from his talking points without small talk The UN official who reported this style stated Quiet diplomacy He Ban displayed no skills for that” 2017 presidential candidacy speculation Main article South Korean presidential election 2017 Until the outbreak of the 2016 South Korean political scandal Ban was the leading potential candidate for President of South Korea in 2017 However recent polls show Moon Jaein of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea in the lead with a support rating of 328 percent while Ban trails in distant second with 154 percent Although Ban has repeatedly expressed his desires for running a UN resolution in 1946 says a SecretaryGeneral should refrain from accepting any Governmental position at any rate immediately on retirement Exceptions to the rule have been made in past history with the 1986 election of Kurt Waldheim to the post of President of Austria although the position is ceremonial in nature Contrary to Bans public comments hinting at any likely run private reports indicate otherwise Kim Jongpil former Prime Minister of South Korea was reported to say that Ban Kimoon would announce his candidacy for the presidency shortly after his term as SecretaryGeneral ends Ban was originally predicted to run under the conservative Saenuri Party but President Park Geynhyes scandal has cast doubts as to which party Ban would run under Ban returned to South Korea on January 13 2017 On February 1 2017 he announced he would not be a candidate for president Personal life Family Ban Kimoon met Yoo Soontaek in 1962 when they were both in high school Ban was 18 years old and Yoo Soontaek

hometown where his extended family still resides Over 50000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result In the months following his election thousands of practitioners of geomancy went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group and has declined to expound his beliefs Now as SecretaryGeneral it will not be appropriate at this time to talk about my own belief in any particular religion or god So maybe we will have some other time to talk about personal matters His mother is Buddhist On 10 January 2017 Bans brother Ban Kisang and nephew Bahn Joohyun have been indicted on US charges that they engaged in a scheme to bribe a Middle Eastern official in connection with the attempted 800 million sale of a building complex in Vietnam Personality During his tenure at the South Korean Foreign Ministry Bans nickname was jusa 주사 meaning the administrative clerk The name was
