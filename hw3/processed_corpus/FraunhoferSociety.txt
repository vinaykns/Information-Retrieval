 The Fraunhofer Society German FraunhoferGesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e V — Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research pronounced ˈfraʊnhoːfɐ is a German research organization with 67 institutes spread throughout Germany each focusing on different fields of applied science as opposed to the Max Planck Society which works primarily on basic science It employs around 24000 people mainly scientists and engineers with an annual research budget of about €21 billion Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state the German public through the federal government together with the states or Länder owns the Fraunhofer Society but more than 70 of the funding is earned through contract work either for governmentsponsored projects or from industry It is named after Joseph von Fraunhofer who as a scientist an engineer and an entrepreneur is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the society The organization has seven centers in the United States under the name Fraunhofer USA and three in Asia In October 2010 Fraunhofer announced that it would open its first research center in South America Fraunhofer UK Research Ltd was established along with the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics in Glasgow Scotland in March 2012 The Fraunhofer Model The socalled Fraunhofer Model has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the societys continuing growth Under the model the Fraunhofer Society earns about 70 of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects The other 30 of the budget is sourced in the proportion 91 from federal and state Land government grants and is used to support preparatory research Thus the size of the societys budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions This funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes This serves both to drive the realisation of the Fraunhofer Societys strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research as well as encouraging a flexible autonomous and entrepreneurial approach to the societys research priorities Institutes The Fraunhofer

CMI Sustainable Energy Systems – CSE Digital Media Technologies – DMT Notable projects The MP3 compression algorithm was invented and patented by Fraunhofer IIS Its license revenues generated about €100 million in revenue for the society in 2005 The Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute HHI was a significant contributor to the H264MPEG4 AVC video compression standard a technology recognized with two Emmy awards in 2008 and 2009 This includes the Fraunhofer FDK AAC library As of May 2010 a metamorphic triplejunction solar cell developed by Fraunhofers Institute for Solar Energy Systems holds the world record for solar energy conversion efficiency with 411 nearly twice that of a standard siliconbased cell Fraunhofer is developing a program for use at IKEA stores which would allow people to take a picture of their home into a store to view a fully assembled digital adaptation of their room Epuzzler a patternrecognition machine which can digitally put back together even the most finely shredded papers The Epuzzler uses a computerized conveyor belt that runs shards of shredded and torn paper through a digital scanner automatically reconstructing original documents OpenIMS an Open Source implementation of IMS Call Session Control Functions CSCFs and a lightweight Home Subscriber Server HSS which together form the core elements of all IMSNGN architectures as specified today within 3GPP 3GPP2 ETSI TISPAN and the PacketCable initiative History The Fraunhofer Society was founded in Munich on March 26 1949 by representatives of industry and academia the government of Bavaria and the nascent Federal Republic In 1952 the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs declared the Fraunhofer Society to be the third part of the nonuniversity German research landscape alongside the German research councils DFG and the Max Planck Institutes Whether the Fraunhofer Society should support applied research through its own facilities was however the subject of a longrunning dispute From 1954 the Societys first institutes developed By 1956 it was developing research facilities in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense In 1959 the Fraunhofer Society comprised nine institutes with 135 coworkers and a budget of 36 million Deutsche Mark In 1965 the Fraunhofer Society was identified as a sponsor organization for applied research In 1968 the Fraunhofer Society became the target of public criticism for its role in military research By 1969 Fraunhofer had more than 1200 employees in 19 institutes The budget stood at 33 million Deutsche Mark At this time a commission for the promotion of the development of the Fraunhofer Society planned the further development of the Fraunhofer Society FhG The commission developed a financing model that would make the Society dependent on its commercial success This would later come to be known as the Fraunhofer Model The Model was agreed to by the Federal Cabinet and the BundLänderKommission in 1973 In the same year the executive committee and central administration moved into joint accommodation at Leonrodstraße 54 in Munich The Fraunhofer program for the promotion of the consulting research for SMEs was established and has gained ever more significance in subsequent years In 1977 the political ownership of the society was shared by the Ministries of Defense and Research By 1984 the Fraunhofer Society had 3500 employees in 33 institutes and a research budget of 360 million Deutsche Mark By 1988 defense research represented only about 10 of the entire expenditure of the Fraunhofer Society By 1989 the Fraunhofer Society had nearly 6400 employees in 37 institutes with a total budget of 700 million Deutsche Mark In 1991 the Fraunhofer Society faced the challenge of integrating numerous research establishments in former East Germany as branch offices of alreadyexisting institutes in the Fraunhofer Society In 1993 the Fraunhofer Societys total budget exceeded 1 billion Deutsche Mark In 1994 the Society founded a USbased subsidiary Fraunhofer USA Inc to extend the outreach of Fraunhofers RD network to American clients Its mission statement of 2000 committed the Fraunhofer Society to being a market and customeroriented nationally and internationally active sponsor organization for institutes of the applied research Between 2000 and 2001 the institutes and IT research centers of the GMD Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung – Society for Mathematics and Information technology were integrated into the Fraunhofer Society at the initiative of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research The year 2000 marked a noteworthy success at FraunhoferInstitut for Integrated Circuits IIS MP3 a lossy audio format which they developed is the most widely adopted method for compressing and decompressing digital audio In 2002 ownership of the HeinrichHertzInstitut for Communications Technology Berlin GmbH HHI which belonged to the Gottfried William Leibniz Society e V GWL was transferred to the Fraunhofer Society With this integration the Fraunhofer Society budget exceeded €1 billion for the first time In 2003 the Fraunhofer Society headquarters moved to its own building in Munich The Fraunhofer Society developed and formulated a firm specific mission statement summarizing fundamental targets and codifying the desired values and guidelines of the societys culture Amongst these the society committed itself to improving the opportunities for female employees and coworkers to identify themselves with the enterprise and to develop their own creative potential In 2004 the former Fraunhofer Working Group for Electronic Media Technology at the FraunhoferInstitut for Integrated Circuits IIS gained the status of an independent institute It becomes FraunhoferInstitut for Digital Media Technology IDMT New alliances and topic groups helped to strengthen the market operational readiness level of the institutes for Fraunhofer in certain jurisdictions In 2005 two new institutes the Leipzig FraunhoferInstitut for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI and the Fraunhofer Center for Nanoelectronic technologies CNT in Dresden were founded In 2006 the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems IAIS was founded as a merger between the Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems AIS and the Institute for Media Communication IMK Presidents Walther Gerlach 1949–1951 Wilhelm Roelen 1951–1955 Hermann von Siemens 1955–1964 Franz Kollmann 1964–1968 Christian Otto Mohr 1968–1974 Heinz Keller 1974–1982 Max Syrbe
