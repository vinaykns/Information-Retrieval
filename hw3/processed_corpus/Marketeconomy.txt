 A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment production and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand which determines the prices of goods and services The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions or the allocation of producer good are primarily made through capital and financial markets This is contrasted with a planned economy where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production Market economies can range from free market systems to regulated markets and various forms of interventionist variants In reality free markets do not exist in pure form since societies and governments all regulate them to varying degrees Different perspectives exist as to how strong a role the government should have in both guiding and regulating market economies and addressing the inequalities the market naturally produces Most existing market economies include a degree of statedirected activity or economic planning and are thus classified as mixed economies The term freemarket economy is sometimes used synonymously with market economy Market economies do not logically presuppose the existence of private ownership of the means of production A market economy can and often does include various types of cooperatives collectives or autonomous state agencies that acquire and exchange capital goods in capital markets These all utilize a marketdetermined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor In addition there are many variations of market socialism some of which involve employeeowned enterprises based on selfmanagement as well as models that involve the combination of public ownership of the means of production with factor markets Capitalism Main article Capitalism Capitalism generally refers to an economic system where the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for a profit structured on the process of capital accumulation In general in capitalist systems investment distribution income and prices are determined by markets whether regulated or unregulated There are different variations of capitalism with different relationships to markets In Laissezfaire and free market variations of capitalism markets are utilized most extensively with minimal or no state intervention and regulation over prices and the supply of goods and services In interventionist welfare capitalism and mixed economies markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct market failures or to promote social welfare In state capitalist systems markets are relied upon the least with the state relying heavily on either indirect economic planning andor stateowned enterprises to accumulate capital Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism but most feel that the term mixed economies more precisely describes most contemporary economies due to their containing both privateowned and stateowned enterprises In capitalism prices determine the demandsupply scale For example higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices Laissezfaire Main articles Laissezfaire and Economic liberalism Laissezfaire is synonymous with what was referred to as strict capitalist free market economy during the early and mid19th century as a classical liberal rightlibertarian ideal to achieve It is generally understood that the necessary components for the functioning of an idealized free market include the complete absence of government regulation subsidies artificial price pressures and governmentgranted monopolies usually classified as coercive monopoly by free market advocates and no taxes or tariffs other than what is necessary for the government to provide protection from coercion and theft maintaining peace and property rights and providing for basic public goods Rightlibertarian advocates of anarchocapitalism see the state as morally illegitimate and economically unnecessary and destructive Freemarket economy See also Free market Freemarket economy refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy It typically entails support for highly competitive markets private ownership of productive enterprises Laissezfaire is a more extensive form of freemarket economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting property rights Welfare capitalism Main article Welfare capitalism Welfare capitalism refers to a capitalist economy that includes public policies favoring extensive provisions for social welfare services The economic mechanism involves a free market and the predominance of privately owned enterprises in the economy but public provision of universal welfare services aimed at enhancing individual autonomy and maximizing equality Examples of contemporary welfare capitalism include the Nordic model of capitalism predominant in Northern Europe Regional models AngloSaxon model Main article AngloSaxon economy AngloSaxon capitalism refers to the form of capitalism predominant in Anglophone countries and typified by the economy of the United States It is contrasted with European models of capitalism such as the continental Social market model and the Nordic model AngloSaxon capitalism refers to a macroeconomic policy regime and capital market structure common to the Anglophone economies Among these characteristics are low rates of taxation more open financial markets lower labor market protections and a less generous welfare state eschewing collective bargaining schemes found in the continental and northern European models of capitalism East Asian model Main article East Asian model of capitalism The East Asian model of capitalism involves a strong role for state investment and in some instances involves stateowned enterprises The state takes an active role in promoting economic development through subsidies the facilitation of national champions and an exportbased model of growth The actual practice of this model varies by country This designation has been applied to the economies of Singapore Japan Taiwan South Korea and the Peoples Republic of China A related concept in political science is the developmental state Social market economy Main article Social market economy This model was implemented by Alfred MüllerArmack and Ludwig Erhard after World War II in West Germany The social market economic model sometimes called Rhine capitalism is based upon the idea of realizing the benefits of a free market economy especially economic performance and high supply of goods while avoiding disadvantages such as market failure destructive competition concentration of economic power and the antisocial effects of market processes The aim of the social market economy is to realize greatest prosperity combined with best possible social security One difference from the free market economy is that the state is not passive but takes active regulatory measures The social policy objectives include employment housing and education policies as well as a sociopolitically motivated balancing of the distribution of income growth Characteristics of social market economies are a strong competition policy and a contractionary monetary policy The philosophical background is Neoliberalism or Ordoliberalism Market socialism Main article Market socialism Market socialism refers to various types of economic systems where the means of production and the dominant economic institutions are either publicly owned or cooperatively owned but operated according to the rules of supply and demand This type of market economy has its roots in classical economics and in the works of Adam Smith the Ricardian socialists and Mutualist philosophers The distinguishing feature between nonmarket socialism and market socialism is the existence of a market for factors of production and the criteria of profitability for enterprises Profits derived from publicly owned enterprises can variously be used to reinvest in further production to directly finance government and social services or be distributed to the public at large through a social dividend or basic income system Public ownership models In the 1930s the economists Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner developed a model of socialism that posited that a public body dubbed the Central Planning Board could set prices through a trialanderror approach until they equaled the marginal cost of production in order to achieve perfect competition and pareto optimality In this model of socialism firms would be stateowned and managed by their employees and the profits would be disbursed among the population in a social dividend This model came to be referred to as market socialism because it involved the use of money a price system and simulated capital markets all of which were absent from traditional of nonmarket socialism A more contemporary model of market socialism is that put forth by the American economist John Roemer referred to as Economic democracy In this model social ownership is achieved through public ownership of equity in a market economy A Bureau of Public Ownership BPO would own controlling shares in publicly listed firms so that the profits generated would be used for public finance and the provision of a basic income Cooperative socialism Libertarian socialists and leftanarchists often promote a form of market socialism in which enterprises are owned and managed cooperatively by their workforce so that the profits directly remunerate the employeeowners These cooperative enterprises would compete with each other in the same way private companies compete with each other in a capitalist market The first major elaboration of this type of market socialism was made by Pierre Joseph Proudhon and was called mutualism Selfmanaged market socialism was promoted in Yugoslavia by economists Branko Horvat and Jaroslav Vanek In the selfmanaged model of socialism firms would be directly owned by their employees and the management board would be elected by employees These cooperative firms would compete with each other in a market for both capital goods and for selling consumer goods Socialist market economy Following the 1978 reforms the Peoples Republic of China developed what it calls a socialist market economy in which most of the economy is under state ownership with the state enterprises organized as jointstock companies with various government agencies owning controlling shares through a shareholder system Prices are set by a largely freeprice system and the stateowned enterprises are not subjected to micromanagement by a government planning agency A similar system called socialistoriented market economy has emerged in Vietnam following the Đổi Mới reforms in 1986 This system is frequently characterized as state capitalism instead of market socialism because there is no meaningful degree of employee selfmanagement in firms because the state enterprises retain their profits instead of distributing them to the workforce or government and because many function as de facto private enterprises The profits neither finance a social dividend to benefit the population at large nor do they accrue to their employees In the Peoples Republic of China this economic model is presented as a preliminary stage of socialism to explain the dominance of capitalistic management practices and forms of enterprise organization in both the state and nonstate sectors Criticisms The economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that markets suffer from informational inefficiency and the presumed efficiency of markets stems from the faulty assumptions of neoclassical welfare economics particularly the assumption of perfect and costless information and related incentive problems Neoclassical economics assumes static equilibrium and efficient markets require that there be no nonconvexities even though nonconvexities are pervasive in modern economies Stiglitzs critique applies to both existing models of capitalism and to hypothetical models of market socialism However Stiglitz does not advocate replacing markets but states that there is a significant role for government intervention to boost the efficiency of markets and to address the pervasive market failures that exist in contemporary economies A fair Market Economy is in fact a Martingale or a Brownian motion model and for a participant competitor in such a model there is no more than 50 of success chances Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert claim that markets inherently produce class division Albert states that even if everyone started out with a balanced job complex doing a mix of roles of varying creativity responsibility and empowerment in a market economy class divisions would arise Without taking the argument that far it is evident that in a market system with uneven distribution of empowering work such as Economic Democracy some workers will be more able than others to capture the benefits of economic gain For example if one worker designs cars and another builds them the designer will use his cognitive skills more frequently than the builder In the long term the designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder giving the former greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of income A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten to work for a company that will pay him more The effect is a class division between conceptual and manual laborers and ultimately managers and workers and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers David McNally argues that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges arguing that Adam Smiths moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free markets he championed The development of the market economy involved coercion exploitation and violence that Adam Smiths moral philosophy could not countenance McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as private ownership of the means of production McNally argues that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to wagebased labor See
