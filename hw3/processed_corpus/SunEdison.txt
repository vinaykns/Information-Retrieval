 SunEdison Inc is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the US In addition to developing building owning and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants it also manufactures high purity polysilicon monocrystalline silicon ingots silicon wafers solar modules solar energy systems and solar module racking systems Originally a siliconwafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company a former business unit of Monsanto Company Monsanto sold the company in 1989 Prior to May 30 2013 the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials the name change to SunEdison reflects the companys focus on solar energy SunEdisons corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights Missouri and the companys operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont California with offices throughout the world Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959 MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers the most basic element of semiconductorchip manufacturing The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006 with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solarenergy companies Contracts with other solarenergy companies followed as did jointventure projects on solar power plants With the acquisition of the large successful and pioneering solarenergy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solarpower companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011 MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solarenergy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market The company now develops finances and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial publicsector and powerplant customer base and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison Inc reflects its main focus It is one of the leading solarpower companies worldwide and with its acquisition of windenergy company First Wind in 2014 SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world SunEdisons subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewableenergy projects around the globe In 2015 SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison Incs transition from a semiconductorwafer company to a dedicated renewableenergy corporation Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residentialrooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015 SunEdisons stock plummeted and its more than 11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21 2016 History Foundation The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company MEMC a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry was announced on August 6 1959 as an arm of the USbased multinational corporation Monsanto In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St Peters Missouri 30 miles west of Monsantos headquarters in St Louis As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers MEMC was a pioneer in the field and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century MEMC used the Czochralski process CZ process of silicon crystal production and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing CMP process of wafer finishing In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers and developed zerodislocation crystal growing which made largediameter silicon crystals possible Expansion In the early 1970s MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and sent its St Peters–produced 225inch ingots there for slicing and polishing In 1979 MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm 5inch wafers in 1981 the first to produce 150mm 6inch wafers and in partnership with IBM in 1984 the first to produce 200mm 8inch wafers In 1986 MEMC opened its production and RD facility in Utsunomiya Japan to serve the Japanese semiconductor market becoming the first nonJapanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan Change of ownership MEMC experienced heavy pricepressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s Despite its success and increasing revenues MEMC had to account for losses for a few years leading to the decision of Monsanto which was refocusing on chemicals agriculture and biotechnology products to sell the electronic materials division In 1989 the German company Hüls AG the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon DNS to form MEMC Electronic Materials DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials Hüls supported the new subsidiary with 50 million for research and development and for manufacturing expansion In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon which provided cost and productivity advantages over chunk polysilicon Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporations granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena Texas which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987 MEMCs stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995 The IPO raised over 400 million which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company and HülsVEBA retained a majority interest in the company The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard In 1998 the company reported a loss of 316 million on revenues of 759 million In June 2000 VEBA AG still holding 72 of MEMC was merged with VIAG to form the new EON AG EON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001 Finally in October 2001 EON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group TPG which purchased EONs stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC 150 million in credit lines TPG restructured MEMCs debt increased its stake in the company to 90 and cut one third of its workforce MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008 MEMCs market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures MEMCs sales topped 1 billion in 2004 and it was number three in market share Through a secondary offering TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34 and by the end of 2007 to zero Solar market entry In 2006 MEMC announced its largescale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market via longterm agreements to supply Chinabased Suntech Power and Taiwanbased Gintech Energy with solargrade silicon wafers Similar contracts followed with Germanybased Conergy in 2007 and Taiwanbased Tainergy Tech in 2008 The company cultivated shortterm solar wafer customers as well By 2007 MEMC held approximately 14 of the solar wafer market Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008 Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009 In July 2009 MEMC and QCells which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria Germany with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and QCells converting them into solar cells Both partners invested 100 million each in return for a 50each ownership of the project As planned the plant was sold to an investment firm Nordcapital after operations started at the beginning of 2010 Acquisition of SunEdison In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC North Americas largest solar energy services provider Founded by Jigar Shah SunEdison had been developing financing building operating and monitoring largescale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers including many national retail outlets government agencies and utilities since 2003 The company had pioneered solarasaservice and the solar power purchase agreement PPA for nomoneydown customer financing With the acquisition of SunEdison MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North Americas largest solar energy services provider CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products SunEdison was purchased for 200 million 70 in cash and 30 in MEMC stock plus retention payments transaction expenses and the assumption of net debt Following its acquisition of SunEdison MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of lowcost highperformance solar panels It acquired the Californiabased solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010 The acquisition included Solaicxs highvolume proprietary continuous crystal growth manufacturing technology which produces lowcost monocrystalline silicon ingots for highefficiency solar cells In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 5050 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan South Korea The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10000 metric tons per annum As of late 2014 the joint venture called SMP is 85 owned by SunEdison 50 by SunEdison Inc and 35 by SunEdison Semiconductor and 15 by Samsung and the plant has a capacity of 13500 metric tons per annum By October 2014 the plant began producing the world’s first highpressure fluidized bed reactor HPFBR polysilicon enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy In 2011 MEMC also extended its solarenergy business In June 2011 it acquired another North American solarpower project developer Axio Power Axio Power founded in 2007 developed financed and constructed largescale solar projects and had more than 500 MW of utilityscale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western US In July 2011 MEMC established a joint venture with Koreabased Jusung Engineering to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusungs highefficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide lowcost highefficiency solar cells In September 2011 MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc the US unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures a developer operator and owner of solar power plants The FRV purchase added up to 14 GW of solar projects in the US to MEMCs portfolio In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules The company announced a headcount reduction of 1300 employees 18 of the workforce plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multicrystalline 290watt solar modules With 1000volt UL certification the modules created considerable overall energyproduction and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired Name change On May 30 2013 MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison Inc and also changed its stockmarket ticker from WFR to SUNE reflecting the companys focus on solar energy In May 2014 SunEdison formally separated its electronicswafer business from its solarwafer and solarenergy business SunEdison Semiconductor Ltd spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker SEMI with SunEdison Inc maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder The IPO generated 94 million used to fund the companys growth In July 2014 SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary called TerraForm Power Inc with SunEdison Inc maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker TERP This IPO of the powergeneration subsidiary spinoff raised roughly 500 million SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary TerraForm Global in 2015 to manage renewableenergy projects in emerging markets like Brazil China and India This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker GLBL In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of zero white space solar modules which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface That month it also announced the implementation of highpressure fluidized bed reactor HPFBR technology producing highpurity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90 less energy used than nonFBR technologies In November 2014 with its subsidiary TerraForm Power SunEdison purchased First Wind one of the largest wind power developers in the United States for 24 billion The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdisons capacity and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world In 2015 MIT Technology Review named SunEdison 6 and the top energy company in its annual 50 Smartest Companies list The review characterized SunEdison as Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world In June 2015 SunEdison Inc announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor The completion of the selloff finalized SunEdisons transition into a dedicated renewableenergy company Bankruptcy Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residentialrooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015 SunEdisons stock plummeted and its more than 11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016 It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21 2016 To continue its operations and pay staff the company received 300 million in bankruptcy debt financing It will continue operations during bankruptcy The debt financing money came from firstlien and secondlien lenders The bankruptcy court must approve the money When it filed for bankruptcy the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days and that the maximum budget be 1 million Reuters noted that comparatively the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp took one year and cost 40 million During the summer of 2015 SunEdison was worth almost 10 billion and in July 2015 shares traded upward of 3344 On the day of the bankruptcy filing the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share According to the Wall Street Journal “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewablepower projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model” During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing SunEdison invested 18 billion in acquisitions During that time the company also raised 24 billion in debt and equity As of late April 2016 the US Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices Internally SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud SunEdison companies SunEdison Inc TerraForm References Swinger Patricia Building on the Past Ready for the Future A
