Kingdom of Spain Spanish Reino de España is a sovereign state located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe with two large archipelagos the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar to the north and northeast by France Andorra and the Bay of Biscay and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean It is the only European country to have a border with an African country Morocco and its African territory accounts for nearly 5 of its population mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla With an area of 505990 km 195360 sq mi Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union and the fourth largest country in the European continent By population Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union Spains capital and largest city is Madrid other major urban areas include Barcelona Valencia Seville Bilbao and Málaga Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35000 years ago Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician Greek and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE after which the region was named Hispania based on the earlier Phoenician name Span or Spania In the Middle Ages the area was conquered by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the eight centurieslong reconquest or Reconquista from the Moors in 1492 In the early modern period Spain became one of historys first global colonial empires leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Spanish speakers making Spanish the worlds second most spoken first language after Mandarin Chinese Spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy It is a middle power and a major developed country with the worlds fourteenth largest economy by nominal GDP and sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity It is a member of the United Nations UN the European Union EU the Eurozone the Council of Europe CoE the Organization of IberoAmerican States OEI the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD the World Trade Organization WTO and many other international organisations Etymology The origins of the Roman name Hispania from which the modern name España was derived are uncertain due to inadequate evidence although it is documented that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians referred to the region as Spania therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a Semitic – Phoenician one Down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses The Renaissance scholar Antonio de Nebrija proposed that the word Hispania evolved from the Iberian word Hispalis meaning city of the western world Jesús Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the Phoenician word spy meaning to forge metals Therefore ispnya would mean the land where metals are forged It may be a derivation of the Phoenician IShpania meaning island of rabbits land of rabbits or edge a reference to Spains location at the end of the Mediterranean Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet and Strabo called it the land of the rabbits Hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term Hesperia reflecting the Greek perception of Italy as a western land or land of the setting sun Hesperia Ἑσπερία in Greek and Spain being still further west as Hesperia ultima There is the claim that Hispania derives from the Basque word Ezpanna meaning edge or border another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent Two 15thcentury Spanish Jewish scholars Don Isaac Abravanel and Solomon ibn Verga gave an explanation now considered folkloric Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem This man was a Grecian by birth but who had been given a kingdom in Spain He became related by marriage to Espan the nephew of king Heracles who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece leaving his kingdom to his nephew Espan from whom the country of España Spain took its name Based upon their testimonies this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c 350 BCE History Main article History of Spain Iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the Iberians Basques and Celts Early on its coastal areas were settled by Phoenicians who founded Western Europe´s most ancient cities Cadiz and Malaga Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the Carthaginian Empire becoming a major theater of the Punic Wars against the expanding Roman Empire After an arduous conquest the peninsula came fully under Roman Rule During the early Middle Ages it came under Germanic rule but later much of it was conquered by Moorish invaders from North Africa In a process that took centuries the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula The last Moorish kingdom fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe the leading world power for a century and a half and the largest overseas empire for three centuries Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable Prior to the Second World War Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy Spain joined the European Union experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth Prehistory and preRoman peoples Main article Prehistoric Iberia Archaeological research at Atapuerca indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by hominids 12 million years ago In Atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in Europe the Homo antecessor Modern humans first arrived in Iberia from the north on foot about 35000 years ago The best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the Altamira cave of Cantabria in northern Iberia which were created from 35600 to 13500 BCE by CroMagnon Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the Iberians and the Celts The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula from the northeast to the southeast The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula from the northwest to the southwest Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas the Phoenicianinfluenced Tartessians culture flourished in the southwest and the Lusitanians and Vettones occupied areas in the central west A number of cities were founded along the coast by Phoenicians and trading outposts were established by Greeks in the North East Eventually PhoenicianCarthaginians expanded inland conquering about over half of modernday Spain Roman Empire and the Gothic Kingdom Main articles Hispania and Visigothic Kingdom During the Second Punic War an expanding Roman Republic captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast from roughly 210 to 205 BC It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula though they had control of it for over six centuries Roman rule was bound together by law language and the Roman road The cultures of the Celtic and Iberian populations were gradually Romanised Latinised at differing rates in different parts of Hispania Local leaders were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market and its harbours exported gold wool olive oil and wine Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects some of which remain in use Emperors Hadrian Trajan Theodosius I and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century AD and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century AD Most of Spains present languages and religion and the basis of its laws originate from this period The weakening of the Western Roman Empires jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409 when the Germanic Suebi and Vandals together with the Sarmatian Alans crossed the Rhine and ravaged Gaul until the Visigoths drove them into Iberia that same year The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal whereas the Vandals briefly established themselves in southern Spain before crossing over to North Africa and conquering Carthage As the western empire disintegrated the social and economic base became greatly simplified but even in modified form the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture The Byzantines established an enclave Spania in the south with the intention of reviving the Roman empire throughout Iberia Eventually however Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule Isidore of Seville archbishop of Seville was an influential philosopher and was much studied in the Middle Ages in Europe Also his theories were vital to the conversion of the Visigothic Kingdom to a Catholic one in the Councils of Toledo This Gothic kingdom was the first Christian kingdom ruling in the Iberian Peninsula and in the Reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the Muslim rule Middle Ages Muslim era and Reconquista Main articles AlAndalus and Reconquista In the 8th century nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered 711–718 by largely Moorish Muslim armies from North Africa These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate Only a small area in the mountainous northwest of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion Under Islamic law Christians and Jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as People of the Book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims Conversion to Islam proceeded at an increasing pace The muladíes Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of AlAndalus by the end of the 10th century The Muslim community in the Iberian Peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions The Berber people of North Africa who had provided the bulk of the invading armies clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East Over time large Moorish populations became established especially in the Guadalquivir River valley the coastal plain of Valencia the Ebro River valley and towards the end of this period in the mountainous region of Granada Córdoba the capital of the caliphate since AbdarRahman III was the largest richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe Some important philosophers at the time were Averroes Ibn Arabi and Maimonides The Romanised cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways giving the region a distinctive culture Outside the cities where the vast majority lived the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture In the 11th century the Muslim holdings fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings with a stricter less tolerant application of Islam and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes This reunited Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains The Reconquista Reconquest was the centurieslong period in which Christian rule was reestablished over the Iberian Peninsula The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the Battle of Covadonga won by Don Pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula The Christian armys victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains Shortly after in 739 Muslim forces were driven from Galicia which was to eventually host one of medieval Europes holiest sites Santiago de Compostela and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom The Kingdom of León was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries In 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in León Cortes of León The Kingdom of Castile formed from Leonese territory was its successor as strongest kingdom The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown while the nobles benefited from feudalism Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the Battle of Poitiers Frankia Later Frankish forces established Christian counties on the southern side of the Pyrenees These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon For several centuries the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the Ebro and Douro valleys The County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean In 1229 Majorca was conquered so was Valencia in 1238 The breakup of AlAndalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative The capture of the strategically central city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248 After 800 years of Muslim presence in Spain the last Nasrid sultanate of Granada a tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon From the mid 13th century literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms based on Roman and Gothic traditions An important philosopher from this time is Ramon Llull Abraham Cresques was a prominent Jewish cartographer Roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators The king Alfonso X of Castile focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European Christendom He worked for being elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and published the Siete Partidas code The Toledo School of Translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic Ancient Greek and Ancient Hebrew The Islamic transmission of the classics is the main Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe The Castilian language—more commonly known especially later in history and at present as Spanish after becoming the national language and lingua franca of Spain—evolved from Vulgar Latin as did other Romance languages of Spain like the Catalan Asturian and Galician languages as well as other Romance languages in Latin Europe Basque the only nonRomance language in Spain continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval The Glosas Emilianenses founded in the monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla contain the first written words in both Basque and Spanish having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of Latin In the 13th and 14th centuries the Marinid Muslim sect based in North Africa invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to reestablish Muslim rule in Iberia and were soon driven out The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon centred in Spains north east expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean to Sicily and even Athens Around this time the universities of Palencia 12121263 and Salamanca 12181254 were established The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain Imperial Spain Main article Spanish Empire In 1469 the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon 1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands and in 1492 the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the Emirate of Granada ending the last remnant of a 781year presence of Islamic rule in Iberia That same year Spains Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition The Treaty of Granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims and although the tolerance was only partial it was not until the beginning of the 17th century following the Revolt of the Alpujarras that Muslims were finally expelled The year 1492 also marked the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World during a voyage funded by Isabella Columbuss first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas although he remained convinced that he had reached the Orient The colonisation of the Americas started with conquistadores like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the European cultures and people As Renaissance New Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility and the word España whose root is the ancient name Hispania began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms With their wideranging political legal religious and military reforms Spain emerged as the first world power The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country in social political laws currency and language There were two big revolts against the new Habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperialstyle crown Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile and Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Majorca and Valencia After years of combat Comuneros Juan López de Padilla Juan Bravo and Francisco Maldonado were executed and María Pacheco went into exile Germana de Foix also finished with the revolt in the Mediterranean Spain was Europes leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the worlds leading maritime power It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs—Charles I 1516–1556 and Philip II 1556–1598 This period saw the Italian Wars the Revolt of the Comuneros the Dutch Revolt the Morisco Revolt clashes with the Ottomans the AngloSpanish War and wars with France Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance the Spanish Empire expanded to include vast areas in the Americas islands in the AsiaPacific area areas of Italy cities in Northern Africa as well as parts of what are now France Germany Belgium Luxembourg and the Netherlands The first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519–1521 It was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set This was an Age of Discovery with daring explorations by sea and by land the openingup of new trade routes across oceans conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism Spanish explorers brought back precious metals spices luxuries and previously unknown plants and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations The rise of humanism the CounterReformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century Spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides Barbary pirates under the aegis of the rapidly growing Ottoman Empire disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an Islamic invasion This was at a time when Spain was often at war with France The Protestant Reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean By the middle decades of a war and plagueridden 17thcentury Europe the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continentwide religiouspolitical conflicts These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640 and the Netherlands and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive Europewide Thirty Years War In the latter half of the 17th century Spain went into a gradual decline during which it surrendered several small territories to France and the Netherlands however it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century The War of the Spanish Succession was a wideranging international conflict combined with a civil war and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent During this war a new dynasty originating in France the Bourbons was installed Long united only by the Crown a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king Philip V united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdoms elite and monarchy Military assistance for the rebellious British colonies in the American War of Independence improved the kingdoms international standing Liberalism and nation state Main articles Mid19thcentury Spain Spanish American wars of independence Spanish–American War and Anarchism in Spain In 1793 Spain went to war against the revolutionary new French Republic as a member of the first Coalition The subsequent War of the Pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field peace was made with France in 1795 at the Peace of Basel in which Spain lost control over twothirds of the island of Hispaniola The Prime Minister Manuel Godoy then ensured that Spain allied herself with France in the brief War of the Third Coalition which ended with the British victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 In 1807 a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal Napoleons troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spains major fortresses The ridiculed Spanish king abdicated in favour of Napoleons brother Joseph Bonaparte Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the Napoleonic regime Napoleon was forced to intervene personally defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat However further military action by Spanish armies guerrillas and Wellingtons BritishPortuguese forces combined with Napoleons disastrous invasion of Russia led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from Spain in 1814 and the return of King Ferdinand VII During the war in 1810 a revolutionary body the Cortes of Cádiz was assembled to coordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution It met as one body and its members represented the entire Spanish empire In 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime Ferdinand VII dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries Spains conquest by France benefited Latin American anticolonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish governments policies that favoured Spanishborn citizens Peninsulars over those born overseas Criollos and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people Starting in 1809 Spains American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence leading to the Spanish American wars of independence that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas King Ferdinand VIIs attempt to reassert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and army revolts followed led by liberal officers By the end of 1826 the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined deeply divided and politically unstable In the 1830s and 1840s Antiliberal forces known as Carlists fought against liberals in the Carlist Wars Liberal forces won but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period After the Glorious Revolution of 1868 and the shortlived First Spanish Republic a more stable monarchic period began characterised by the practice of turnismo the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba In 1895 and 1896 the Cuban War of Independence and the Philippine Revolution broke out and eventually the United States became involved The Spanish–American War was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa El Desastre the Disaster as the war became known in Spain gave added impetus to the Generation of 98 who were conducting an analysis of the country Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity the 20th century brought little peace Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa with the colonisation of Western Sahara Spanish Morocco and Equatorial Guinea It remained neutral during World War I see Spain in World War I The heavy losses suffered during the Rif War in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera 1923–1931 ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic The Republic offered political autonomy to the linguistically distinct regions of Basque Country Catalonia and Galicia and gave voting rights to women Clara Campoamor suffragette leader Victoria Kent or Dolores Ibárruri were some of the first female deputies and Federica Montseny one of the first female ministers in the world In the worsening economic situation of the Great Depression Spanish politics became increasingly chaotic and violent Spanish Civil War and dictatorship Main articles Spanish Civil War Spanish Revolution of 1936 and Francoist Spain The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 For three years the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco and supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fought the Republican side which was supported by the Soviet Union Mexico and International Brigades but it was not supported by the Western powers due to the Britishled policy of NonIntervention The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides The war claimed the lives of over 500000 people and caused the flight of up to a halfmillion citizens from the country In 1939 General Franco emerged victorious and became a dictator The state as established under Franco was nominally neutral in the Second World War although sympathetic to the Axis The only legal party under Francos post civil war regime was the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS formed in 1937 the party emphasised falangism a form of fascism that emphasised anticommunism nationalism and Roman Catholicism Given Francos opposition to competing political parties the party was renamed the National Movement Movimiento Nacional in 1949 After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated and was kept out of the United Nations This changed in 1955 during the Cold War period when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin In the 1960s Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the creation of a mass tourism industry Francos rule was also characterised by authoritarianism promotion of a unitary national identity the favouring of a very conservative form of Roman Catholicism known as National Catholicism and discriminatory language policies In February 2016 the government of Spain announced it will rename streets named after Francos administration

crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha In the Basque Country moderate Basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed terrorist organisation ETA The group was formed in 1959 during Francos rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy On 23 February 1981 rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters via national television to surrender During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society New

that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office On 1 January 2002 Spain fully adopted the euro and Spain experienced strong economic growth well above the EU average during the early 2000s However well publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse In 2002 Prestige oil spill happened with big ecological consequences in the Spanish atlantic coastline In 2003 José María Aznar supported US president George W Bush in its preventive war against Sadam Hussein´s Iraq A strong movement against war rose in Spanish society On 11 March 2004 a local Islamist terrorist group inspired by AlQaeda carried out the largest terrorist attack in Spanish history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1800 others by bombing commuter trains in Madrid Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group ETA evidence soon emerged indicating Islamist involvement Because of the proximity of the 2004 election the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident At 14 March elections PSOE led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero won the elections The proportion of Spains foreign born population increased rapidly from around 1 in 50 in 2000 to almost 1 in 8 in 2010 but has since declined In 2005 the Spanish government legalised same sex marriage Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence Government talks with ETA happened and the band announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010 The bursting of the Spanish property bubble in 2008 led to the 2008–16 Spanish financial crisis and high levels of unemployment cuts in government spending and

which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level reason for which Köppen classification is often eschewed within Spain Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone which covers most of the country between warmwinter and coldwinter zones rather than according to summer temperatures The Csb zone has warm rather than hot summers and extends to additional coolwinter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate such as much of central and northerncentral of Spain eg western Castile–León northeastern CastillaLa Mancha and northern Madrid and into much rainier areas notably Galicia Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications but classed as oceanic The semiarid climate BSk BSh is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country but is also widespread in other areas of Spain It covers most of the Region of Murcia southern Valencia and eastern Andalusia where true hot desert climates also exist Further to the north it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the Ebro valley which crosses southern Navarre central Aragon and western Catalonia It also is found in Madrid Extremadura CastillaLa Mancha and some locations of western Andalusia The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude The oceanic climate Cfb located in the northern quarter of the country especially in the Atlantic region Basque Country Cantabria Asturias and partly Galicia and Castile–León Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre in most highlands areas along the Iberian System and in the Pyrenean valleys where a humid subtropical variant Cfa also occurs Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean and have no seasonal drought Apart from these main types other subtypes can be found like the alpine and continental climates Dfc Dfb Dsc Dsb in the Pyrenees as well as parts of the Cantabrian Range the Central System Sierra Nevada and the Iberian System and a typical desert climate BWk BWh in the zone of Almería Murcia and eastern Canary Islands Lowlying areas of the Canary Islands average above 180 °C 644 °F during their coldest month thus having a tropical climate Fauna and flora The fauna presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and Eurasia and the great diversity of habitats and biotopes the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief the climate and latitude Spain includes different phytogeographic regions each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate topography soil type and fire biotic factors Politics Main article Politics of Spain See also Spanish Constitution of 1978 According to the Democracy Index of the EIU Spain is one of the 20 full democracies in the world The Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the Spanish transition to democracy The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812 Impatient with the slow pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977 Spains new King Juan Carlos known for his formidable personality dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Suárez as Prime Minister The resulting general election in 1977 convened the Constituent Cortes the Spanish Parliament in its capacity as a constitutional assembly for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978 After a national referendum on 6 December 1978 88 of voters approved of the new constitution As a result Spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish The Spanish administration approved legislation in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life Gender Equality Act However in the legislative branch as of July 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the Congress were women 363 It places Spain 13th on a list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower house In the Senate the ratio is even lower since there are only 79 women out of 263 300 The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0794 12th in the world Government Main article Government of Spain See also List of Spanish monarchs and Monarchs of Spain family tree Spain is a constitutional monarchy with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament the Cortes Generales General Courts The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers of Spain presided over by the Prime Minister nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the Congress of Deputies following legislative elections By political custom established by King Juan Carlos since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution the kings nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress The legislative branch is made up of the Congress of Deputies Congreso de los Diputados with 350 members elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve fouryear terms and a Senate Senado with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve fouryear terms Head of State

socalled Estado de las Autonomías State of Autonomies it is one of the most decentralised countries in Europe along with Switzerland Germany and Belgium for example all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments governments public administrations budgets and resources Health and education systems among others are managed regionally and in addition the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions In Catalonia the Basque Country Navarre and the Canary Islands a fullfledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the State police functions see Mossos dEsquadra Ertzaintza Policía Foral and Policía Canaria Human rights Main article Human rights in Spain See also LGBT rights in Spain The Government respects the human rights of its citizens although there are a few problems in some areas the law and judiciary provide effective means of addressing individual instances of abuse There are allegations that a few members of the security forces abused detainees and mistreated foreigners and illegal immigrants According to Amnesty International AI government investigations of such alleged abuses are often lengthy and punishments were light Violence against women was a problem which the Government took steps to address Spain provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its LGBT community Among

divisions Main article Political divisions of Spain The Spanish State is integrated by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities both groups being the highest or firstorder administrative division in the country Autonomous communities are integrated by provinces of which there are 50 in total and in turn provinces are integrated by municipalities In Catalonia two additional divisions exist the comarques sing comarca and the vegueries sing vegueria both of which have administrative powers comarques being aggregations of municipalities and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques The concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities however unlike Catalonia these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions Autonomous communities Main article Autonomous communities of Spain See also Nationalities and regions of Spain Galicia Navarre Madrid La Rioja Aragon Catalonia Valencia Castilla La Mancha Extremadura Portugal Castile and León Asturias Cantabria Basque Country Murcia Andalusia Ceuta Melilla France Balearic Islands Canary Islands Mediterranean Sea Bay of Biscay Atlantic Ocean Andorra Atlantic Ocean Gibraltar UK Spains autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country They were created after the current constitution came into effect in 1978 in recognition of the right to selfgovernment of the nationalities and regions of Spain The autonomous communities were to be integrated into adjacent provinces with common historical cultural and economical traits This territorial organisation based on devolution is literally known in Spain as the State of Autonomies The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity the limits of its territories the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution The governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers comprising a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by universal suffrage according to the system of proportional representation and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented a government council with executive and administrative functions headed by a president elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the King of Spain a supreme court under the supreme court of Spain which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community Catalonia Galicia and the Basque Country which identified themselves as nationalities were granted selfgovernment through a rapid process Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country Progressively other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities such as the Valencian Community the Canary Islands the Balearic Islands and Aragon The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy with their own parliaments and regional governments The distribution of powers may be different for every community as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy Aside of fiscal autonomy the nationalities—Andalusia the Basque Country Catalonia and Galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time In addition the Basque Country Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own Ertzaintza Mossos dEsquadra and the Policía Foral respectively Other communities have more limited forces or none at all like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid Nonetheless recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions Finally along with the 17 autonomous communities two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are firstorder territorial divisions Ceuta and Melilla These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast Provinces and municipalities Main articles Provinces of Spain and Municipalities of Spain Autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces which served as their territorial building blocks In turn provinces are integrated by municipalities The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the 1833 territorial division by Javier de Burgos and in all the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces The communities of Asturias Cantabria La Rioja the Balearic Islands Madrid Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province which is coextensive with the community itself In these cases the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community Foreign relations Main article Foreign relations of Spain After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975 Spains foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations enter the European Community and define security relations with the West As a member of NATO since 1982 Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities Spains EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy Even on many international issues beyond western Europe Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political cooperation mechanisms Spain has maintained its special relations with Hispanic America and the Philippines Its policy emphasises the concept of an IberoAmerican community essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of Hispanidad or Hispanismo as it is often referred to in English which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language commerce history and culture Spain claims Gibraltar a 6squarekilometre 23 sq mi Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula Then a Spanish town it was conquered by an AngloDutch force in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of Archduke Charles pretender to the Spanish throne The legal situation concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown stating that should the British abandon this post it would be offered to Spain first Since the 1940s Spain has called for the return of Gibraltar The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this along with any proposal of shared sovereignty UN resolutions call on the United Kingdom and Spain both EU members to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht Spain asserts that the occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of International Law The United Kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus as there has been continuous possession of the isthmus over a long period Another claim by Spain is about the Savage Islands a claim not recognised by Portugal Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands therefore claiming that there is no Portuguese territorial waters around the disputed islands On 5 July 2013 Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views Spain claims the sovereignty over the Perejil Island a small uninhabited rocky islet located in the South shore of the Strait of Gibraltar The island lies 250 metres 820 ft just off the coast of Morocco 8 kilometres 50 mi from Ceuta and 135 kilometres 84 mi from mainland Spain Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002 The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty Besides the Perejil Island the Spanishheld territories claimed by other countries are two Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of Africa and Portugal does not recognise Spains sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza Military Main article Spanish Armed Forces The armed forces of Spain are known as the Spanish Armed Forces Fuerzas Armadas Españolas Their Commanderinchief is the King of Spain Felipe VI The Spanish Armed Forces are divided into three branches Army Ejército de Tierra Navy Armada Air Force Ejército del Aire Economy Main article Economy of Spain Spains capitalist mixed economy is the 16th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the European Union as well as the Eurozones 4th largest The centreright government of former prime minister José María Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999 Unemployment stood at 76 in October 2006 a rate that compared favourably to many other European countries and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20 Perennial weak points of Spains economy include high inflation a large underground economy and an education system which OECD reports place among the poorest for developed countries together with the United States and UK By the mid1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spains high unemployment began to drop steadily With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999 Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there after the United States Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia especially China and India This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets Spanish companies invested in fields like renewable energy commercialisation Iberdrola was the worlds largest renewable energy operator technology companies like Telefónica Abengoa Mondragon Corporation Movistar Hisdesat Indra train manufacturers like CAF Talgo global corporations such as the textile company Inditex petroleum companies like Repsol and infrastructure with six of the ten biggest international construction firms specialising in transport being Spanish like Ferrovial Acciona ACS OHL and FCC In 2005 the Economist Intelligence Units quality of life survey placed Spain among the top 10 in the world In 2013 the same survey now called the Wheretobeborn index ranked Spain 28th in the world In 2010 the Basque city of Bilbao was awarded with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize and its mayor at the time Iñaki Azkuna was awarded the World Mayor Prize in 2012 The Basque capital city of VitoriaGasteiz received the European Green Capital Award in 2012 Agriculture Main article Agriculture in Spain Crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners Areas relying on nonirrigated cultivation secano which made up 85 of the entire crop area depended solely on rainfall as a source of water They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation regadío accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986 and the government hoped that this area would eventually double as it already had doubled since 1950 Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe Though only about 17 of Spains cultivated land was irrigated it was estimated to be the source of between 40–45 of the gross value of crop production and of 50 of the value of agricultural exports More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn fruit trees and vegetables Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes cotton sugar beets potatoes legumes olive trees mangos strawberries tomatoes and fodder grasses Depending on the nature of the crop it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10 of the countrys irrigated land Citrus fruits vegetables cereal grains olive oil and wine—Spains traditional agricultural products—continued to be important in the 1980s In 1983 they represented 12 12 8 6 and 4 respectively of the countrys agricultural production Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock poultry and dairy products Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity accounting for 30 of all farmrelated production in 1983 Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains Ideal growing conditions combined with proximity to important north European markets made citrus fruits Spains leading export Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community Tourism Main article Tourism in Spain The climate of Spain its geographic location popular coastlines diverse landscapes historical legacy vibrant culture and excellent infrastructure has made Spains international tourist industry among the largest in the world In the last five decades international tourism in Spain has grown to become the second largest in the world in terms of spending worth approximately 40 billion Euros or about 5 of GDP in 2006 Energy Main article Energy in Spain Spain is one of the worlds leading countries in the development and production of renewable energy In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida near Alvarado Badajoz Spain is also Europes main producer of wind energy In 2010 its wind turbines generated 42976 GWh which accounted for 164 of all electrical energy produced in Spain On 9 November 2010 wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53 of mainland electricity demand and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors Other renewable energies used in Spain are hydroelectric biomass and marine 2 power plants under construction Nonrenewable energy sources used in Spain are nuclear 8 operative reactors gas coal and oil Fossil fuels together generated 58 of Spains electricity in 2009 just below the OECD mean of 61 Nuclear power generated another 19 and wind and hydro about 12 each Transport Main article Transport in Spain The Spanish road system is mainly centralised with six highways connecting Madrid to the Basque Country Catalonia Valencia West Andalusia Extremadura and Galicia Additionally there are highways along the Atlantic Ferrol to Vigo Cantabrian Oviedo to San Sebastián and Mediterranean Girona to Cádiz coasts Spain aims to put one million electric cars on the road by 2014 as part of the governments plan to save energy and boost energy efficiency The former Minister of Industry Miguel Sebastián said that the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution Spain has the most extensive highspeed rail network in Europe and the secondmost extensive in the world after China As of October 2010 Spain has a total of 3500 km 217480 mi of highspeed tracks linking Málaga Seville Madrid Barcelona Valencia and Valladolid with the trains reaching speeds up to 300 kmh 190 mph On average the Spanish highspeed train is the fastest one in the world followed by the Japanese bullet train and the French TGV Regarding punctuality it is second in the world 9854 ontime arrival after the Japanese Shinkansen 99 Should the aims of the ambitious AVE programme Spanish high speed trains be met by 2020 Spain will have 7000 km 4300 mi of highspeed trains linking almost all provincial cities to Madrid in less than three hours and Barcelona within four hours There are 47 public airports in Spain The busiest one is the airport of Madrid Barajas with 50 million passengers in 2011 being the worlds 15th busiest airport as well as the European Unions fourth busiest The airport of Barcelona El Prat is also important with 35 million passengers in 2011 being the worlds 31stbusiest airport Other main airports are located in Majorca 23 million passengers Málaga 13 million passengers Las Palmas Gran Canaria 11 million passengers Alicante 10 million passengers and smaller with the number of passengers between 4 and 10 million for example Tenerife two airports Valencia Seville Bilbao Ibiza Lanzarote Fuerteventura Also more than 30 airports with the number of passengers below 4 million Science and technology Main article Science and technology in Spain In the 19th and 20th centuries science in Spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment Despite the conditions some important scientists and engineers emerged The most notable were Miguel Servet Santiago Ramón y Cajal Narcís Monturiol Celedonio Calatayud Juan de la Cierva Leonardo Torres y Quevedo Margarita Salas and Severo Ochoa Water supply and sanitation Main article Water supply and sanitation in Spain Water supply and sanitation in Spain is characterised by universal access and generally good service quality while tariffs are among the lowest in the EU Almost half of the population is served by private or mixed privatepublic water companies which operate under concession contracts with municipalities The largest of the private water companies with a market share of about 50 of the private concessions is Aguas de Barcelona Agbar However the large cities are all served by public companies except Barcelona and Valencia The largest public company is Canal de Isabel II which serves the metropolitan area of Madrid Droughts affect water supply in Southern Spain which increasingly is turning towards seawater desalination to meet its water needs Demographics Main article Demographics of Spain See also List of Spanish autonomous communities by population In 2008 the population of Spain officially reached 46 million people as recorded by the Padrón municipal Spains Municipal Register Spains population density at 91km² 235sq mi is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal With the exception of the region surrounding the capital Madrid the most populated areas lie around the coast The population of Spain more than doubled since 1900 when it stood at 186 million principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s Native Spaniards make up 88 of the total population of Spain After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spains population growth rate dropped the population again trended upward based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s and more recently fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12 of the population The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America 39 North Africa 16 Eastern Europe 15 and SubSaharan Africa 4 In 2005 Spain instituted a threemonth amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency In 2008 Spain granted citizenship to 84170 persons mostly to people from Ecuador Colombia and Morocco A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries These are mostly British French German Dutch and Norwegian They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world most notably in Latin America Beginning in the late 15th century large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most white Latin Americans who make up about onethird of Latin Americas population are of Spanish or Portuguese origin Around 240000 Spaniards emigrated in the 16th century mostly to Peru and Mexico Another 450000 left in the 17th century Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas especially to Argentina and Brazil Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 and 1975 During the same period perhaps 300000 went to Latin America Urbanisation Main article List of metropolitan areas in Spain Source Áreas urbanas 50 Ministry of Public Works and Transport 2013 Peoples Main articles Spanish people and Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain The Spanish Constitution of 1978 in its second article recognises contemporary entities—nationalities a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged nations—and regions within the context of the Spanish nation For some people Spains identity consists more of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity Indeed some of the territorial identities may even conflict with the Spanish one Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques Catalans Galicians Andalusians and Valencians although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct local identity It is this last feature of shared identity between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal Minority groups Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies especially Latin America and North Africa Smaller numbers of immigrants from several SubSaharan countries have recently been settling in Spain There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants most of whom are of Middle Eastern South Asian and Chinese origin The single largest group of immigrants are European represented by large numbers of Romanians Britons Germans French and others The arrival of the gitanos a Romani people began in the 16th century estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750000 to over one million There are also the mercheros also quinquis a formerly nomadic minority group Their origin is unclear Historically Sephardi Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originated in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardi Jews Immigration Main article Immigration to Spain According to the Spanish government there were 57 million foreign residents in Spain in 2011 or 12 of the total population According to residence permit data for 2011 more than 860000 were Romanian about 770000 were Moroccan approximately 390000 were British and 360000 were Ecuadorian Other sizeable foreign communities are Colombian Bolivian German Italian Bulgarian and Chinese There are more than 200000 migrants from SubSaharan Africa living in Spain principally Senegaleses and Nigerians Since 2000 Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level This sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants particularly those arriving illegally by sea has caused noticeable social tension Within the EU Spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after Cyprus but by a great margin the highest in absolute numbers up to 2008 The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500000 people in 1996 to 52 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million In 2005 alone a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700000 people There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration including Spains cultural ties with Latin America its geographical position the porosity of its borders the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spains Mediterranean coast In fact Spain was Europes largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007 with its immigrant population more than doubling as 25 million people arrived In 2008 prior to the onset of the economic crisis the Financial Times reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU In 2008 the government instituted a Plan of Voluntary Return which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security The programme had little effect during its first two months just 1400 immigrants took up the offer What the programme failed to do the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs In 2011 alone more than half a million people left Spain For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners Languages Main article Languages of Spain Spain is openly multilingual and the constitution establishes that the nation will protect all Spaniards and the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights their cultures and traditions languages and institutions Spanish español—officially recognised in the constitution as Castilian castellano—is the official language of the entire country and it is the right and duty of every Spaniard to know the language The constitution also establishes that all other Spanish languages—that is all other languages of Spain—will also be official in their respective autonomous communities in accordance to their Statutes their organic regional legislations and that the richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection The other official languages of Spain coofficial with Spanish are Basque euskara in the Basque Country and Navarre Catalan català in Catalonia the Balearic Islands and in the Valencian Community where its distinct modality of the language is officially known as Valencian valencià and Galician galego in Galicia As a percentage of the general population Basque is spoken by 2 Catalan or Valencian by 17 and Galician by 7 of all Spaniards In Catalonia Aranese aranés a local variety of the Occitan language has been declared coofficial along with Catalan and Spanish since 2006 It is spoken only in the comarca of Val dAran by roughly 6700 people Other Romance minority languages though not official have special recognition such as the AsturLeonese group Asturian – asturianu also called bable – in Asturias and Leonese – llionés – in Castile and León and Aragonese aragonés in Aragon In the North African Spanish autonomous city of Melilla Riff Berber is spoken by a significant part of the population In the tourist areas of the Mediterranean coast and the islands English and German are widely spoken by tourists foreign residents and tourism workers Education Main article Education in Spain State education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen The current education system was established by the 2006 educational law LOE Ley Orgánica de Educación or Fundamental Law for the Education In 2014 the LOE was partially modified by the newer and controversial LOMCE law Ley Orgánica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa or Fundamental Law for the Improvement of the Education System commonly called Ley Wert Wert Law Since 1970 to 2014 Spain has had seven different educational laws LGE LOECE LODE LOGSE LOPEG LOE and LOMCE Institución Libre de Enseñanza was an educational project that developed in Spain for the half a century of about 1876–1936 by Francisco Giner de los Ríos and Gumersindo de Azcárate The institute was inspired by the philosophy of Krausism Concepción Arenal in feminism and Santiago Ramón y Cajal in neuroscience were in the movement Health Main article Health care in Spain The health care system of Spain Spanish National Health System is considered one of the best in the world in 7th position in the ranking elaborated by the World Health Organization The health care is public universal and free for any legal citizen of Spain The total health spending is 94 of the GDP slightly above the average of 93 of the OECD Religion Main article Religion in Spain See also Christianity in Spain Islam in Spain Judaism in Spain Hinduism in Spain and Baháí Faith in Spain Roman Catholicism has long been the main religion of Spain and although it no longer has official status by law in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught although the teaching of Islam Judaism and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 68 of Spaniards selfidentify as Catholics 2 other faith and about 27 identify with no religion Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious 59 hardly ever or never go to church 16 go to church some times a year 9 some time per month and 15 every Sunday or multiple times per week Recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20 to 27 of the Spanish population Altogether about 9 of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades the influx of Latin American immigrants who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners has helped the Catholic Church to recover There have been four Spanish Popes Damasus I Calixtus III Alexander VI and Benedict XIII Spanish mysticism was an important intellectual fight against Protestantism with Teresa of Ávila a reformist nun ahead The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius of Loyola and Francisco Javier In the 60s of the 20th century Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacuría were inside the movement of Liberation Theology Protestant churches have about 1200000 members There are about 105000 Jehovahs Witnesses The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints has approximately 46000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the Moratalaz District of Madrid A study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1700000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012 accounting for 3–4 of the total population of Spain The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries More than 514000 30 of them had Spanish nationality The recent

life Other major plays from the medieval times were Mester de Juglaría Mester de Clerecía Coplas por la muerte de su padre or El Libro de buen amor The Book of Good Love During the Renaissance the major plays are La Celestina and El Lazarillo de Tormes while many religious literature was created with poets as Luis de León San Juan de la Cruz Santa Teresa de Jesús etc The Baroque is the most important period for Spanish culture We are in the times of the Spanish Empire The famous Don Quijote de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time Other writers from the period are Francisco de Quevedo Lope de Vega Calderón de la Barca or Tirso de Molina During the Enlightenment we find names such as Leandro Fernández de Moratín Benito Jerónimo Feijóo Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos or Leandro Fernández de Moratín During the Romanticism José Zorrilla created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in Don Juan Tenorio Other writers from this period are Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer José de Espronceda Rosalía de Castro or Mariano José de Larra In Realism we find names such as Benito Pérez Galdós Emilia Pardo Bazán Leopoldo Alas Clarín Concepción Arenal Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and Menéndez Pelayo Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society as they were In the spirit of general Realism Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of romanticised or stylised presentations The group that has become known as the Generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of Spains fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898 which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain The Disaster of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political economic and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of Regeneracionismo For a group of younger writers among them Miguel de Unamuno Pío Baroja and José Martínez Ruiz Azorín the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper more radical literary shift that affected both form and content These writers along with Ramón del ValleInclán Antonio Machado Ramiro de Maeztu and Ángel Ganivet came to be known as the Generation of 98 The Generation of 1914 or Novecentismo The next supposed generation of Spanish writers following those of 98 already calls into question the value of such terminology By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generations leading voice José Ortega y Gasset—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field Leading voices include the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez the academics and essayists Ramón Menéndez Pidal Gregorio Marañón Manuel Azaña Maria Zambrano Eugeni dOrs Clara Campoamor and Ortega y Gasset and the novelists Gabriel Miró Ramón Pérez de Ayala and Ramón Gómez de la Serna While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of 98 they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity Salvador de Madariaga another prominent intellectual and writer was one of the founders of the College of Europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the Liberal International The Generation of 1927 where poets Pedro Salinas Jorge Guillén Federico García Lorca Vicente Aleixandre Dámaso Alonso All were scholars of their national literary heritage again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards The two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Camilo José Cela and Miguel Delibes from Generation of 36 Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the Nobel Prize in Literature and with Latin American laureates they made the Spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all The Spanish writers

founded by the Romans and with an extensive Roman era infrastructure Córdoba became the cultural capital including fine Arabic style architecture during the time of the Islamic Umayyad dynasty Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties ending with the Nasrid which built its famed palace complex in Granada Simultaneously the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles developing a preRomanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages they later integrated the Romanesque and Gothic streams There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory The Mudéjar style from the 12th to 17th centuries was developed by introducing Arab style motifs patterns and elements into European architecture The arrival of Modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century An influential style centred in Barcelona known as modernisme produced a number of important architects of which Gaudí is one The International style was led by groups like GATEPAC Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and Spanish architects like Rafael Moneo Santiago Calatrava Ricardo Bofill
