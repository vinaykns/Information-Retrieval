 Land development refers to altering the landscape in any number of ways such as Changing landforms from a natural or seminatural state for a purpose such as agriculture or housing Subdividing real estate into lots typically for the purpose of building homes Real estate development or changing its purpose for example by converting an unused factory complex into condominia Economic aspects In an economics context land development is also sometimes advertised as land improvement or land amelioration It refers to investments making land more usable by humans For accounting purposes it refers to any variety of projects that increase the value of the property Most are depreciable but some land improvements are not able to be depreciated because a useful life cannot be determined Home building and containment are two of the most common and the oldest types of development In an urban context land development furthermore includes Road construction Access roads walkways and parking lots Bridging Landscaping Clearing terracing or land levelling Setup of fences and to a lesser degree hedges Service connections to municipal services and public utilities Drainage canals External lighting street lamps etc Landowner or developers on any size of project will often want to maximise profits minimise risk and control cash flow This profit enhancement means identifying and developing the best scheme for the local marketplace whilst satisfying the local planning process Development Analysis puts development prospects and the development process itself under the microscope identifying where enhancements and improvements can be introduced These improvements aim to align with best design practice political sensitivities and the inevitable social requirements of a project with the overarching objective of increasing land values and profit margins on behalf of the landowner or developer Development analysis can add significantly to the value of land and development and as such is a crucial tool for landowners and developers It is an essential step in Kevin A Lynchs 1960 book The Image of the City and is considered to be essential to realizing the value potential of land The landowner can share in additional planning gain significant value uplift via an awareness of the lands development potential This is done via a residual development appraisal or residual valuation The residual appraisal calculates the sale value of the end product the Gross Development Value or GDV and hypothetically deducts costs including planning and construction costs finance costs and developers profit The residue or leftover proportion represents the land value Therefore in maximising the GDV that which one could build on the land land value is concurrently enhanced Land value is highly sensitive to supply and demand for the end product build costs planning and affordable housing contributions and so on Understanding the intricacies of the development system and the effect of value drivers can result in massive differences in the landowners sale value Conversion of landforms Land development puts more emphasis on the expected economic development as a result of the process land conversion tries to focus on the general physical and biological aspects of the land use change Land improvement in the economic sense can often lead to land degradation from the ecological perspective Land development and the change in land value does not usually take into account changes in the ecology of the developed area While conversion of rural land with a vegetation carpet to building land may result in a rise in economic growth and rising land prices the irreversibility of lost flora and fauna because of habitat destruction the loss of ecosystem services and resulting decline in environmental value is only considered a priori in environmental fullcost accounting Conversion to building land Conversion to building land is as a rule associated with road building which in itself already brings topsoil abrasion soil compaction and modification of the soils chemical composition through soil stabilization creation of impervious surfaces and subsequently polluted surface runoff water Construction activity often effectively seals off a larger part of the soil from rainfall and the nutrient cycle so that the soil below buildings and roads is effectively consumed and made infertile With the notable exception of attempts at rooftop gardening and hanging gardens in green buildings possibly as constituents of green urbanism vegetative cover of higher plants is lost to concrete and asphalt surfaces complementary interspersed garden and park areas notwithstanding Conversion to farmland New creation of farmland will rely on the conversion and development of previous forests savannas or grassland Recreation of farmland from wasteland deserts or previous impervious surfaces is considerably less frequent because of the degraded or missing fertile soil in the latter Starting from forests land is made arable by assarting or slashandburn Agricultural development furthermore includes Hydrological measures land levelling drainage irrigation sometimes landslide and flood control Soil improvement fertilization establishment of a productive chemical balance Road construction Because the newly created farmland is more prone to erosion than soil stabilized by tree roots such a conversion may mean irreversible crossing of an ecological threshold See also Horton overland flow The resulting deforestation is also not easily compensated for by reforestation or afforestation This is because plantations of other trees as a means for water conservation and protection against wind erosion shelterbelts as a rule lack the biodiversity of the lost forest especially when realized as monocultures Also soil stabilization and erosion control measures may not be as effective in preserving topsoil as the previous intact vegetation Restoration Massive land conversion without proper consideration of ecological and geological consequences may lead to disastrous results such as General soil degradation Catastrophic soil salination and solonchak formation eg in Central Asia as a consequence of irrigation by saline groundwater Desertification soil erosion and ecological shifts due to drainage Leaching of saline soils Habitat loss for the wildlife While deleterious effects can be particularly visible when land is developed for industrial or mining usage agroindustrial and settlement use can also have a massive and sometimes irreversible impact on the affected ecosystem Examples of land restorationland rehabilitation counted as land development in the strict sense are still rare However renaturation reforestation stream restoration may all contribute to a healthier environment and quality of life especially in densely populated regions The same is true for planned vegetation like parks and gardens but restoration plays a particular role because it reverses previous conversions to built and agricultural areas Further information land recycling soil conservation soil salinity control environmental remediation
