 In radiometry irradiance is the radiant flux power received by a surface per unit area The SI unit of irradiance is the watt per square metre Wm The CGS unit erg per square centimetre per second erg·cm·s is often used in astronomy Irradiance is often called intensity in branches of physics other than radiometry but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity Spectral irradiance is the irradiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength The two forms have different dimensions spectral irradiance of a frequency spectrum is measured in watts per square metre per hertz W·m·Hz while spectral irradiance of a wavelength spectrum is measured in watts per square metre per metre W·m or more commonly watts per square metre per nanometre W·m·nm Mathematical definitions Irradiance Irradiance of a surface denoted Ee e for energetic to avoid confusion with photometric quantities is defined as where ∂ is the partial derivative symbol Φe is the radiant flux received A is the area If we want to talk about the radiant flux emitted by a surface we speak of radiant exitance Spectral irradiance Spectral irradiance in frequency of a surface denoted Eeν is defined as where ν is the frequency Spectral irradiance in wavelength of a surface denoted Eeλ is defined as where λ is the wavelength Property Irradiance of a surface is also according to the definition of radiant flux equal to the timeaverage of the component of the Poynting vector perpendicular to the surface where • is the timeaverage S is the Poynting vector α is the angle between a unit vector normal to the surface and S For a propagating sinusoidal linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave the Poynting vector always points to the direction of propagation while oscillating in magnitude The irradiance of a surface is then given by where Em is the amplitude of the waves electric field n is the refractive index of the medium of propagation c is the speed of light in vacuum μ0 is the vacuum permeability ε0 is the vacuum permittivity This formula assumes that the magnetic susceptibility is negligible ie that μr ≈ 1 where μr is the magnetic permeability of the propagation medium This assumption is typically valid in transparent media in the optical frequency range Solar energy The global irradiance on a horizontal surface on Earth consists of the direct irradiance Eedir and diffuse irradiance Eediff On a tilted plane there is another irradiance component Eerefl which is the component that is reflected from the ground The average ground reflection is about 20 of the global irradiance Hence the irradiance Ee on a tilted plane consists of three components The integral of solar irradiance over a time period is called solar exposure or insolation SI radiometry units SI radiometry units v t e See also Illuminance Spectral flux density Albedo Fluence Insolation Light diffusion PI curve photosynthesisirradiance curve Solar azimuth angle Solar irradiance Solar noon Stefan–Boltzmann law References
