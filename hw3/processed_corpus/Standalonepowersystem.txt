 A standalone power system SAPS or SPS also known as remote area power supply RAPS is an offthegrid electricity system for locations that are not fitted with an electricity distribution system Typical SAPS include one or more methods of electricity generation energy storage and regulation Electricity is typically generated by one or more of the following methods Photovoltaic system using solar panels Wind turbine Geothermal source Micro combined heat and power Micro hydro Diesel or biofuel generator Thermoelectric generator TEGs Storage is typically implemented as a battery bank but other solutions exist including fuel cells Power drawn directly from the battery will be direct current extra low voltage DC ELV and this is used especially for lighting as well as for DC appliances An inverter is used to generate AC low voltage which more typical appliances can be used with Standalone photovoltaic power systems are independent of the utility grid and may use solar panels only or may be used in conjunction with a diesel generator a wind turbine or batteries Types The two types of standalone photovoltaic power systems are directcoupled system without batteries and stand alone system with batteries Directcoupled system The basic model of a direct coupled system consists of a solar panel connected directly to a dc load As there are no battery banks in this setup energy is not stored and hence it is capable of powering common appliances like fans pumps etc only during the day MPPTs are generally used to efficiently utilize the Suns energy especially for electrical loads like positivedisplacement water pumps Impedance matching is also considered as a design criterion in directcoupled systems Stand alone system with batteries In standalone photovoltaic power systems the electrical energy produced by the photovoltaic panels cannot always be used directly As the demand from the load does not always equal the solar panel capacity battery banks are generally used The primary functions of a storage battery in a standalone PV system are Energy Storage Capacity and Autonomy To store energy when there is an excess is available and to provide it when required Voltage and Current Stabilization To provide stable current and voltage by eradicating transients Supply Surge Currents to provide surge currents to loads like motors when required Hybrid system See also Hybrid power Hybrid renewable energy system Solar hybrid power system and Wind hybrid power system The hybrid power plant is a complete electrical power supply system that can be easily configured to meet a broad range of remote power needs There are three basic elements to the system the power source the battery and the power management center Sources for hybrid power include wind turbines diesel engine generators thermoelectric generators and solar PV systems The battery allows autonomous operation by compensating for the difference between power production and use The power management center regulates power production from each of the sources controls power use by classifying loads and protects the battery from service extremes System monitoring Monitoring photovoltaic systems can provide useful information about their operation and what should be done to improve performance but if the data are not reported properly the effort is wasted To be helpful a monitoring report must provide information on the relevant aspects of the operation in terms that are easily understood by a third party Appropriate performance parameters need to be selected and their values consistently updated with each new issue of the report In some cases it may be beneficial to monitor the performance of individual components in order to refine and improve system performance or be alerted to loss of performance in time for preventative action For example monitoring battery chargedischarge profiles will signal when replacement is due before downtime from system failure is experienced IEC standard 61724 IEC has provided a set of monitoring standards called the Standard for Photovoltaic system performance monitoring IEC 61724 It focusses on the photovoltaic systems electrical performance and it does not address hybrids or prescribe a method for ensuring that performance assessments are equitable Performance assessment Performance assessment involves Data collection which is a straightforward process of measuring parameters Evaluation of that data in a manner that provides useful information Dissemination of useful information to the end user Load related problems The wide range of load related problems identified are classified into the following types Wrong selection Some loads cannot be used with standalone PV systems House wiring Inadequate or low quality wiring and protection devices can affect the systems response Low efficiency Low efficiency loads may increase energy consumption Standby loads Standby mode of some loads waste energy Startup High current drawn by some loads during startup Current spikes during the startup can overload the system temporarily Reactive power The circulating current can differ from the current consumed when capacitive or inductive loads are used Harmonic distortion Nonlinear loads may create distortion of the inverter waveform Mismatch between load and inverter size When a higher rated inverter is used for a lower capacity load overall efficiency is reduced Gallery Solar powered parking meter See also Renewable energy portal Energy portal Australian Greenhouse Office Buildingintegrated photovoltaics Distributed generation
