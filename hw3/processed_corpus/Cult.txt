 For other uses see Cult disambiguation The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious spiritual or philosophical beliefs or common interest in a particular personality object or goal The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study In the sociological classifications of religious movements a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices although this is often unclear Other researchers present a lessorganized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices The word cult has always been controversial because it is in a pejorative sense considered a subjective term used as an ad hominem attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices Groups said to be cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions Beginning in the 1930s cults became the object of sociological study in the context of the study of religious behavior From the 1940s the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements and labelled them as cults for their unChristian unorthodox beliefs The secular anticult movement began in the 1970s and opposed certain groups often charging them with mind control and partly motivated in reaction to acts of violence committed by some of their members Some of the claims and actions of the anticult movements have been disputed by scholars and by the news media leading to further public controversy The term new religious movement refers to religions which have appeared since the mid1800s Many but not all have been considered to be cults Subcategories of cults include Doomsday cults political cults destructive cults racist cults polygamist cults and terrorist cults Governmental reactions to cultrelated issues have also been a source of controversy Terminological history Further information Cult religious practice Sociological classifications of religious movements Holiness movement Faith healing Anticult movement and ritual abuse panic The word cult was originally used not to describe a group of religionists but for the act of worship or religious ceremony It was first used in the early 17th century borrowed via the French culte from Latin cultus worship This in turn was derived from the adjective cultus inhabited cultivated worshiped based on the verb colere care cultivate The word culture is also derived from the Latin words cultura and cultus which in general terms refers to the customary beliefs social forms and material traits of a religious or social group While the literal sense of the word in English is still in use a derived sense of excessive devotion arose in the 19th century The terms cult and cultist came to be used in medical literature in the United States in the 1930s for what would now be termed faith healing especially for the US Holiness movement This experienced a surge of popularity at the time but extended to other forms of alternative medicine as well In the English speaking world the word often carries derogatory connotations but in other European languages it is used as English speakers use the word religion sometimes causing confusion for English speakers reading material translated from other languages When actually referring to what would be defined as a cult in English the word sect or similar cognate is normally used By the late 1930s the Christian countercult movement began applying the term cult to what would formerly have been termed heresy This usage became mainstream by the 1960s via the bestselling The Kingdom of the Cults 1965 This terminological development which had so far been characteristic of the religious sociology of the United States entered international use with the ritual abuse moral panic of the 1980s which originated in the United States The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the international spread throughout most of the Englishspeaking world and some parts of Europe Also from the 1990s as part of the discrimination discourse at the height of the US culture war US neopagan religions especially Wicca began to protest through literature their classification as cults as discriminatory Because of this usage of cult began to be discouraged in favour of the neutral new religious movement in sociological literature Proponents of such an approach have sometimes been denounced as procult apologists by members of the anticult movement Most sociologists and scholars of religion also began to reject the word cult altogether because of its negative connotations in mass culture Some began to advocate the use of new terms like new religious movement alternative religion or novel religion to describe most of the groups that had come to be referred to as cults yet none of these terms have had much success in popular culture or in the media Other scholars have pushed to redeem the word cult as one fit for neutral academic discourse In a survey study containing 258 participants negative perceptions of the terms new religious movement cult and satanic cult were found However these terms differed significantly ie not due to chance in how negatively the participants perceived them New religious movement was found to be the most favourable term followed by cult and then Satanic cult New religious movements Main article New religious movement A new religious movement NRM is a religious community or spiritual group of modern origins since the mid1800s which has a peripheral place within its societys dominant religious culture NRMs can be novel in origin or part of a wider religion in which case they are distinct from preexisting denominations Scholars have estimated that NRMs of which some but not all have been labelled as cults number in the tens of thousands worldwide most of which originated in Asia or Africa The great majority have only a few members some have thousands and only very few have more than a million In 2007 religious scholar Elijah Siegler commented that although no NRM had become the dominant faith in any country many of the concepts which they had first introduced often referred to as New Age ideas have become part of worldwide mainstream culture Scholarly studies Sociologist Max Weber 1864–1920 found that cults based on charismatic leadership often follow the routinization of charisma The concept of a cult as a sociological classification was introduced in 1932 by American sociologist Howard P Becker as an expansion of German theologian Ernst Troeltschs churchsect typology Troeltschs aim was to distinguish between three main types of religious behavior churchly sectarian and mystical Becker created four categories out of Troeltschs first two by splitting church into ecclesia and denomination and sect into sect and cult Like Troeltschs mystical religion Beckers cults were small religious groups lacking in organization and emphasizing the private nature of personal beliefs Later sociological formulations built on these characteristics placing an additional emphasis on cults as deviant religious groups deriving their inspiration from outside of the predominant religious culture This is often thought to lead to a high degree of tension between the group and the more mainstream culture surrounding it a characteristic shared with religious sects In this sociological terminology sects are products of religious schism and therefore maintain a continuity with traditional beliefs and practices while cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices In the early 1960s sociologist John Lofland lived with South Korean missionary Young Oon Kim and some of the first American Unification Church members in California during which he studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members often family relationships Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled The World Savers A Field Study of Cult Processes and in 1966 in book form by PrenticeHall as Doomsday Cult A Study of Conversion Proselytization and Maintenance of Faith It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion Sociologist Roy Wallis 1945–1990 argued that a cult is characterized by epistemological individualism meaning that the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member Cults according to Wallis are generally described as oriented towards the problems of individuals loosely structured tolerant and nonexclusive making few demands on members without possessing a clear distinction between members and nonmembers having a rapid turnover of membership and as being transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the cultic milieu In 1978 Bruce Campbell noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a divine element in the individual It is either Soul Self or True Self Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized There is a major theme in many of the recent works that show the relationship between cults and mysticism Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention One is mystical and the other is instrumental This can divide the cults into being either occult or metaphysical assemblies On the basis that Campbell proposes about cults they are nontraditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual There is also a third type This is serviceoriented Campbell states that the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders Dick Anthony a forensic psychologist known for his criticism of brainwashing theory of conversion has defended some socalled cults and in 1988 argued that involvement in such movements may often have beneficial rather than harmful effects saying Theres a large research literature published in mainstream journals on the mental health effects of new religions For the most part the effects seem to be positive in any way thats measurable In their 1996 book Theory of Religion American sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge propose that the formation of cults can be explained through the rational choice theory In The Future of Religion they comment in the beginning all religions are obscure tiny deviant cult movements According to Marc Galanter Professor of Psychiatry at NYU typical reasons why people join cults include a search for community and a spiritual quest Stark and Bainbridge in discussing the process by which individuals join new religious groups have even questioned the utility of the concept of conversion suggesting that affiliation is a more useful concept Popular culture Main article New religious movements and cults in popular culture Beginning in the 1700s authors in the Englishspeaking world began introducing members of cults as antagonists Satanists sects of the Mormon movement and Thuggees were popular choices In the Twentieth century concern for the rights and feelings of religious minorities led authors to most often invent fictional cults for their villains to be members of Fictional cults continue to be popular in film television and gaming in the same way while some popular works treat real cults and new religious movements in a serious manner Anticult movements Christian countercult movement Main article Christian countercult movement In the 1940s the long held opposition by some established Christian denominations to nonChristian religions andor supposedly heretical or counterfeit Christian sects crystallized into a more organized Christian countercult movement in the United States For those belonging to the movement all religious groups claiming to be Christian but deemed outside of Christian orthodoxy were considered cults Christian cults are new religious movements which have a Christian background but are considered to be theologically deviant by members of other Christian churches In his influential book The Kingdom of the Cults first published in the United States in 1965 Christian scholar Walter Martin defines Christian cults as groups that follow the personal interpretation of an individual rather than the understanding of the Bible accepted by mainstream Christianity He mentions The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints Christian Science Jehovahs Witnesses Unitarian Universalism and Unity as examples The Christian countercult movement asserts that Christian sects whose beliefs are partially or wholly not in accordance with the Bible are erroneous It also states that a religious sect can be considered a cult if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential Christian teachings such as salvation the Trinity Jesus himself as a person the ministry of Jesus the miracles of Jesus the Crucifixion the Resurrection of Christ the Second Coming of Christ and the Rapture Countercult literature usually expresses doctrinal or theological concerns and a missionary or apologetic purpose It presents a rebuttal by emphasizing the teachings of the Bible against the beliefs of nonfundamental Christian sects Christian countercult activist writers also emphasize the need for Christians to evangelize to followers of cults Secular anticult movement Main article Anticult movement In the early 1970s a secular opposition movement to groups considered cults had taken shape The organizations that formed the secular anticult movement ACM often acted on behalf of relatives of cult converts who did not believe their loved ones could have altered their lives so drastically by their own free will A few psychologists and sociologists working in this field suggested that brainwashing techniques were used to maintain the loyalty of cult members while others rejected the idea The belief that cults brainwashed their members became a unifying theme among cult critics and in the more extreme corners of the anticult movement techniques like the sometimes forceful deprogramming of cult members was practiced Secular cult opponents belonging to the anticult movement usually define a cult as a group that tends to manipulate exploit and control its members Specific factors in cult behavior are said to include manipulative and authoritarian mind control over members communal and totalistic organization aggressive proselytizing systematic programs of indoctrination and perpetuation in middleclass communities In the mass media and among average citizens cult gained an increasingly negative connotation becoming associated with things like kidnapping brainwashing psychological abuse sexual abuse and other criminal activity and mass suicide While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant however peaceful or law abiding it may be While some psychologists were receptive to these theories sociologists were for the most part sceptical of their ability to explain conversion to NRMs In the late 1980s psychologists and sociologists started to abandon theories like brainwashing and mindcontrol While scholars may believe that various less dramatic coercive psychological mechanisms could influence group members they came to see conversion to new religious movements principally as an act of a rational choice Reactions to the anticult movements Because of the increasingly pejorative use of the words cult and cult leader since the cult debate of the 1970s some academics in addition to groups referred to as cults argue that these are words to be avoided Catherine Wessinger Loyola University New Orleans has stated that the word cult represents just as much prejudice and antagonism as racial slurs or derogatory words for women and homosexuals She has argued that it is important for people to become aware of the bigotry conveyed by the word drawing attention to the way it dehumanises the groups members and their children Labeling a group as subhuman she says becomes a justification for violence against it She also says that labeling a group a cult makes people feel safe because the violence associated with religion is split off from conventional religions projected onto others and imagined to involve only aberrant groups This fails to take into account that child abuse sexual abuse financial extortion and warfare have also been committed by believers of mainstream religions but the pejorative cult stereotype makes it easier to avoid confronting this uncomfortable fact Sociologist Amy Ryan has argued for the need to differentiate those groups that may be dangerous from groups that are more benign Ryan notes the sharp differences between definition from cult opponents who tend to focus on negative characteristics and those of sociologists who aim to create definitions that are valuefree The movements themselves may have different definitions of religion as well George Chryssides also cites a need to develop better definitions to allow for common ground in the debate In Defining Religion in American Law Bruce J Casino presents the issue as crucial to international human rights laws Limiting the definition of religion may interfere with freedom of religion while too broad a definition may give some dangerous or abusive groups a limitless excuse for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations American Psychological Association rejection of brainwashing theory In 1983 Margaret Singer a leading anticultist who also had studied the political brainwashing of Korean prisoners of war was asked by the American Psychological Association APA to chair a taskforce called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control DIMPAC to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by cults Before the taskforce had submitted its final report the APA submitted on 10 February 1987 an amicus curiæ brief in an ongoing court case related to brainwashing Although the amicus curiæ brief written by the APA denies the credibility of the brainwashing theory the APA submitted the brief under intense pressure by a consortium of proreligion scholars aka NRM scholars The brief repudiated Singers theories on coercive persuasion and suggested that brainwashing theories were without empirical proof Afterward the APA filed a motion to withdraw its signature from the brief since Singers final report had not been completed On 11 May 1987 the APAs Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology BSERP rejected the DIMPAC report because the report lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur and concluded that after much consideration BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue Benjamin Zablocki and Alberto Amitrani interpreted the APAs response as meaning that there was no unanimous decision on the issue either way suggesting also that Singer retained the respect of the psychological community after the incident Two critical letters from external reviewers Benjamin BeitHallahmi and Jeffery D Fisher accompanied the rejection memo The letters criticized brainwashing as an unrecognized theoretical concept and Singers reasoning as so flawed that it was almost ridiculous After her findings were rejected Singer sued the APA in 1992 for defamation frauds aiding and abetting and conspiracy and lost After that time US courts consistently rejected testimonies about mind control and manipulation stating that such theories were not part of accepted mainline science according to the Frye Standard of 1923 Subcategories Destructive cults Destructive cult has generally referred to groups whose members have through deliberate action physically injured or killed other members of their own group or other people The Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance limit use of the term to specifically refer to religious groups that have caused or are liable to cause loss of life among their membership or the general public Psychologist Michael Langone executive director of the anticult group International Cultic Studies Association defines a destructive cult as a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically andor psychologically damages members and recruits John Gordon Clark cited totalitarian systems of governance and an emphasis on money making as characteristics of a destructive cult In Cults and the Family the authors cite Shapiro who defines a destructive cultism as a sociopathic syndrome whose distinctive qualities include behavioral and personality changes loss of personal identity cessation of scholastic activities estrangement from family disinterest in society and pronounced mental control and enslavement by cult leaders In the opinion of Benjamin Zablocki a Professor of Sociology at Rutgers University destructive cults are at high risk of becoming abusive to members He states that this is in part due to members adulation of charismatic leaders contributing to the leaders becoming corrupted by power According to Barrett the most common accusation made against destructive cults is sexual abuse According to Kranenborg some groups are risky when they advise their members not to use regular medical care Some researchers have criticized the usage of the term destructive cult writing that it is used to describe groups which are not necessarily harmful in nature to themselves or others In his book Understanding New Religious Movements John A Saliba writes that the term is overgeneralized Saliba sees the Peoples Temple as the paradigm of a destructive cult where those that use the term are implying that other groups will also commit mass suicide Writing in the book Misunderstanding Cults Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field contributor Julius H Rubin complains that the term has been used to discredit certain groups in the court of public opinion In his work Cults in Context author Lorne L Dawson writes that although the Unification Church has not been shown to be violent or volatile it has been described as a destructive cult by anticult crusaders In 2002 the German government was held by Germanys Federal Constitutional Court to have defamed the Osho movement by referring to it among other things as a destructive cult with no factual basis Doomsday cults Main article Doomsday cult Doomsday cult is an expression used to describe groups who believe in Apocalypticism and Millenarianism and can refer both to groups that predict disaster and to those that attempt to bring it about A 1997 psychological study by Festinger Riecken and Schachter found that people turned to a cataclysmic world view after they had repeatedly failed to find meaning in mainstream movements Leon Festinger and his colleagues had observed members of a small UFO religion called the Seekers for several months and recorded their conversations both prior to and after a failed prophecy from their charismatic leader Their work was later published in the book When Prophecy Fails A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World In the late 1980s doomsday cults were a major topic of news reports with some reporters and commentators considering them to be a serious threat to society Political cults A political cult is a cult with a primary interest in political action and ideology Groups that some writers have termed as political cults mostly advocating farleft or farright agendas have received some attention from journalists and scholars In their 2000 book On the Edge Political Cults Right and Left Dennis Tourish and Tim Wohlforth discuss about a dozen organizations in the United States and Great Britain that they characterize as cults In a separate article Tourish says that in his usage The word cult is not a term of abuse as this paper tries to explain It is nothing more than a shorthand expression for a particular set of practices that have been observed in a variety of dysfunctional organisations The LaRouche Movement and Gino Parentes National Labor Federation NATLFED are examples of political groups that have been described as cults based in the United States another is Marlene Dixons nowdefunct Democratic Workers Party a critical history of the DWP is given in Bounded Choice by Janja A Lalich a sociologist and former DWP member The followers of Ayn Rand were characterized as a cult by economist Murray N Rothbard during her lifetime and later by Michael Shermer The core group around Rand was called the Collective and is now defunct the chief group disseminating Rands ideas today is the Ayn Rand Institute Although the Collective advocated an individualist philosophy Rothbard claimed they were organized in the manner of a Leninist organization In Britain the Workers Revolutionary Party a Trotskyist group led by the late Gerry Healy and strongly supported by actress Vanessa Redgrave has been described by others who have been involved in the Trotskyist movement as having been a cult or as displaying cultlike characteristics in the 1970s and 1980s It is also described as such by Tourish and Wohlforth in their writings In his review of Tourish and Wohlforths book Bob Pitt a former member of the WRP concedes that it had a cultlike character but argues that rather than being typical of the far left this feature actually made the WRP atypical and led to its being treated as a pariah within the revolutionary left itself Workers Struggle LO Lutte ouvrière in France publicly headed by Arlette Laguiller but revealed in the 1990s to be directed by Robert Barcia has often been criticized as a cult for example by Daniel CohnBendit and his older brother Gabriel CohnBendit as well as LHumanité and Libération In his book Les Sectes Politiques 1965–1995 translation Political cults 1965–1995 French writer Cyril Le Tallec considered some religious groups as cults involved in politics including the League for Catholic CounterReformation the Cultural Office of Cluny New Acropolis Sōka Gakkai the Divine Light Mission Tradition Family Property TFP LongoMai the Supermen Club and the Association for Promotion of the Industrial Arts Solazaref In 1990 Lucy Patrick commented Although we live in a democracy cult behavior manifests itself in our unwillingness to question the judgment of our leaders our tendency to devalue outsiders and to avoid dissent We can overcome cult behavior he says by recognizing that we have dependency needs that are inappropriate for mature people by increasing antiauthoritarian education and by encouraging personal autonomy and the free exchange of ideas Polygamist cults Cults that teach and practice polygamy marriage between more than two people most often polygyny one man having multiple wives have long been noted although they are a minority It has been estimated that there are around 50000 members of polygamist cults in North America Often polygamist cults are viewed negatively by legal authorities and by society sometimes including related mainstream denominations because of perceived links to possible domestic abuse and child abuse In 1890 the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints Wilford Woodruff issued a public declaration the Manifesto announcing that the LDS Church had discontinued new plural marriages AntiMormon sentiment waned as did opposition to statehood for Utah The Smoot Hearings in 1904 which documented that the LDS Church was still practicing polygamy spurred the church to issue a Second Manifesto again claiming that it had ceased performing new plural marriages By 1910 the LDS Church excommunicated those who entered into or performed new plural marriages Enforcement of the 1890 Manifesto caused various splinter groups to leave the LDS Church in order to continue the practice of plural marriageThe Church of Jesus Christ Restored is a small sect in the Latter Day Saint movement based at Chatsworth Ontario Canada It has been referred to in the news media as a polygamous cult and has been the subject of criminal investigation by local authorities Racist cults Sociologist and historian Orlando Patterson has described the Ku Klux Klan which arose in the American South after the Civil War as a heretical Christian cult and their persecution of African Americans and others as a form of human sacrifice Secret Aryan cults in Germany and Austria in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had a strong influence on the rise of Nazism Modern Skinhead groups in the United States tend to use the same recruitment techniques as destructive cults Terrorist cults In the book Jihad and Sacred Vengeance Psychological Undercurrents of History psychiatrist Peter A Olsson compares Osama bin Laden to certain cult leaders including Jim Jones David Koresh Shoko Asahara Marshall Applewhite Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro and says that each of these individuals fit at least eight of the nine criteria for narcissistic personality disorder In the book Seeking the Compassionate Life The Moral Crisis for Psychotherapy and Society authors Goldberg and Crespo also refer to Osama bin Laden as a destructive cult leader At a 2002 meeting of the American Psychological Association APA anticultist Steven Hassan said that Al Qaida fulfills the characteristics of a destructive cult He added We need to apply what we know about destructive mindcontrol cults and this should be a priority with the war on terrorism We need to understand the psychological aspects of how people are recruited and indoctrinated so we can slow down recruitment We need to help counsel former cult members and possibly use some of them in the war against terrorism In an article on AlQaida published in The Times journalist Mary Ann Sieghart wrote that alQaida resembles a classic cult commenting AlQaida fits all the official definitions of a cult It indoctrinates its members it forms a closed totalitarian society it has a selfappointed messianic and charismatic leader and it believes that the ends justify the means The Shining Path guerrilla movement active in Peru in the 1980s and 1990s has been described variously as a cult and an intense cult of personality The Tamil Tigers have also been qualified as such by French magazine LExpress The Peoples Mujahedin of Iran a leftist guerrilla movement based in Iraq has been controversially described as a political cult and as a movement that is abusive towards its own members Former Mujaheddin member and now author and academic Dr Masoud Banisadr stated in a May 2005 speech in Spain If you ask me are all cults a terrorist organisation My answer is no as there are many peaceful cults at present around the world and in the history of mankind But if you ask me are all terrorist organisations some sort of cult my answer is yes Even if they start as an ordinary modern political party or organisation to prepare and force their members to act without asking any moral questions and act selflessly for the cause of the group and ignore all the ethical cultural moral or religious codes of the society and humanity those organisations have to change into a cult Therefore to understand an extremist or a terrorist organisation one has to learn about a cult In 2003 the group ordered some of its members to set themselves on fire two of whom died Regional developments The application of the labels cult or sect to religious movements in government documents signifies the popular and negative use of the term cult in English and a functionally similar use of words translated as sect in several European languages Sociologists critical to this negative politicized use of the word cult argue that it may adversely impact the religious freedoms of group members At the height of the countercult movement and ritual abuse scare of the 1990s some governments published lists of cults While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe the groups Since the 2000s some governments have again distanced themselves from such classifications of religious movements While the official response to new religious groups has been mixed across the globe some governments aligned more with the critics of these groups to the extent of distinguishing between legitimate religion and dangerous unwanted cults in public policy China For centuries governments in China have categorized certain religions as xiejiao Chinese 邪教 pinyin xiéjiào – sometimes translated as evil cult or as heterodox teaching In imperial China the classification of a religion as xiejiao did not necessarily mean that a religion’s teachings were believed to be false or inauthentic but rather the label was applied to religious groups that were not authorized by the state or that were seen as challenging the legitimacy of the state In modern China the term xiejiao continues to be used to denote teachings that the government disapproves of and these groups face suppression and punishment by authorities Fourteen different groups in China have been listed by the ministry of public security as xiejiao In addition in 1999 Chinese authorities denounced the Falun Gong spiritual practice as a heretical teaching and began a campaign to eliminate it According to Amnesty International the persecution of Falun Gong includes a multifaceted propaganda campaign a program of enforced ideological conversion and reeducation as well as a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests forced labour and physical torture sometimes resulting in death Russia In 2008 the Russian Interior Ministry prepared a list of extremist groups At the top of the list were Islamic groups outside of traditional Islam which is supervised by the Russian government Next listed were Pagan cults In 2009 the Russian Ministry of Justice created a council which it named Council of Experts Conducting State Religious Studies Expert Analysis The new council listed 80 large sects which it considered potentially dangerous to Russian society and mentioned that there were thousands of smaller ones Large sects listed included The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints Jehovahs Witnesses and what were called neoPentecostals United States In the 1970s the scientific status of the brainwashing theory became a central topic in US court cases where the theory was used to try to justify the use of the forceful deprogramming of cult members Meanwhile sociologists critical of these theories assisted advocates of religious freedom in defending the legitimacy of new religious movements in court In the United States religious activities of cults are protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution which prohibits governmental establishment of religion and protects freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of the press and freedom of assembly However no religious or cult members are granted any special immunity from criminal charges Western Europe France and Belgium have taken policy positions which accept brainwashing theories uncritically while other European nations like Sweden and Italy are cautious about brainwashing and have adopted more neutral responses to new religions Scholars have suggested that outrage following the mass murdersuicides perpetuated by the Solar Temple as well as the more latent xenophobic and antiAmerican attitudes have contributed significantly to European anticult positions In the 1980s clergymen and officials of the French government expressed concern that some orders and other groups within the Roman Catholic Church would be adversely affected by anticult laws then being considered See also Anticult movement GrecoRoman mysteries List of
