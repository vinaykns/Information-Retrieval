This was the site of the BBC show Top Gear the runway is now a racetrack or a test track History Construction and military use Canadian engineers were charged with the construction of the aerodrome Such projects had previously taken up to a year to complete and this site was complicated by the two hundred acres of woodland that first had to be cleared The Canadian sappers had access to largescale earth moving equipment from North America obtained under LendLease arrangements The Canadians also had pipepushing apparatus place explosives under trees thereby facilitating their rapid removal The aerodrome was completed in just six months The first squadrons based at the aerodrome were 400 414 and 430 Squadrons RCAF equipped with Curtiss Tomahawks and North American Mustangs They were followed by the North American Mitchell Mk II medium bombers of No 139 Wing RAF consisting of 98 and 180 Squadrons RAF and 320 Squadron formed from Dutch Naval Aviation Service personnel When 139 Wing departed for the continent in the autumn of 1944 83 Group Support Unit later 83 Group Disbandment Centre arrived with Spitfires Typhoons and Tempests After the war the airfield was used by the RAF to repatriate prisonersofwar Dunsfold was declared inactive by the RAF in 1946 but was then used by Skyways Ltd with York Lancastrian Skymaster Rapide and Dove aircraft Skyways operations included support of the Berlin Airlift Skyways also refurbished exRAF Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes for the Portuguese Air Force Postwar use In 1950 The Hawker Aircraft Company acquired the lease of the site Dunsfold became internationally known for development of the Hunter jet fighter limited numbers of Sea Hawks were also produced and Sea Furies were refurbished Airwork Ltd leased two hangars from 195358 for the refurbishment of North American F86 Sabres and Supermarine Attackers In October 1960 the then Hawker Siddeley flight tested its Hawker P1127 prototype the development aircraft that led to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier the first VTOL jet fighter bomber Folland Gnat test flying and production moved to Dunsfold from Chilbolton Hampshire in 1961 Final assembly of the Harrier and the Hawk trainer aircraft was at Dunsfold Hawker Siddeley became part of British Aerospace in 1977 On 2 July 1986 British Aerospaces deputy chief test pilot Jim Hawkins was killed at Dunsfold when his developmental Hawk 200 crashed On 24 June 1999 British Aerospace announced the closure of Dunsfold as part of a restructuring Hawk final assembly had been transferred to Warton in 1988 the BAe Sea Harrier production finished in 1998 and the Harrier 2 production was moved to Brough in 2000 The gate guardian aircraft – Hawker P1127 XP984 – was moved to Brooklands Museum on longterm loan Present day In 2002 BAE Systems British Aerospaces successor sold Dunsfold Aerodrome to The Rutland Group who formed Dunsfold Park Ltd Today the BBC motoring show Top Gear was recorded at the park using a hangar as a studio and parts of the runways and taxiways of the aerodrome as their test track Some of the track is now used by many driving schools and instructors to enable under 17yearolds to learn to drive Hundreds of youngsters have now had their first driving experience at the Top Gear location before going out on to the road The track is also used to host cycle races in the summer months as part of a closed circuit series in the Surrey Cycle Racing League Dunsfold Park is also home to Wings and Wheels an annual air and motor show that is typically held in late August The airshow attracted over 25000 visitors and raised over £80000 for charities including Help for Heroes and the Surrey Sussex Air Ambulance in 2009 Increasing popularity has meant the event is now a twoday show Dunsfold Park Ltd also organises a drivein cinema Dunsfold DriveIn 1 over the Easter bank holiday as well as a popular and classical concert Strings Wings 2 Future In 2006 the owners of Dunsfold Aerodrome proposed the construction of a new settlement with 2600 homes on the site a school health services public transport and road links to the A281 and an expanded business district The project was designed to be an exemplar of green and sustainable living In late 2007 Dunsfold Park Ltd applied to have their plans for the new town selected as one of the then Labour governments proposed ecotowns On 3 April 2008 Dunsfold Park was one of over 40 proposals denied ecotown status by the then housing minister Caroline Flint The governments summary assessment said that the bid was too small in terms of house numbers because the proposal at Dunsfold was for only 2600 houses whereas the minimum size for an ecotown was 5000 The assessment also said that the public transport offering needed further work In May 2008 Dunsfold Park Limited applied to Waverley Borough Council for planning consent for the ecosettlement It was opposed by local residents Surrey County Council four borough councils and 13 parish councils as well as the South East England Regional Assembly and the South East England Development Agency It received support from Age Concern Waverley Guildford Labour Party Farnham Labour Party Cranleigh Labour Party and the former Lib Dem MP for Guildford Sue Doughty It also received support from some environmentalists including leading national authorities on sustainable living such as Professor Roland Clift and from national Friends of the Earth for its innovative approach and contribution to sustainable development Friends of the Earth also supported the development on the basis that redevelopment as an ecosettlement would remove the threat of aviation expansion at Dunsfold once and for all However the proposal was refused planning permission by the local borough council Waverley and in 2009 rejected on appeal by the then secretary of state John Denham Although the owners say they still hope to persuade the authorities that ecosettlement remains the best longterm future for the site they say they are now concentrating on expanding and promoting the underlying aviation potential of the aerodrome which is still in operational use Dunsfold Parks existing lawful use is in part as an aerodrome under a series of temporary planning consents which contain restrictions on the levels of aircraft movement and restrict flying to certain times However the longterm and permanent underlying use has been a matter of considerable dispute between the owners and the council In April 2011 Dunsfold Park claimed that the use of the site for aviation was entirely unrestricted on the grounds that the use predated the introduction of the planning acts or alternatively that a 60yearold planning consent dating from 1951 allowed the unrestricted use of the aerodrome for aviation The claim led to objections from parties such as all the local parish councils and bodies such as the Council to Protect Rural England and Friends of the Earth and concern was expressed by local MPs In June 2011 Waverley Borough Council refused Dunsfold Park Ltds application for a certificate of lawful use as an aerodrome Dunsfold appealed but the appeal was rejected in April 2012 When rejecting the appeal the inspector made reference to the old planning consent granted in 1951 for erection repair and flight testing of aircraft stating that it was now agreed by all parties that it was and is a permanent permission and that the use at Dunsfold will revert to the 1951 consent in 2018 on expiry of the existing temporary consents In April 2014 Lord Justice Sullivan at the High Court said the 1951 permission for flight testing did not amount to consent for unrestricted flying Memorial A memorial funded by public subscription was erected outside the nearby Alfold Barn pub on the A281 road between Guildford and Horsham with the permission of Alfold Parish Council Dunsfold Parish Council declined to host the memorial The memorial and its unveiling on 20 July
