named Think Tank of the Year Brookings states that its staff represent diverse points of view and describes itself as nonpartisan while the media sometimes describes Brookings as liberal An academic analysis of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referenced by conservative politicians almost as frequently as liberal politicians earning a score of 53 on a 1–100 scale with 100 representing the most liberal score The same study found Brookings to be the most frequently cited think tank by the US media and politicians Political stance As a 501c3 nonprofit organization Brookings describes itself as independent and nonpartisan A 2005 academic study by UCLA concluded it was centrist in that it was referenced as an authority almost equally by both conservative and liberal politicians in congressional records from 1993 to 2002 The New York Times has referred to the organization as liberal liberalcentrist centrist and conservative The Washington Post has described Brookings as centrist and liberal The Los Angeles Times has described Brookings as liberalleaning and centrist before opining that it did not believe such labels mattered In 1977 Time Magazine described it as the nations preeminent liberal think tank Newsweek has described Brookings as centrist while Politico has used the term centerleft The leftwing media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting describes it as conservative Some liberals argue however that despite its leftofcenter reputation Brookings foreign policy scholars were overly supportive of Bush administration policies abroad Matthew Yglesias a liberal blogger has pointed out that Brookingss Michael E OHanlon frequently agrees with scholars from conservative organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute The Weekly Standard and the Project for a New American Century Similarly Brookings fellow and research director Benjamin Wittes is a member of the conservative Hoover Institutions Task Force on National Security and Law Brookings scholars have served in Republican and Democratic administrations including Mark McClellan Ron Haskins and Martin Indyk The Brookings Board of

was founded in 1916 as the Institute for Government Research IGR with the mission of becoming the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level The Institutions founder philanthropist Robert S Brookings 1850–1932 originally financed the formation of three organizations the Institute for Government Research the Institute of Economics and the Robert Brookings Graduate School affiliated with Washington University in St Louis The three were merged into the Brookings Institution on December 8 1927 During the Great Depression economists at Brookings embarked on a large scale study commissioned by President Franklin D Roosevelt to understand the underlying causes of the depression Brookingss first president Harold Moulton and other Brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose President Roosevelts New Deal policies because they thought such measures were impeding economic recovery With the entry into World War II in 1941 Brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization In 1948 Brookings was asked to submit a plan for the administration of the European Recovery Program The resulting organization scheme assured that the Marshall Plan was run carefully and on a businesslike basis In 1952 Robert Calkins succeeded Moulton as president of the Brookings Institution He secured grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation that put the Institution on a strong financial basis He reorganized the Institution around the Economic Studies Government Studies and Foreign Policy Programs In 1957 the Institution moved from Jackson Avenue to a new research center near Dupont Circle in Washington DC Kermit Gordon assumed the presidency of Brookings in 1967 He began a series of studies of program choices for the federal budget in 1969 entitled Setting National Priorities He also expanded the Foreign Policy Studies Program to include research in national security and defense After the election of Richard Nixon to the presidency in 1968 the relationship between the Brookings Institution and the White House deteriorated at one point Nixons aide Charles Colson proposed a firebombing of the Institution Yet throughout the 1970s Brookings was offered more federal research contracts than it could handle 1980–2015 By the 1980s the Institution faced an increasingly competitive and ideologically charged intellectual environment The need to reduce the federal budget deficit became a major research theme as well as investigating problems with national security and government inefficiency Bruce MacLaury fourth president of Brookings also established the Center for Public Policy Education to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs In 1995 Michael Armacost became the fifth president of the Brookings Institution and led an effort to refocus the Institutions mission heading into the 21st century Under Armacosts direction Brookings created several interdisciplinary research centers such as the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy now the Metropolitan Policy Program led by Bruce J Katz brought attention to the strengths of cities and metropolitan areas and the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies which brings together specialists from different Asian countries to examine regional problems Strobe Talbott became president of Brookings in 2002 Shortly thereafter Brookings launched the Saban Center for Middle East Policy and the John L Thornton China Center In October 2006 Brookings announced the establishment of the BrookingsTsinghua Center in Beijing In July 2007 the Institution announced the creation of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform to be directed by senior fellow Mark McClellan and then in October 2007 the creation of the Brookings Doha Center directed by fellow Hady Amr in Qatar In 2015 Brookings found itself at the center of controversy over the fiduciary obligation of brokers to savers A nonresident senior fellow Robert Litan presented a study to Congress in July 2015 that contained a costbenefit analysis regarding a new agency rule He resigned that position as a result of a firestorm months later in September 2015 kicked up by Senator Elizabeth Warren DMA charging Litan — who had testified against a fiduciary obligation rule Litan was unaware of the brand new rule when he presented and settled with the Brookings Institute immediately after the presentation when they brought it to his attention Litans defenders continue to point out that he did disclose and that Warrens real motive was to silence a reasonable concern over the costbenefit balance Publications Brookings as an institution

encourage support for policies aligned with those foreign governments agenda The New York Times published documents showing that Brookings Institution accepted grants from Norway with specific policy requests and helped the country gain access to US government officials as well as other deliverables In June 2014 Norway agreed to make an additional 4 million donation to Brookings Several legal specialists who examined the documents between the Norway government and Brookings at The Times request told the paper that the language of the transactions appeared to necessitate Brookings filing as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agent Registration Act The Qatari government was named by The New York Times as the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings having reportedly made a 148 million fouryear contribution in 2013 A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers Brookings officials denied any connection between the views of their funders and their scholars work citing reports that questioned the Qatari governments education reform efforts and criticized its support of militants in Syria However Brookings officials reportedly acknowledged that they meet with Qatari government officials regularly to discuss the centers activities
