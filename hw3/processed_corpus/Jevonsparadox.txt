 In economics the Jevons paradox ˈdʒɛvənz sometimes the Jevons effect occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used reducing the amount necessary for any one use but the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics However governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising In 1865 the English economist William Stanley Jevons observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coaluse led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries He argued that contrary to common intuition technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption The issue has been reexamined by modern economists studying consumption rebound effects from improved energy efficiency In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource which increases the quantity demanded This counteracts to some extent the reduction in use from improved efficiency Additionally improved efficiency accelerates economic growth further increasing the demand for resources The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates and better efficiency leads to more resources being used Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation Some dismiss the paradox while others worry that it may be selfdefeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same or higher to avoid the Jevons paradox Conservation policies such as cap and trade do not display the paradox and can be used to control the rebound effect History The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book The Coal Question Jevons observed that Englands consumption of coal soared after James Watt introduced the Watt steam engine which greatly improved the efficiency of the coalfired steam engine from Thomas Newcomens earlier design Watts innovations made coal a more costeffective power source leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries This in turn increased total coal consumption even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase rather than decrease fuel use writing It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption The very contrary is the truth At that time many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption Jevons argued that this view was incorrect as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal Hence improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which Englands coal deposits were being depleted and could not be relied upon to solve the problem Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource including for example water usage It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics Cause Main article Rebound effect conservation Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient causing a rebound in the demand for fuel An increase in the efficiency with which a resource eg fuel is used causes a decrease in the cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve eg travel Generally speaking a decrease in the cost or price of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded the law of demand With a lower cost for travel consumers will travel more increasing the demand for fuel This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100 exceeding the original efficiency gains The size of the rebound effect is determined by the price elasticity of demand for the good In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled the effective price of travel would be halved twice as much travel can be purchased If in response the amount of travel purchased more than doubles ie demand is price elastic then fuel consumption would increase and the Jevons paradox would occur If demand is price inelastic the amount of travel purchased would less than double and fuel consumption would decrease However goods and services generally use more than one type of input eg fuel labour machinery and other factors besides input cost may also affect price These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur Khazzoom–Brookes postulate Main article Khazzoom–Brookes postulate In the 1980s economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of societys energy use Brookes then chief economist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission In 1992 the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in energy efficiency work to increase rather than decrease energy consumption the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation technological progress and longrun economic growth Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under a wide range of assumptions According to Saunders increased energy efficiency tends to increase energy consumption by two means First increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper thus encouraging increased use the direct rebound effect Second increased energy efficiency leads to increased economic growth which pulls up energy use for the whole economy At the microeconomic level looking at an individual market even with the rebound effect improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption That is the rebound effect is usually less than 100 However at the macroeconomic level more efficient and hence comparatively cheaper energy leads to faster economic growth which increases energy use throughout the economy Saunders argued that taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use Energy conservation policy Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use But this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life For example a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution However if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct increased fuel efficiency by itself will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels There is considerable debate about whether the KhazzoomBrookes Postulate is correct and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy Most governments environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems Others including many environmental economists doubt this efficiency strategy towards sustainability and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption They hold that for resource use to fall efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that energy conservation efforts are futile for example that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency eg if cars are more efficient it will simply lead to more driving Several points have been raised against this argument First in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries the direct rebound effect is usually small and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use other conditions remaining constant Second even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency For example increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil Third environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention eg a fuel tax that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use and that sustainable energy policy must rely on other types of government interventions As the Jevons paradox applies only to technological improvements that increase fuel efficiency the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase costs do not display the paradox and can be used to control the rebound effect To ensure that efficiencyenhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand eg green taxes cap and trade or higher emissions standards The ecological economists Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities efficiencyimproving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable and more likely to be implemented Jevonss Complementary Corollary Noted economist Edward Glaeser has proposed what he calls Jevonss sic
