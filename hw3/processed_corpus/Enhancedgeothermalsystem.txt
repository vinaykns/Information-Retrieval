 An enhanced geothermal system EGS generates geothermal electricity without the need for natural convective hydrothermal resources Until recently geothermal power systems have exploited only resources where naturally occurring heat water and rock permeability are sufficient to allow energy extraction However by far most of geothermal energy within reach of conventional techniques is in dry and impermeable rock EGS technologies enhance andor create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock HDR through hydraulic stimulation When natural cracks and pores do not allow economic flow rates the permeability can be enhanced by pumping highpressure cold water down an injection well into the rock The injection increases the fluid pressure in the naturally fractured rock triggering shear events that enhance the systems permeability As long as the injection pressure is maintained a high matrix permeability is not required nor are hydraulic fracturing proppants required to maintain the fractures in an open state This process is termed hydroshearing perhaps to differentiate it from hydraulic tensile fracturing used in the oil and gas industry which can create new fractures through the rock in addition to expanding the existing fractures Water travels through fractures in the rock capturing the rocks heat until forced out of a second borehole as very hot water The waters heat is converted into electricity using either a steam turbine or a binary power plant system All of the water now cooled is injected back into the ground to heat up again in a closed loop EGS technologies can function as baseload resources that produce power 24 hours a day Unlike hydrothermal EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the economic limits of drill depth Good locations are over deep granite covered by a 3–5 kilometres 19–31 mi layer of insulating sediments that slow heat loss An EGS plant is expected to have an economical lifetime of 2030 years using current technology EGS systems are currently being developed and tested in France Australia Japan Germany the US and Switzerland The largest EGS project in the world is a 25megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in Cooper Basin Australia Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5000–10000 MW Research and development Australia The Australian government has provided research funding for the development of Hot Dry Rock technology On 30 May 2007 then Australian opposition environmental spokesperson and former Minister for the Environment Heritage and the Arts Peter Garrett announced that if elected at the 2007 Australian Federal Election the Australian Labor Party would use taxpayer money to subsidise putting the necessary drilling rigs in place In an interview he promised There are some technical difficulties and challenges there but those people who are keen on getting Australia into geothermal say weve got this great access to resource and one of the things interestingly thats held them back is not having the capacity to put the drilling plants in place And so what we intend this 50 million to go towards is to provide oneforone dollars Match 1 from us 1 from the industry so that they can get these drilling rigs on to site and really get the best sites identified and get the industry going European Union The EUs EGS RD project at SoultzsousForêts France has recently connected its 15 MW demonstration plant to the grid The Soultz project has explored the connection of multiple stimulated zones and the performance of triplet well configurations 1 injector2 producers Induced seismicity in Basel led to the cancellation of the EGS project there The Portuguese government awarded in December 2008 an exclusive license to Geovita Ltd to prospect and explore geothermal energy in one of the best areas in continental Portugal An area of about 500 square kilometers is being studied by Geovita together with the Earth Sciences department of the University of Coimbras Science and Technology faculty and the installation of an Enhanced Geothermal System EGS is foreseen United Kingdom Cornwall is set to host a 3MW demonstration project based at the Eden Project that could pave the way for a series of 50MW commercialscale geothermal power stations in suitable areas across the country A commercialscale project near Redruth is also planned The plant which has been granted planning permission would generate 10 MW of electricity and 55 MW of thermal energy and is scheduled to become operational in 2013–2014 United States Early days — Fenton Hill Main article Hot dry rock geothermal energy The first EGS effort — then termed Hot Dry Rock — took place at Fenton Hill New Mexico with a project run by the federal Los Alamos Laboratory It was the first attempt to make a deep fullscale EGS reservoir The EGS reservoir at Fenton Hill was first completed in 1977 at a depth of about 26 km with rock temperatures of 185 C In 1979 the reservoir was enlarged with additional hydraulic stimulation and was operated for about 1 year The results demonstrated that heat could be extracted at reasonable rates from a hydraulically stimulated region of lowpermeability hot crystalline rock In 1986 a second reservoir was prepared for initial hydraulic circulation and heat extraction testing In a 30day flow test with a constant reinjection temperature of 20 C the production temperature steadily increased to about 190 C corresponding to a thermal power level of about 10 MW Due to budget cuts further study at Fenton Hill was discontinued Working at the edges—using EGS technology to improve hydrothermal resources EGS funding languished for the next few years and by the next decade US efforts focused on the less ambitious goal of improving the productivity of existing hydrothermal resources According to the fiscal year 2004 Budget Request to Congress from DOEs Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy EGS are engineered reservoirs that have been created to extract heat from economically unproductive geothermal resources EGS technology includes those methods and equipment that enhance the removal of energy from a resource by increasing the productivity of the reservoir Better productivity may result from improving the reservoir’s natural permeability andor providing additional fluids to transport heat In fiscal year 2002 preliminary designs for five projects employing EGS technology were completed and the Coso Hot Springs geothermal field at the US Naval Weapons Air Station in China Lake California was selected for fullscale development Two additional projects were selected for preliminary analysis at Desert Peak in Nevada and Glass Mountain in California Funding for this effort totaled 15 million The effort was continued in 2003 with an additional 35 million In 2009 The US Department of Energy USDOE issued two Funding Opportunity Announcements FOAs related to enhanced geothermal systems Together the two FOAs offered up to 84 million over six years The DOE followed up with another FOA in 2009 of stimulus funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act for 350 million including 80 million aimed specifically at EGS projects FORGE In February 2014 the Department of Energy announced the intent to establish a dedicated subsurface laboratory called the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy FORGE in order to investigate and develop enhanced geothermal technology In August 2016 it was announced that the proposed sites had been narrowed to two in Utah and Nevada expected to be reduced to one the following year Beginning in 2018 the selected site will host the FORGE laboratory which will provide annual solicitations for research to be performed there Induced seismicity Main article Induced seismicity Some induced seismicity is inevitable and expected in EGS which involves pumping fluids at pressure to enhance or create permeability through the use of hydroshearing and hydraulic fracturing techniques Hydroshear stimulation methods seek to expand and extend the connectivity of the rocks existing fractures to create a better fluid network for the transfer of heat from the rock to the fluid Seismicity events at the Geysers geothermal field in California have been strongly correlated with injection data The case of induced seismicity in Basel merits special mention it led the city which is a partner to suspend the project and conduct a seismic hazard evaluation which resulted in the cancellation of the project in December 2009 According to the Australian government risks associated with hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring and should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the Hot Rock geothermal energy resource However the risks of induced seismicity vary from site to site and should be considered before large scale fluid injection is begun CO2 EGS The Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence at the University of Queensland has been awarded AUD 183 million for EGS research a large portion of which will be used to develop CO2 EGS technologies Research conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratories and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories examined the use of supercritical CO2 instead of water as the geothermal working fluid with favorable results CO2 has numerous advantages for EGS CO2 is however much more expensive and somewhat more difficult to work with than water EGS potential in the United States A 2006 report by MIT and funded by the US Department of Energy conducted the most comprehensive analysis to date on the potential and technical status of EGS The 18member panel chaired by Professor Jefferson Tester of MIT reached several significant conclusions Resource size The report calculated the United States total EGS resources from 3–10 km of depth to be over 13000 zettajoules of which over 200 ZJ would be extractable with the potential to increase this to over 2000 ZJ with technology improvements — sufficient to provide all the worlds current energy needs for several millennia The report found that total geothermal resources including hydrothermal and geopressured resources to equal 14000 ZJ — or roughly 140000 times the total US annual primary energy use in 2005 Development potential With an RD investment of 1 billion over 15 years the report estimated that 100 GWe gigawatts of electricity or more could be installed by 2050 in the United States The report further found that recoverable resources accessible with todays technology were between 12–122 TW for the conservative and moderate recovery scenarios respectively Cost The report found that EGS could be capable of producing electricity for as low as 39 centskWh EGS costs were found to be sensitive to four main factors Temperature of the resource Fluid flow through the system measured in literssecond Drilling costs Power
