 Synthetic fuel or synfuel is a liquid fuel or sometimes gaseous fuel obtained from syngas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in which the syngas was derived from gasification of solid feedstocks such as coal or biomass or by reforming of natural gas Common methods for manufacturing synthetic fuels include the Fischer Tropsch conversion methanol to gasoline conversion or direct coal liquefaction As of July 2009 worldwide commercial synthetic fuels production capacity was over 240000 barrels per day 38000 md with numerous new projects in construction or development Classification and principles The term synthetic fuel has several different meanings and it may include different types of fuels More traditional definitions eg definition given by the International Energy Agency define synthetic fuel as any liquid fuel obtained from coal or natural gas The Energy Information Administration defines synthetic fuels in its Annual Energy Outlook 2006 as fuels produced from coal natural gas or biomass feedstocks through chemical conversion into synthetic crude andor synthetic liquid products A number of synthetic fuels definitions include fuels produced from biomass and industrial and municipal waste The definition of synthetic fuel also allows oil sands and oil shale as synthetic fuel sources and in addition to liquid fuels synthesized gaseous fuels are also considered to be synthetic fuels in his Synthetic fuels handbook petrochemist James G Speight included liquid and gaseous fuels as well as clean solid fuels produced by conversion of coal oil shale or tar sands and various forms of biomass although he admits that in the context of substitutes for petroleumbased fuels it has even wider meaning Depending on the context methanol ethanol and hydrogen may also be included Synthetic fuels are produced by the chemical process of conversion Conversion methods could be direct conversion into liquid transportation fuels or indirect conversion in which the source substance is converted initially into syngas which then goes through additional conversion process to become liquid fuels Basic conversion methods include carbonization and pyrolysis hydrogenation and thermal dissolution History See also Oil Campaign of World War II and Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program Direct conversion of coal to synthetic fuel was originally developed in Germany The Bergius process was developed by Friedrich Bergius yielding a patent in 1913 Karl Goldschmidt invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the Th Goldschmidt AG now known as Evonik Industries in 1914 Production began in 1919 Indirect coal conversion where coal is gasified and then converted to synthetic fuels was also developed in Germany by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in 1923 During World War II Germany used synthetic oil manufacturing German Kohleverflüssigung to produce substitute Ersatz oil products by using the Bergius process from coal the Fischer–Tropsch process water gas and other methods Zeitz used the TTH and MTH processes In 1931 the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research located in Greenwich England set up a small facility where hydrogen gas was combined with coal at extremely high pressures to make a synthetic fuel The Bergius process plants were Nazi Germanys primary source of highgrade aviation gasoline synthetic oil synthetic rubber synthetic methanol synthetic ammonia and nitric acid Nearly one third of the Bergius production was produced by plants in Pölitz Polish Police and Leuna with 13 more in five other plants Ludwigshafen had a much smaller Bergius plant which improved gasoline quality by dehydrogenation using the DHD process Synthetic fuel grades included TL jet fuel first quality aviation gasoline aviation base gasoline and gasoline middle oil and producer gas and diesel were synthesized for fuel as well eg converted armored tanks used producer gas By early 1944 German synthetic fuel production had reached more than 124000 barrels per day 19700 md from 25 plants including 10 in the Ruhr Area In 1937 the four central Germany lignite coal plants at Böhlen Leuna MagdeburgRothensee and Zeitz along with the Ruhr Area bituminous coal plant at ScholvenBuer had produced 48 million barrels 760×10 m of fuel Four new hydrogenation plants German Hydrierwerke were subsequently erected at BottropWelheim which used Bituminous coal tar pitch Gelsenkirchen Nordstern Pölitz and at 200000 tonsyr Wesseling Nordstern and PölitzStettin used bituminous coal as did the new Blechhammer plants Heydebreck synthesized food oil which was tested on concentration camp prisoners The Geilenberg Special Staff was using 350000 mostly foreign forced laborers to reconstruct the bombed synthetic oil plants and in an emergency decentralization program to build 7 underground hydrogenation plants for bombing protection none were completed Planners had rejected an earlier such proposal because the war was to be won before the bunkers would be completed In July 1944 the Cuckoo project underground synthetic oil plant 800000 m was being carved out of the Himmelsburg North of the Mittelwerk but the plant was unfinished at the end of WWII Indirect FischerTropsch FT technologies were brought to the US after World War 2 and a 7000 barrels per day 1100 md plant was designed by HRI and built in Brownsville Texas The plant represented the first commercial use of hightemperature Fischer Tropsch conversion It operated from 1950 to 1955 when it was shut down when the price of oil dropped due to enhanced production and huge discoveries in the Middle East In 1949 a demonstration plant for converting coal to gasoline was built and operated by the US Bureau of Mines in Louisiana Missouri Direct coal conversion plants were also developed in the US after World War II including a 3 TPD plant in Lawrenceville New Jersey and a 250600 TPD Plant in Catlettsburg Kentucky In later decades the Republic of South Africa established a state oil company including a large synthetic fuel establishment Processes There are numerous processes that can be used to produce synthetic fuels These broadly fall into three categories Indirect Direct and Biofuel processes Indirect conversion Indirect conversion has the widest deployment worldwide with global production totaling around 260000 barrels per day 41000 md and many additional projects under active development Indirect conversion broadly refers to a process in which biomass coal or natural gas is converted to a mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide known as syngas either through gasification or steam methane reforming and that syngas is processed into a liquid transportation fuel using one of a number of different conversion techniques depending on the desired end product The primary technologies that produce synthetic fuel from syngas are FischerTropsch synthesis and the Mobil process also known as Methanol To Gasoline or MTG There are some technologies under development to produce ethanol from syngas though these have not yet been demonstrated at commercial scale The FischerTropsch process reacts syngas with typically a cobalt or ironbased catalyst and transforms the gas into liquid products primarily diesel fuel and jet fuel and potentially waxes depending on the FT process employed The process of producing synfuels through indirect conversion is often referred to as coaltoliquids CTL gastoliquids GTL or biomasstoliquids BTL depending on the initial feedstock At least three projects Ohio River Clean Fuels Illinois Clean Fuels and Rentech Natchez are combining coal and biomass feedstocks creating hybridfeedstock synthetic fuels known as Coal and Biomass To Liquids CBTL Indirect conversion process technologies can also be used to produce hydrogen potentially for use in fuel cell vehicles either as slipstream coproduct or as a primary output Direct conversion Direct conversion refers to processes in which coal or biomass feedstocks are converted directly into intermediate or final products without going through the intermediate step of conversion to syngas via gasification Direct conversion processes can be broadly broken up into two different methods Pyrolysis and carbonization and hydrogenation Hydrogenation processes See also Bergius process One of the main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the Bergius process In this process coal is liquefied by mixing it with hydrogen gas and heating the system hydrogenation Dry coal is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process Catalyst is typically added to the mixture The reaction occurs at between 400 °C 752 °F to 500 °C 932 °F and 20 to 70 MPa hydrogen pressure The reaction can be summarized as follows n C n 1 H 2 → C n H 2 n 2 displaystyle nrm Cn1rm H2rightarrow rm Cnrm H2n2 After World War I several plants were built in Germany these plants were extensively used during World War II to supply Germany with fuel and lubricants The Kohleoel Process developed in Germany by Ruhrkohle and VEBA was used in the demonstration plant with the capacity of 200 ton of lignite per day built in Bottrop Germany This plant operated from 1981 to 1987 In this process coal is mixed with a recycle solvent and iron catalyst After preheating and pressurizing H2 is added The process takes place in tubular reactor at the pressure of 300 bar and at the temperature of 470 °C 880 °F This process was also explored by SASOL in South Africa In 19701980s Japanese companies Nippon Kokan Sumitomo Metal Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries developed the NEDOL process In this process coal is mixed with a recycled solvent and a synthetic ironbased catalyst after preheating H2 is added The reaction takes place in tubular reactor at temperature between 430 °C 810 °F and 465 °C 870 °F at the pressure 150200 bar The produced oil has low quality and requires intensive upgrading HCoal process developed by Hydrocarbon Research Inc in 1963 mixes pulverized coal with recycled liquids hydrogen and catalyst in the ebullated bed reactor Advantages of this process are that dissolution and oil upgrading are taking place in the single reactor products have high HC ratio and a fast reaction time while the main disadvantages are high gas yield high hydrogen consumption and limitation of oil usage only as a boiler oil because of impurities The SRCI and SRCII Solvent Refined Coal processes were developed by Gulf Oil and implemented as pilot plants in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s The Nuclear Utility Services Corporation developed hydrogenation process which was patented by Wilburn C Schroeder in 1976 The process involved dried pulverized coal mixed with roughly 1wt molybdenum catalysts Hydrogenation occurred by use of high temperature and pressure syngas produced in a separate gasifier The process ultimately yielded a synthetic crude product Naphtha a limited amount of C3C4 gas lightmedium weight liquids C5C10 suitable for use as fuels small amounts of NH3 and significant amounts of CO2 Other singlestage hydrogenation processes are the Exxon Donor Solvent Process the Imhausen Highpressure Process and the Conoco Zinc Chloride Process There is also a number of twostage direct liquefaction processes however after the 1980s only the Catalytic Twostage Liquefaction Process modified from the HCoal Process the Liquid Solvent Extraction Process by British Coal and the Brown Coal Liquefaction Process of Japan have been developed Chevron Corporation developed a process invented by Joel W Rosenthal called the Chevron Coal Liquefaction Process CCLP It is unique due the closecoupling of the noncatalytic dissolver and the catalytic hydroprocessing unit The oil produced had properties that were unique when compared to other coal oils it was lighter and had far fewer heteroatom impurities The process was scaledup to the 6 ton per day level but not proven commercially Pyrolysis and carbonization processes See also Karrick process There are a number of different carbonization processes The carbonization conversion occurs through pyrolysis or destructive distillation and it produces condensable coal tar oil and water vapor noncondensable synthetic gas and a solid residuechar The condensed coal tar and oil are then further processed by hydrogenation to remove sulfur and nitrogen species after which they are processed into fuels The typical example of carbonization is the Karrick process The process was invented by Lewis Cass Karrick in the 1920s The Karrick process is a lowtemperature carbonization process where coal is heated at 680 °F 360 °C to 1380 °F 750 °C in the absence of air These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar However the produced liquids are mostly a byproduct and the main product is semicoke a solid and smokeless fuel The COED Process developed by FMC Corporation uses a fluidized bed for processing in combination with increasing temperature through four stages of pyrolysis Heat is transferred by hot gases produced by combustion of part of the produced char A modification of this process the COGAS Process involves the addition of gasification of char The TOSCOAL Process an analogue to the TOSCO II oil shale retorting process and LurgiRuhrgas process which is also used for the shale oil extraction uses hot recycled solids for the heat transfer Liquid yields of pyrolysis and Karrick processes are generally low for practical use for synthetic liquid fuel production Furthermore the resulting liquids are of low quality and require further treatment before they can be used as motor fuels In summary there is little possibility that this process will yield economically viable volumes of liquid fuel Biofuels processes One example of a Biofuelbased synthetic fuel process is Hydrotreated Renewable Jet HRJ fuel There are a number of variants of these processes under development and the testing and certification process for HRJ aviation fuels is beginning There are two such process under development by UOP One using solid biomass feedstocks and one using biooil and fats The process using solid secondgeneration biomass sources such as switchgrass or woody biomass uses pyrolysis to produce a biooil which is then catalytically stabilized and deoxygenated to produce a jetrange fuel The process using natural oils and fats goes through a deoxygenation process followed by hydrocracking and isomerization to produce a renewable Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene jet fuel Oil sand and oil shale processes See also Synthetic crude and Shale oil extraction Synthetic crude may also be created by upgrading bitumen a tar like substance found in oil sands or synthesizing liquid hydrocarbons from oil shale There are number of processes extracting shale oil synthetic crude oil from oil shale by pyrolysis hydrogenation or thermal dissolution Commercialization Main article Synthetic fuel commercialization Worldwide commercial synthetic fuels plant capacity is over 240000 barrels per day 38000 md including indirect conversion Fischer Tropsch plants in South Africa Mossgas Secunda CTL Qatar Oryx GTL and Malaysia Shell Bintulu and a Mobil process Methanol to Gasoline plant in New Zealand The leading company in the commercialization of synthetic fuel is Sasol a company based in South Africa Sasol operates the worlds only commercial Fischer Tropsch coaltoliquids facility at Secunda with a capacity of 150000 barrels per day 24000 md Numerous large projects are under construction in China and Qatar Some analysts believe that Chinese CTL production will exceed that of South Africa by 2015 and new and existing GTL capacity in Qatar should also exceed the July 2009 South African production level some time in 2011 Economics The economics of synthetic fuel manufacture vary greatly depending the feedstock used the precise process employed site characteristics such as feedstock and transportation costs and the cost of additional equipment required to control emissions The examples described below indicate a wide range of production costs between 20BBL for largescale gastoliquids to as much as 240BBL for smallscale biomasstoliquids Carbon Capture and Sequestration In order to be economically viable projects must do much better than just being competitive headtohead with oil They must also generate a sufficient return on investment to justify the capital investment in the project GTL economics A synthetic fuel manufactured from natural gas GTL without CCS in a large scale plant in the Middle East where gas is relatively inexpensive is expected as of 2005 to be competitive with oil down to approximately 20 per barrel Recent advances by the oil company Shell have seen synthetic fuels start to become profitable The company built a GTL gastoliquid plant in Qatar inaugurated in 2011 It was to be capable of producing 300000 barrels per day 48000 md of synthetic fuels and other products using natural gas as a feedstock CTLCBTLBTL economics According to a December 2007 study a medium scale 30000 BPD coaltoliquids plant CTL sited in the US using bituminous coal is expected to be competitive with oil down to roughly 52–56bbl crudeoil equivalent Adding carbon capture and sequestration to the project was expected to add an additional 10BBL to the required selling price though this may be offset by revenues from enhanced oil recovery or by tax credits or the eventual sale of carbon credits A recent NETL study examined the relative economics of a number of different process configurations for the production of indirect FT fuels using biomass coal and CCS This study determined a price at which the plant would not only be profitable but also make a sufficient return to yield a 20 return on the equity investment required to build the plant This chapter details an analysis which derives the Required Selling Price RSP of the FT diesel fuels produced in order to determine the economic feasibility and relative competitiveness of the different plant options A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how carbon control regulations such as an emissions trading scheme for transportation fuels would affect the price of both petroleumderived diesel and FT diesel from the different plants The key findings of these analyses were 1 CTL plants equipped with CCS are competitive at crude oil prices as low as 86 per barrel and have less life cycle GHG emissions than petroleumderived diesel These plants become more economically competitive as carbon prices increase 2 The incremental cost of adding simple CCS is very low 7 cents per gallon because CO2 capture is an inherent part of the FT process This becomes the economically preferred option at carbon prices above 5mtCO2eq27 3 BTL systems are hindered by limited biomass availability which affects the maximum plant size thereby limiting potential economies of scale This combined with relatively high biomass costs results in FT diesel prices which are double that of other configurations 645 to 696gal compared to 256 to 282gal for CTL and 15wt CBTL systems equipped with CCS The conclusion reached based on these findings was that both the CTL with CCS and the 8wt to 15wt CBTL with CCS configurations may offer the most pragmatic solutions to the nation’s energy strategy dilemma GHG emission reductions which are significant 5 to 33 below the petroleum baseline at diesel RSPs that are only half as much as the BTL options 256 to 282 per gallon compared to 645 to 696 per gallon for BTL These options are economically feasible when crude oil prices are 86 to 95 per barrel These economics can change in the event that plentiful lowcost biomass sources can be found lowing the cost of biomass inputs and improving economies of scale Economics for solid feedstock indirect FT process plants are further confused by carbon regulation Generally since permitting a CTL plant without CCS will likely be impossible and CTLCCS plants have a lower carbon footprint than conventional fuels carbon regulation is expected to be balancepositive for synthetic fuel production But it impacts the economics of different process configurations in different ways The NETL study picked a blended CBTL process using 515 biomass alongside coal as the most economical in a range of carbon price and probable future regulation scenarios Unfortunately because of scale and cost constraints pure BTL processes did not score well until very high carbon prices were assumed though again this may improve with better feedstocks and more efficient larger scale projects Chinese direct coal liquefaction economics Shenhua Group recently reported that their direct coal liquefaction process is competitive with oil prices above 60 per barrel Previous reports have indicated an anticipated cost of production of less than 30 per barrel based on a direct coal liquefaction process and a coal mining cost of under 10ton In October 2011 actual price of coal in China was as high as 135ton Security considerations A central consideration for the development of synthetic fuel is the security factor of securing domestic fuel supply from domestic biomass and coal Nations that are rich in biomass and coal can use synthetic fuel to offset their use of petroleum derived fuels and foreign oil Environmental considerations The environmental footprint of a given synthetic fuel varies greatly depending on which process is employed what feedstock is used what pollution controls are employed and what the transportation distance and method are for both feedstock procurement and endproduct distribution In many locations project development will not be possible due to permitting restrictions if a process design is chosen that does not meet local requirements for clean air water and increasingly lifecycle carbon emissions Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions Among different indirect FT synthetic fuels production technologies potential emissions of greenhouse gasses vary greatly Coal to liquids CTL without carbon capture and sequestration CCS is expected to result in a significantly higher carbon footprint than conventional petroleumderived fuels 147 On the other hand biomasstoliquids with CCS could deliver a 358 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions Both of these plants fundamentally use gasification and FT conversion synthetic fuels technology but they deliver wildly divergent environmental footprints Generally CTL without CCS has a higher greenhouse gas footprint CTL with CCS has a 915 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to that of petroleum derived diesel CBTLCCS plants that blend biomass alongside coal while sequestering carbon do progressively better the more biomass is added Depending on the type of biomass the assumptions about root storage and the transportation logistics at conservatively 40 biomass alongside coal CBTLCCS plants achieve a neutral lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint At more than 40 biomass they begin to go lifecycle negative and effectively store carbon in the ground for every gallon of fuels that they produce Ultimately BTL plants employing CCS could store massive amounts of carbon while producing transportation fuels from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks although there are a number of significant economic hurdles and a few technical hurdles that would have to be overcome to enable the development of such facilities Serious consideration must also be given to the type and method of feedstock procurement for either the coal or biomass used in such facilities as reckless development could exacerbate environmental problems caused by mountaintop removal mining land use change fertilizer runoff food vs fuels concerns or many other potential factors Or they could not depending entirely on projectspecific factors on a plantbyplant basis A study from US Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory with much more indepth information of CBTL lifecycle emissions Affordable Low Carbon Diesel from Domestic Coal and Biomass Hybrid hydrogencarbon processes have also been proposed recently as another closedcarbon cycle alternative combining clean electricity recycled CO H2 and captured CO2 with biomass as inputs as a way of reducing the biomass needed Fuels emissions The fuels produced by the various synthetic fuels process also have a wide range of potential environmental performance though they tend to be very uniform based on the type of synthetic fuels process used ie the tailpipe emissions characteristics of Fischer Tropsch diesel tend to be the same though their lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint can vary substantially based on which plant produced the fuel depending on feedstock and plant level sequestration considerations In particular Fischer tropsch diesel and jet fuels deliver dramatic acrosstheboard reductions in all major criteria pollutants such as SOx NOx Particulate Matter and Hydrocarbon emissions These fuels because of their high level of purity and lack of contaminants further enable the use of advanced emissions control equipment that has been shown to virtually eliminate HC CO and PM emissions from diesel vehicles In testimony before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the US House of Representatives the following statement was made by a senior scientist from Rentech FT fuels offer numerous benefits to aviation users The first is an immediate reduction in particulate emissions FT jet fuel has been shown in laboratory combusters and engines to reduce PM emissions by 96 at idle and 78 under cruise operation Validation of the reduction in other turbine engine emissions is still under way Concurrent to the PM reductions is an immediate reduction in CO2 emissions from FT fuel FT fuels inherently reduce CO2 emissions because they have higher energy content per carbon content of the fuel and the fuel is less dense than conventional jet fuel allowing aircraft to fly further on the same load of fuel The cleanness of these FT synthetic fuels is further demonstrated by the fact that they are sufficiently nontoxic and environmentally benign as to be considered biodegradable This owes primarily to the nearabsence of sulfur and extremely low level of aromatics present in the fuel Using Fischer Tropsch diesel results in dramatic across the board tailpipe emissions reductions relative to conventional fuels Using Fischer Tropsch jet fuels have been proven to dramatically reduce particulate and other aircraft emissions Sustainability One concern commonly raised about the development of synthetic fuels plants is sustainability Fundamentally transitioning from oil to coal or natural gas for transportation fuels production is a transition from one inherently depletable geologically limited resource to another One of the positive defining characteristics of synthetic fuels production is the ability to use multiple feedstocks coal gas or biomass to produce the same product from the same plant In the case of hybrid BCTL plants some facilities are already planning to use a significant biomass component alongside coal Ultimately given the right location with good biomass availability and sufficiently high oil prices synthetic fuels plants can be transitioned from coal or gas over to a 100 biomass feedstock This provides a path forward towards a renewable fuel source and possibly more sustainable even if the plant originally produced fuels solely from coal making the infrastructure forwardscompatible even if the original fossil feedstock runs out Some synthetic fuels processes can be converted to sustainable production practices more easily than others depending on the process equipment selected This is an important design consideration as these facilities are planned and implemented as additional room must be left in the plant layout to accommodate whatever future plant change requirements in terms of materials handling and gasification might be necessary to accommodate a future change in production profile See also Energy portal Renewable energy portal Ammonia Biofuel Butanol fuel Carbon neutral fuel
