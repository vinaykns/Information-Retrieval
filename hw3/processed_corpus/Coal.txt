 For other uses see Coal disambiguation Coal is a combustible black or brownishblack sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams The harder forms such as anthracite coal can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure Coal is composed primarily of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements chiefly hydrogen sulfur oxygen and nitrogen A fossil fuel coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat which in turn is converted into lignite then subbituminous coal after that bituminous coal and lastly anthracite This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time Throughout history coal has been used as an energy resource primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat and is also used for industrial purposes such as refining metals Coal is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide as well as one of the largest worldwide anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide releases The extraction of coal its use in energy production and its byproducts are all associated with environmental and health effects including climate change Coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining Since 1983 the worlds top coal producer has been China In 2015 China produced 3747 million tonnes of coal – 477 of 7861 million tonnes world coal production In 2015 other large producers were United States 813 million tonnes India 678 European Union 539 and Australia 503 In 2010 the largest exporters were Australia with 328 million tonnes 271 of world coal export and Indonesia with 316 million tonnes 261 while the largest importers were Japan with 207 million tonnes 175 of world coal import China with 195 million tonnes 166 and South Korea with 126 million tonnes 107 Etymology The word originally took the form col in Old English from ProtoGermanic kulan which in turn is hypothesized to come from the ProtoIndoEuropean root geulo live coal Germanic cognates include the Old Frisian kole Middle Dutch cole Dutch kool Old High German chol German Kohle and Old Norse kol and the Irish word gual is also a cognate via the IndoEuropean root In Old Turkic languages kül is ashes cinders öčür is quench The compound charcoal in Turkic is öčürülmüş kül literally quenched ashes cinders coals with elided anlaut ö and inflection affixes ülmüş The word took on the meaning mineral consisting of fossilized carbon in the thirteenth century Often the terms coal plant or coal power plant are used referring to the presumed origin of coal being old fossilized plants Formation At various times in the geologic past the Earth had dense forests in lowlying wetland areas Due to natural processes such as flooding these forests were buried underneath soil As more and more soil deposited over them they were compressed The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper As the process continued the plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation usually by mud or acidic water This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments Under high pressure and high temperature dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal As coal contains mainly carbon the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization The wide shallow seas of the Carboniferous Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation although coal is known from most geological periods The exception is the coal gap in the Permian–Triassic extinction event where coal is rare Coal is known from Precambrian strata which predate land plants — this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae Ranks As geological processes apply pressure to dead biotic material over time under suitable conditions its metamorphic grade increases successively into Peat considered to be a precursor of coal has industrial importance as a fuel in some regions for example Ireland and Finland In its dehydrated form peat is a highly effective absorbent for fuel and oil spills on land and water It is also used as a conditioner for soil to make it more able to retain and slowly release water Lignite or brown coal is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation Jet a compact form of lignite is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the Upper Palaeolithic Subbituminous coal whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal is used primarily as fuel for steamelectric power generation and is an important source of light aromatic hydrocarbons for the chemical synthesis industry Bituminous coal is a dense sedimentary rock usually black but sometimes dark brown often with welldefined bands of bright and dull material it is used primarily as fuel in steamelectric power generation with substantial quantities used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make coke Steam coal is a grade between bituminous coal and anthracite once widely used as a fuel for steam locomotives In this specialized use it is sometimes known as sea coal in the US Small steam coal dry small steam nuts or DSSN was used as a fuel for domestic water heating Anthracite the highest rank of coal is a harder glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial space heating It may be divided further into metamorphically altered bituminous coal and petrified oil as from the deposits in Pennsylvania Graphite is one of the more difficult coals to ignite and is not commonly used as fuel — it is mostly used in pencils and when powdered as a lubricant The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles However the exact classification varies between countries According to the German classification coal is classified as follows The middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the Englishlanguage subbituminous to bituminous coal while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite but more inclusive US anthracite has 6 volatiles Cannel coal sometimes called candle coal is a variety of finegrained highrank coal with significant hydrogen content It consists primarily of exinite macerals now termed liptinite Hilts law Main article Hilts law Hilts law is a geological term that states that in a small area the deeper the coal the higher its rank grade The law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank irrespective of depth Content Early uses as fuel Further information History of coal mining The earliest recognized use is from the Shenyang area of China 4000 BC where Neolithic inhabitants had begun carving ornaments from black lignite Coal from the Fushun mine in northeastern China was used to smelt copper as early as 1000 BCE Marco Polo the Italian who traveled to China in the 13th century described coal as black stones  which burn like logs and said coal was so plentiful people could take three hot baths a week In Europe the earliest reference to the use of coal as fuel is from the geological treatise On stones Lap 16 by the Greek scientist Theophrastus circa 371–287 BC Among the materials that are dug because they are useful those known as anthrakes coals are made of earth and once set on fire they burn like charcoal They are found in Liguria  and in Elis as one approaches Olympia by the mountain road and they are used by those who work in metals — Theophrastus On Stones 16 translation Outcrop coal was used in Britain during the Bronze Age 3000–2000 BC where it has been detected as forming part of the composition of funeral pyres In Roman Britain with the exception of two modern fields the Romans were exploiting coals in all the major coalfields in England and Wales by the end of the second century AD Evidence of trade in coal dated to about AD 200 has been found at the Roman settlement at Heronbridge near Chester and in the Fenlands of East Anglia where coal from the Midlands was transported via the Car Dyke for use in drying grain Coal cinders have been found in the hearths of villas and Roman forts particularly in Northumberland dated to around AD 400 In the west of England contemporary writers described the wonder of a permanent brazier of coal on the altar of Minerva at Aquae Sulis modern day Bath although in fact easily accessible surface coal from what became the Somerset coalfield was in common use in quite lowly dwellings locally Evidence of coals use for ironworking in the city during the Roman period has been found In Eschweiler Rhineland deposits of bituminous coal were used by the Romans for the smelting of iron ore No evidence exists of the product being of great importance in Britain before the High Middle Ages after about AD 1000 Mineral coal came to be referred to as seacoal in the 13th century the wharf where the material arrived in London was known as Seacoal Lane so identified in a charter of King Henry III granted in 1253 Initially the name was given because much coal was found on the shore having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops but by the time of Henry VIII it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to London by sea In 1257–59 coal from Newcastle upon Tyne was shipped to London for the smiths and limeburners building Westminster Abbey Seacoal Lane and Newcastle Lane where coal was unloaded at wharves along the River Fleet are still in existence See Industrial processes below for modern uses of the term These easily accessible sources had largely become exhausted or could not meet the growing demand by the 13th century when underground extraction by shaft mining or adits was developed The alternative name was pitcoal because it came from mines The development of the Industrial Revolution led to the largescale use of coal as the steam engine took over from the water wheel In 1700 fivesixths of the worlds coal was mined in Britain Britain would have run out of suitable sites for watermills by the 1830s if coal had not been available as a source of energy In 1947 there were some 750000 miners in Britain but by 2004 this had shrunk to some 5000 miners working in around 20 collieries Uses today Coal as fuel Further information Electricity generation Clean coal technology Coal electricity Global warming and List of coal power stations Coal is primarily used as a solid fuel to produce electricity and heat through combustion World coal consumption was about 725 billion tonnes in 2010 799 billion short tons and is expected to increase 48 to 905 billion tonnes 998 billion short tons by 2030 Efforts around the world to reduce the use of coal has led some regions to switch to natural gas China produced 347 billion tonnes 383 billion short tons in 2011 India produced about 578 million tonnes 6371 million short tons in 2011 687 of Chinas electricity comes from coal The US consumed about 13 of the world total in 2010 ie 951 million tonnes 105 billion short tons using 93 of it for generation of electricity 46 of total power generated in the US was using coal The United States Energy Information Administration estimates coal reserves at 7011948000000000000♠948×10 short tons 860 Gt One estimate for resources is 18000 Gt When coal is used for electricity generation it is usually pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity The thermodynamic efficiency of this process has been improved over time some older coalfired power stations have thermal efficiencies in the vicinity of 25 whereas the newest supercritical and ultrasupercritical steam cycle turbines operating at temperatures over 600 °C and pressures over 27 MPa over 3900 psi can achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 45 LHV basis using anthracite fuel or around 43 LHV basis even when using lowergrade lignite fuel Further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved predrying especially relevant with highmoisture fuel such as lignite or biomass and cooling technologies An alternative approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle IGCC power plant Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steamgenerating boiler the coal is gasified see coal gasification to create syngas which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity just like natural gas is burned in a turbine Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a heat recovery steam generator which powers a supplemental steam turbine Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39 to 42 HHV basis or ≈42–45 LHV basis for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies Shell GE Gasifier CBI IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coalfueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions and allow for relatively easy carbon capture At least 40 of the worlds electricity comes from coal and in 2012 about onethird of the United States electricity came from coal down from approximately 49 in 2008 As of 2012 in the United States use of coal to generate electricity was declining as plentiful supplies of natural gas obtained by hydraulic fracturing of tight shale formations became available at low prices In Denmark a net electric efficiency of 47 has been obtained at the coalfired Nordjyllandsværket CHP Plant and an overall plant efficiency of up to 91 with cogeneration of electricity and district heating The multifuelfired Avedøreværket CHP Plant just outside Copenhagen can achieve a net electric efficiency as high as 49 The overall plant efficiency with cogeneration of electricity and district heating can reach as much as 94 An alternative form of coal combustion is as coalwater slurry fuel CWS which was developed in the Soviet Union Other ways to use coal are combined heat and power cogeneration and an MHD topping cycle The total known deposits recoverable by current technologies including highly polluting lowenergy content types of coal ie lignite bituminous is sufficient for many years Consumption is increasing and maximal production could be reached within decades see world coal reserves below On the other hand much may have to be left in the ground to avoid climate change Coking coal and use of coke Main article Coke fuel Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from lowash lowsulfur bituminous coal metallurgical coal from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1000 °C 1832 °F so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together Metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace The result is pig iron and is too rich in dissolved carbon so it must be treated further to make steel The coking coal should be low in sulfur and phosphorus so they do not migrate to the metal Based on the ash percentage the coking coal can be divided into various grades These grades are Steel Grade I Ash content not exceeding 15 Steel Grade II Exceeding 15 but not exceeding 18 Washery Grade I Exceeding 18 but not exceeding 21 Washery Grade II Exceeding 21 but not exceeding 24 Washery Grade III Exceeding 24 but not exceeding 28 Washery Grade IV Exceeding 28 but not exceeding 35 The coke must be strong enough to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route However the alternative route is direct reduced iron where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron Coke from coal is grey hard and porous and has a heating value of 248 million Btuton 296 MJkg Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts including coal tar ammonia light oils and coal gas Petroleum coke is the solid residue obtained in oil refining which resembles coke but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications Gasification Main articles Coal gasification and Underground coal gasification Coal gasification can be used to produce syngas a mixture of carbon monoxide CO and hydrogen H2 gas Often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel through the FischerTropsch process alternatively syngas can be converted into methanol which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process Gasification combined with FischerTropsch technology is currently used by the Sasol chemical company of South Africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas Alternatively the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes such as powering a hydrogen economy making ammonia or upgrading fossil fuels During gasification the coal is mixed with oxygen and steam while also being heated and pressurized During the reaction oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal into carbon monoxide CO while also releasing hydrogen gas H2 This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of town gas which was piped to customers to burn for illumination heating and cooking If the refiner wants to produce gasoline the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a FischerTropsch reaction If hydrogen is the desired endproduct however the syngas is fed into the water gas shift reaction where more hydrogen is liberated Liquefaction Main article Coal liquefaction Coal can also be converted into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion In the direct liquefaction processes the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process the SRCI and SRCII Solvent Refined Coal processes the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other singlestage and twostage processes In the process of lowtemperature carbonization coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750 °C 680 and 1380 °F These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar The coal tar is then further processed into fuels An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available Coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide CO2 emissions in the conversion process If coal liquefaction is done without employing either carbon capture and storage CCS technologies or biomass blending the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from crude oil If CCS technologies are employed reductions of 5–12 can be achieved in Coal to Liquid CTL plants and up to a 75 reduction is achievable when cogasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass 30 biomass by weight in coalbiomasstoliquids plants For future synthetic fuel projects carbon dioxide sequestration is proposed to avoid releasing CO2 into the atmosphere Sequestration adds to the cost of production Refined coal Main article Refined coal Refined coal is the product of a coalupgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lowerrank coals such as subbituminous and lignite brown coals It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coals characteristics before it is burned The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned Depending on the situation precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coalfueled boilers Industrial processes Finely ground bituminous coal known in this application as sea coal is a constituent of foundry sand While the molten metal is in the mould the coal burns slowly releasing reducing gases at pressure and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand It is also contained in mould wash a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining the bod used for the bottom of a cupola furnace When heated the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal Production of chemicals Coal is an important feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products The main route to these products is coal gasification to produce syngas Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include methanol hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured including olefins acetic acid formaldehyde ammonia urea and others The versatility of syngas as a precursor to primary chemicals and highvalue derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities Historically production of chemicals from coal has been used since the 1950s and has become established in the market According to the 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database a survey of current and planned gasifiers from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37 to 45 From 2008 to 2010 22 of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production Because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from natural gas and petroleum the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most costeffective Therefore interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production Also production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa China India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there In the United States the best example of the industry is Eastman Chemical Company which has been successfully operating a coaltochemicals plant at its Kingsport Tennessee site since 1983 Similarly Sasol has built and operated coaltochemicals facilities in South Africa Coal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water As of 2013 much of the coal to chemical production was in the Peoples Republic of China where environmental regulation and water management was weak Coal

Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 and Coal Industry Commission Act 1919 Coal as a traded commodity In North America Central Appalachian coal futures contracts are currently traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange trading symbol QL The trading unit is 1550 short tons 1410 t per contract and is quoted in US dollars and cents per ton Since coal is the principal fuel for generating electricity in the United States coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the electric power industry an important tool for hedging and risk management In addition to the NYMEX contract the Intercontinental Exchange ICE has European Rotterdam and South African Richards Bay coal futures available for trading The trading unit for these contracts is 5000 tonnes 5500 short tons and are also quoted in US dollars and cents per ton The price of coal increased from around 3000 per short ton in 2000 to around 15000 per short ton as of September 2008 As of October 2008 the price per short ton had declined to 11150 Prices further declined to 7125 as of October 2010 In early 2015 it was trading near 56ton Environmental and health effects Main article Environmental impact of the coal industry Health effects The use of coal as fuel causes adverse health impacts and deaths The deadly London smog was caused primarily by the heavy use of coal In the United States coalfired power plants were estimated in 2004 to cause nearly 24000 premature deaths every year including 2800 from lung cancer Annual health costs in Europe from use of coal to generate electricity are €428 billion or 55 billion Yet the disease and mortality burden of coal use today falls most heavily upon China Breathing in coal dust causes coalworkers pneumoconiosis which is known colloquially as black lung socalled because the coal dust literally turns the lungs black from their usual pink color In the United States alone it is estimated that 1500 former employees of the coal industry die every year from the effects of breathing in coal mine dust Around 10 of coal is ash Coal ash is hazardous and toxic to human beings and other living things Coal ash contains the radioactive elements uranium and thorium Coal ash and other solid combustion byproducts are stored locally and escape in various ways that expose those living near coal plants to radiation and environmental toxics Huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually In 2013 the US alone consumed on the order of 983 million short tonnes of coal per year Use of coal on this scale generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year These include fly ash bottom ash and fluegas desulfurization sludge that contain mercury uranium thorium arsenic and other heavy metals along with nonmetals such as selenium The American Lung Association the American Nurses Association and the Physicians for Social Responsibility released a report in 2009 which details in depth the detrimental impact of the coal industry on human health including workers in the mines and individuals living in communities near plants burning coal as a power source This report provides medical information regarding damage to the lungs heart and nervous system of Americans caused by the burning of coal as fuel It details how the air pollution caused by the plume of coal smokestack emissions is a cause of asthma strokes reduced intelligence artery blockages heart attacks congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias mercury poisoning arterial occlusion and lung cancer More recently the Chicago School of Public Health released a largely similar report echoing many of the same findings Though coal burning has increasingly been supplanted by lesstoxic natural gas use in recent years a 2010 study by the Clean Air Task Force still estimated that air pollution from coalfired power plants accounts for more than 13000 premature deaths 20000 heart attacks and 16 million lost workdays in the US each year The total monetary cost of these health impacts is over 100 billion annually The WHO classifies coal as a dirty fuel and encourages the movement away from such fuels towards cleaner alternatives Environmental effects Coal mining and coal fueling of power station and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage Water systems are affected by coal mining For example mining affects groundwater and water table levels and acidity Spills of fly ash such as the Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill can also contaminate land and waterways and destroy homes Power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water This can affect the flows of rivers and has consequential impacts on other land uses One of the earliest known impacts of coal on the water cycle was acid rain Approximately 75 TgS per year of sulfur dioxide SO2 is released from burning coal After release the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H2SO2 which scatters solar radiation hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases However the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years Release of SO2 also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems Disused coal mines can also cause issues Subsidence can occur above tunnels causing damage to infrastructure or cropland Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires and it has been estimated that thousands of coal seam fires are burning at any given time For example there is a coal seam fire in Germany that has been burning since 1668 and is still burning in the 21st century Some environmental impacts are modest such as dust nuisance However perhaps the largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas that causes climate change and global warming according to the IPCC and the EPA Coal is the largest contributor to the humanmade increase of CO2 in the atmosphere The production of coke from coal produces ammonia coal tar and gaseous compounds as byproducts which if discharged to land air or waterways can act as environmental pollutants The Whyalla steelworks is one example of a coke producing facility where liquid ammonia is discharged to the marine environment In 1999 world gross carbon dioxide emissions from coal usage were 8666 million tonnes of carbon dioxide In 2011 world gross emissions from coal usage were 14416 million tonnes For every megawatthour generated coalfired electric power generation emits around 2000 pounds of carbon dioxide which is almost double the approximately 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide released by a natural gasfired electric plant Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation as the market in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation carbon dioxide emissions may have fallen Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992 In 2013 the head of the UN climate agency advised that most of the worlds coal reserves should be left in the ground to avoid catastrophic global warming Clean coal technology Main article Clean coal technology Clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation Those technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal gasification see also IGCC improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals brown coals to improve the calorific value and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity Figures from the United States Environmental Protection Agency show that these technologies have made todays coalbased generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal Historically the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx the most important gases in causation of acid rain and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health More recent focus has been on carbon dioxide due to its impact on global warming and concern over toxic species such as mercury Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept Precombustion capture – This involves gasification of a feedstock such as coal to form synthesis gas which may be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2rich gas mixture from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated transported and ultimately sequestered This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations Postcombustion capture – This refers to capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes typically using sorbents solvents or membrane separations to remove CO2 from the bulk gases Oxyfuel combustion – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen rather than in air which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient lowcost CO2 capture The Kemper County IGCC Project a 582 MW coal gasificationbased power plant will use precombustion capture of CO2 to capture 65 of the CO2 the plant produces which will be utilizedgeologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations The Saskatchewan Governments Boundary Dam Power Station Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use postcombustion aminebased scrubber technology to capture 90 of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields An early example of a coalbased plant using oxyfuel carboncapture technology is Swedish company Vattenfalls Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg Germany built by German firm Siemens which went online in September 2008 The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants separates them and compresses the CO2 into a liquid Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical In 2014 research and development were discontinued due to high costs making the technology unviable Bioremediation The white rot fungus Trametes versicolor can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal The bacteria Diplococcus has been found to degrade coal raising its temperature Economic aspects Coal by liquefaction technology is one of the backstop resources that could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic US production of fuel from coal becomes costcompetitive with oil priced at around 35 per barrel with the 35 being the breakeven cost With oil prices as low as around 40 per barrel in the US as of December 2008 liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the US but will probably be revitalized similar to oil sand projects with an oil price around 70 per barrel In China due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below 40 per barrel This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves As oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009 the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of 40 China is the largest producer of coal in the world It is the worlds largest energy consumer and relies on coal to supply 69 of its energy needs An estimated 5 million people worked in Chinas coalmining industry in 2007 Coal pollution costs the EU €43 billion each year Measures to cut air pollution may have beneficial longterm economic impacts for individuals Energy density and carbon impact See also Energy value of coal The energy density of coal ie its heating value is roughly 24 megajoules per kilogram approximately 67 kilowatthours per kg For a coal power plant with a 40 efficiency it takes an estimated 325 kg 717 lb of coal to power a 100 W lightbulb for one year As of 2006 the average efficiency of electricitygenerating power stations was 31 in 2002 coal represented about 23 of total global energy supply an equivalent of 34 billion tonnes of coal of which 28 billion tonnes were used for electricity generation The US Energy Information Agencys 1999 report on CO2 emissions for energy generation quotes an emission factor of 0963 kg CO2kWh for coal power compared to 0881 kg CO2kWh oil or 0569 kg CO2kWh natural gas Underground fires Main article Coal seam fire Thousands of coal fires are burning around the world Those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished Fires can cause the ground above to subside their combustion gases are dangerous to life and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen air can no longer reach the flame front A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2 amounting to 2–3 of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels In Centralia Pennsylvania a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful and it continues to burn underground to this day The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6000 years At Kuh i Malik in Yagnob Valley Tajikistan coal deposits have been burning for thousands of years creating vast underground labyrinths full of unique minerals some of them very beautiful Local people once used this method to mine ammoniac This place has been wellknown since the time of Herodotus but European geographers misinterpreted the Ancient Greek descriptions as the evidence of active volcanism in Turkestan up to the 19th century when the Russian army invaded the area The reddish siltstone rock that caps many ridges and buttes in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and in western North Dakota is called porcelanite which resembles the coal burning waste clinker or volcanic scoria Clinker is rock that has been fused by the natural burning of coal In the Powder River Basin approximately 27 to 54 billion tons of coal burned within the past three million years Wild coal fires in the area were reported by the Lewis and Clark Expedition as well as explorers and settlers in the area Market trends World coal reserves The 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the Energy Information Administration are equal to about 4196 BBOE billion barrels of oil equivalent The amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7075 billion short tons or 133179 quadrillion BTUs This is an average of 188 million BTU per short ton In terms of heat content this is about 57000000 barrels 9100000 m of oil equivalent per day By comparison in 2007 natural gas provided 51000000 barrels 8100000 m of oil equivalent per day while oil provided 85800000 barrels 13640000 m per day British Petroleum in its 2007 report estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years reservestoproduction ratio based on proven coal reserves worldwide This figure only includes reserves classified as proven exploration drilling programs by mining companies particularly in underexplored areas are continually providing new reserves In many cases companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as proven However some nations havent updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals Of the three fossil fuels coal has the most widely distributed reserves coal is mined in over 100 countries and on all continents except Antarctica The largest reserves are found in the United States Russia China Australia and India Note the table below Major coal producers See also List of countries by coal production The reserve life is an estimate based only on current production levels and proved reserves level for the countries shown and makes no assumptions of future production or even current production trends Countries with annual production higher than 100 million tonnes are shown For comparison data for the European Union is also shown Shares are based on data expressed in tonnes oil equivalent Major coal consumers Countries with annual consumption higher than 100 million tonnes are shown For comparison data for the European Union is also shown Shares are based on data expressed in tonnes oil equivalent Major coal exporters Countries with annual gross export higher than 10 million tonnes are shown In terms of net export the largest exporters are still Australia 3281 millions tonnes Indonesia 3162 and Russia 1002 Major coal importers Countries with annual gross import higher than 20 million tonnes are shown In terms of net import the largest importers are still Japan 2060 millions tonnes China 1724 and South Korea 1258 Cultural usage Coal is the official state mineral of Kentucky and the official state rock of Utah both US states have a historic link to coal mining Some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from Santa Claus for Christmas in their christmas stockings instead of presents It is also customary and considered lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Years Day This occurs as part of FirstFooting and represents warmth for the year to come See also Energy portal
