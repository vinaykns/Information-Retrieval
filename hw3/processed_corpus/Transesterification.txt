 In organic chemistry transesterification ˌtrænzˌɛstərᵻfᵻˈkeɪʃən is the process of exchanging the organic group R″ of an ester with the organic group R′ of an alcohol These reactions are often catalyzed by the addition of an acid or base catalyst The reaction can also be accomplished with the help of enzymes biocatalysts particularly lipases EC3113 Strong acids catalyse the reaction by donating a proton to the carbonyl group thus making it a more potent electrophile whereas bases catalyse the reaction by removing a proton from the alcohol thus making it more nucleophilic Esters with larger alkoxy groups can be made from methyl or ethyl esters in high purity by heating the mixture of ester acidbase and large alcohol and evaporating the small alcohol to drive equilibrium Mechanism In the transesterification mechanism the carbonyl carbon of the starting ester RCOOR undergoes nucleophilic attack by the incoming alkoxide RO to give a tetrahedral intermediate which either reverts to the starting material or proceeds to the transesterified product RCOOR The various species exist in equilibrium and the product distribution depends on the relative energies of the reactant and product Applications Polyester production The largest scale application of transesterification is in the synthesis of polyesters In this application diesters undergo transesterification with diols to form macromolecules For example dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol react to form polyethylene terephthalate and methanol which is evaporated to drive the reaction forward Methanolysis and biodiesel production The reverse reaction methanolysis is also an example of transesterification This process has been used to recycle polyesters into individual monomers see plastic recycling It is also used to convert fats triglycerides into biodiesel This conversion was one of the first uses Transesterified vegetable oil biodiesel was used to power heavyduty vehicles in South Africa before World War II It was patented in the US in the 1950s by Colgate though biolipid transesterification may have been discovered much earlier In the 1940s researchers were looking for a method to more readily produce glycerol which was used to produce explosives for World War II Many of the methods used today by producers and home brewers have their origin in the original 1940s research Biolipid transesterification has also been recently shown by Japanese researchers to be possible using a supercritical methanol methodology whereby high temperature highpressure vessels are used to physically catalyze the biolipidmethanol reaction into fattyacid methyl esters Highpressure transesterification Basecatalyzed transesterification is characterized by a negative activation volume approx −12 cmmol and therefore it proceeds faster under highpressure conditions It has been shown that aminecatalyzed alcoholysis of sterically hindered esters eg protecting groups chiral auxiliaries proceeds rapidly at room temperature under 10 kbar pressure giving quantitative yields See also Biodiesel production Interesterified fat Oteras catalyst Transalkylation Transamidification Cocaethylene References Wilhelm Riemenschneider1 and Hermann M Bolt Esters Organic Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005 WileyVCH Weinheim doi10100214356007a09565pub2 Romanski J Nowak P Kosinski K Jurczak J Sep 2012 Highpressure transesterification of sterically hindered esters Tetrahedron Lett 53 39 5287–5289 doi101016jtetlet201207094
