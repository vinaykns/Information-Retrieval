 Not to be confused with Development economics Economic development is the process by which a nation improves the economic political and social wellbeing of its people The term has been used frequently by economists politicians and others in the 20th and 21st centuries The concept however has been in existence in the West for centuries Modernization Westernization and especially Industrialization are other terms people have used while discussing economic development Economic development has a direct relationship with the environment and environmental issues Whereas economic development is a policy intervention endeavor with aims of economic and social wellbeing of people economic growth is a phenomenon of market productivity and rise in GDP Consequently as economist Amartya Sen points out economic growth is one aspect of the process of economic development Type See also Development economics The scope of economic development includes the process and policies by which a nation improves the economic political and social wellbeing of its people The University of Iowas Center for International Finance and Development states that Although nobody is certain when the concept originated some people agree that development is closely bound up with the evolution of capitalism and the demise of feudalism Mansell and When also state that economic development has been understood since the World War II to involve economic growth namely the increases in per capita income and if currently absent the attainment of a standard of living equivalent to that of industrialized countries Economic development can also be considered as a static theory that documents the state of an economy at a certain time According to Schumpeter and Backhaus 2003 the changes in this equilibrium state to document in economic theory can only be caused by intervening factors coming from the outside History Economic development originated in the postwar period of reconstruction initiated by the United States In 1949 during his inaugural speech President Harry Truman identified the development of undeveloped areas as a priority for the west There have been several major phases of development theory since 1945 From the 1940s to the 1960s the state played a large role in promoting industrialization in developing countries following the idea of modernization theory This period was followed by a brief period of basic needs development focusing on human capital development and redistribution in the 1970s Neoliberalism emerged in the 1980s pushing an agenda of free trade and removal of Import Substitution Industrialization policies In economics the study of economic development was borne out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on national product or the aggregate output of goods and services Economic development was concerned in the expansion of people’s entitlements and their corresponding capabilities morbidity nourishment literacy education and other socioeconomic indicators Borne out of the backdrop of Keynesian advocating government intervention and neoclassical economics stressing reduced intervention with rise of highgrowth countries Singapore South Korea Hong Kong and planned governments Argentina Chile Sudan Uganda economic development more generally development economics emerged amidst these mid20th century theoretical interpretations of how economies prosper Also economist Albert O Hirschman a major contributor to development economics asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the poor regions of the world primarily in Africa Asia and Latin America yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models It has also been argued notably by Asian and European proponents of infrastructurebased development that systematic longterm government investments in transportation housing education and healthcare are necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in emerging countries Growth and development Economic growth deals with increase in the level of output but economic development is related to increase in output coupled with improvement in social and political welfare of people within a country Therefore economic development encompasses both growth and welfare values Dependency theorists argue that poor countries have sometimes experienced economic growth with little or no economic development initiatives for instance in cases where they have functioned mainly as resourceproviders to wealthy industrialized countries There is an opposing argument however that growth causes development because some of the increase in income gets spent on human development such as education and health According to Ranis et al economic growth and development is a twoway relationship According to them the first chain consists of economic growth benefiting human development since economic growth is likely to lead families and individuals to use their heightened incomes to increase expenditures which in turn furthers human development At the same time with the increased consumption and spending health education and infrastructure systems grow and contribute to economic growth In addition to increasing private incomes economic growth also generate additional resources that can be used to improve social services such as healthcare safe drinking water etc By generating additional resources for social services unequal income distribution will be mitigated as such social services are distributed equally across each community thereby benefiting each individual Concisely the relationship between human development and economic development can be explained in three ways First increase in average income leads to improvement in health and nutrition known as Capability Expansion through Economic Growth Second it is believed that social outcomes can only be improved by reducing income poverty known as Capability Expansion through Poverty Reduction Lastly social outcomes can also be improved with essential services such as education healthcare and clean drinking water known as Capability Expansion through Social Services John Joseph Puthenkalams research aims at the process of economic growth theories that lead to economic development After analyzing the existing capitalistic growthdevelopment theoretical apparatus he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom democracy and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future economic growthdevelopment of any nation depends on this emerging model as we witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the Middle East He develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of micro knowledge and macro knowledge Micro knowledge is what an individual learns from school or from various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently receive How to combine both these knowledge would determine further growth that leads to economic development of developing nations Yet others believe that a number of basic building blocks need to be in place for growth and development to take place For instance some economists believe that a fundamental first step toward development and growth is to address property rights issues otherwise only a small part of the economic sector will be able to participate in growth That is without inclusive property rights in the equation the informal sector will remain outside the mainstream economy excluded and without the same opportunities for study Goals In the United States Project Socrates outlined competitiveness as the driving factor for successful economic development in government and industry By addressing technology directly to meet customer needs competitiveness was fostered in the surrounding environment and resulted in greater economic performance and sustained growth Economic development typically involves improvements in a variety of indicators such as literacy rates life expectancy and poverty rates GDP does not take into account other aspects such as leisure time environmental quality interracial and united international peace freedom or social justice alternative measures of economic wellbeing have been proposed Essentially a countrys economic development is related to its human development which encompasses among other things health and education These factors are however closely related to economic growth so that development and growth often go together Due to globalization growth and development in those countries are interrelated to trends on international trade and participation in Global Value Chains GVCs and international financial markets The last financial crisis had a huge effect on economies in developing countries Economist Jayati Ghosh states that it is necessary to make financial markets in developing countries more resilient by providing a variety of financial institutions This could also add to financial security for smallscale producers Regional policy In its broadest sense policies of economic development encompass three major areas Governments undertaking to meet broad economic objectives such as price stability high employment and sustainable growth Such efforts include monetary and fiscal policies regulation of financial institutions trade and tax policies Programs that provide infrastructure and services such as highways parks affordable housing crime prevention and K–12 education Job creation and retention through specific efforts in business finance marketing neighborhood development workforce development small business development business retention and expansion technology transfer and real estate development This third category is a primary focus of economic development professionals One growing understanding in economic development is the promotion of regional clusters and a thriving metropolitan economy In today’s global landscape location is vitally important and becomes a key in competitive advantage International trade and exchange rates are a key issue in economic development Currencies are often either undervalued or overvalued resulting in trade surpluses or deficits Organization Main article economic development organization Economic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners The practitioners have two key roles one is to provide leadership in policymaking and the other is to administer policy programs and projects Economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state regional or municipal level or in public–private partnerships organizations that may be partially funded by local regional state or federal tax money These economic development organizations function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments Their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth There are numerous other organizations whose primary function is not economic development that work in partnership with economic developers They include the news media foundations utilities schools health care providers faithbased organizations and colleges universities and other education or research institutions International Economic Development Council With more than 20000 professional economic developers employed worldwide in this highly specialized industry the International Economic Development Council IEDC headquartered in Washington DC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping economic developers do their job more effectively and raising the profile of the profession With over 4500 members across the US and internationally serving exclusively the economic development community IEDC membership represents the entire range of the profession ranging from regional state local rural urban and international economic development organizations as well as chambers of commerce technology development agencies utility companies educational institutions consultants and redevelopment authorities Many individual states also have associations comprising economic development professionals who work closely with IEDC Development indicators and indices There are various types of macroeconomic and sociocultural indicators or metrics used by economists and geographers to assess the relative economic advancement of a given region or nation The World Banks World Development Indicators are compiled annually from officiallyrecognized international sources and include national regional and global estimates GDP per capita – Growing development population GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by mid year population GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidizes not included in the value of the products It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources Income distribution Literacy and education Literacy and education simply means how well the local people of a certain area have access to education It is the average number of educated people as compared to other countries in the world The ratio of educated population to uneducated people Access to Healthcare Social security and pensions Modern transportation European development economists have argued that the existence of modern transportation networks such as highspeed rail infrastructure constitutes a significant indicator of a country’s economic advancement this perspective is illustrated notably through the Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index known as BRTI Index and related models such as the Modiﬁed Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index RTI Community competition One unintended consequence of economic development is the intense competition between communities states and nations for new economic development projects in todays globalized world With the struggle to attract and retain business competition is further intensified by the use of many variations of economic incentives to the potential business such as tax incentives investment capital donated land utility rate discounts and many others IEDC places significant attention on the various activities undertaken by economic development organizations to help them compete and sustain vibrant communities Additionally the use of community profiling tools and database templates to measure community assets versus other communities is also an important aspect of economic development Job creation economic output and increase in taxable basis are the most common measurement tools When considering measurement too much emphasis has been placed on economic developers for not creating jobs However the reality is that economic developers do not typically create jobs but facilitate the process for existing businesses and startups to do so Therefore the economic developer must make sure that there are sufficient economic development programs in place to assist the businesses achieve their goals Those types of programs are usually policycreated and can be local regional statewide and national in nature See
