 Philip David Phil Radford born January 2 1976 is an American environmental clean energy and democracy leader who served as the youngest Executive Director of Greenpeace USA He is a cofounder of the Democracy Initiative Membership Drive was founder and Executive Director of Power Shift and is a board member of Green Corps and the Mertz Gilmore Foundation He has a background in grassroots organizing corporate social responsibility climate change and clean energy Radford lives in Washington DC with his wife Eileen Radford’s theory of change shifted from viewing governments as arbitrators between public and private interests on environmental issues to finding that most governments are captured by industry Rather than fighting first for new laws which could be blocked by industries he has focused on pressuring large companies to change their practices and enlisted them as allies in pushing for strong environmental protections Examples include Greenpeace campaigns that convinced Apple Inc and similar companies to shift to 100 clean energy and lobby utilities and regulators to make that possible as well as work to protect both the Indonesian rainforest and the Bering Sea Canyons Radford argues that the combination of creating industry champions and “outside pressure” focused on the government are the keys to passing new laws to protect the environment However Radford has also been a vocal leader calling for the United States to pass campaign finance reform and respect all Americans voting rights to shift power in politics from corporations towards people and fulfill the promise of American democracy Radford is considered by many to be a modernday transcendentalist in that he is very focused on nature and the environment and he is an advocate of democracy Early life Radford received his BA from Washington University in St Louis in 1998 Early activism Radford began his environmental activism as a high school student at Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park a Chicago suburb volunteering for an environmental justice campaign to stop the building of trash incinerators in the West Side of Chicago near his familys Oak Park home

mobilization for the Global Warming Divestiture Campaign which resulted in Ford General Motors Texaco and other companies ending their funding the Global Climate Coalition which spread misinformation about global warming According to the New York Times the result of the campaign was “the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming” Founder of Power Shift In 2001 Radford founded Power Shift a nongovernmental organization dedicated to driving clean energy market breakthroughs and building the grassroots base to stop global warming As Executive Director of Power Shift Radford worked closely with the cities of San Diego Chula Vista and Berkeley CA as well as nine other municipalities to secure investments for installation of solar energy systems and

announced that he would step down on April 30 2014 once he had completed five years of service as Executive Director New York Times reporter Andrew Revkin referred to a Greenpeace campaign during Radfords tenure as “Activism at Its Best” Ben Jealous former president and chief executive officer of the NAACP as well as cofounder of the Democracy Initiative with Radford described Radford at the helm of Greenpeace as a modern movement building giant He has built powerful diverse coalitions to bolster the fights for the environment and voting rights In the process he has shown himself to be

EEMs Citi was missing the opportunity to help stop global warming by phasing out fossil fuel investments and promoting clean energy now Radford said The irony is that if Citi financed solar for

installations that would make clean energy affordable for millions of Americans KimberlyClark Radford oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the Kleercut Campaign in the United States and

instead of the clean energy available today” Business Insider reported that after Greenpeace USA campaigns “tech giants like Apple Google Facebook and Salesforce have promised to power their data centers with renewable energy a pledge that led Duke Energy the nations largest power utility and one of the most flagrant emitters of CO2 to begin providing clean energy to win their business”
