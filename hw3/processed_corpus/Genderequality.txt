 Gender equality also known as sex equality gender egalitarianism sexual equality or equality of the genders is the belief that everyone should receive equal treatment and not be discriminated against based on their gender Gender equality is one of the objectives of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights They seek to create equality in law and in social situations such as in democratic activities and securing equal pay for equal work The objective of gender equality is for people of different genders to acquire if they so choose equal treatment throughout a society not just in politics the workplace or any other policydesignated sphere To avoid complication genders besides women and men will not be discussed in this article History Christine de Pizan an early advocate for gender equality states in her 1405 book The Book of the City of Ladies that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women Shakers Further information Shakers The Shakers an evangelical group which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict celibacy were early practitioners of gender equality They branched off from a Quaker community in the northwest of England before emigrating to America in 1774 In America the head of the Shakers central ministry in 1788 Joseph Meacham had a revelation that the sexes should be equal He then brought Lucy Wright into the ministry as his female counterpart and together they restructured society to balance the rights of the sexes Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder who dealt with the mens spiritual welfare was partnered with an eldress who did the same for women Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess Men had oversight of men women had oversight of women Women lived with women men lived with men In Shaker society a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man After Meachams death in 1796 Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821 Shakers maintained the same pattern of genderbalanced leadership for more than 200 years They also promoted equality by working together with other womens rights advocates In 1859 Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully writing that Shakers were the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems more or less consign her and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that by her similarity to him in organization and faculties both God and nature would seem to demand Evans and his counterpart Eldress Antoinette Doolittle joined womens rights advocates on speakers platforms throughout the northeastern US in the 1870s A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875 The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society they put equality of the sexes into practice They demonstrated that equality was achievable and how to achieve it In wider society the movement towards gender equality began with the suffrage movement in Western cultures in the late19th century which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office This period also witnessed significant changes to womens property rights particularly in relation to their marital status See for example Married Womens Property Act 1882 Postwar era Further information Antidiscrimination laws Further information Timeline of womens legal rights other than voting After World War II a more general movement for gender equality developed based on womens liberation and feminism The central issue was that the rights of women should be the same as of men Feminists believe that women should be equal in every aspect to men and deserve the same rights that are given to men The United Nations and other international agencies have adopted several conventions toward the promotion of gender equality Prominent international instruments include In 1960 the Convention against Discrimination in Education was adopted coming into force in 1962 and 1968 The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women CEDAW is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly Described as an international bill of rights for women it came into force on 3 September 1981 The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action a human rights declaration adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 in Vienna Austria Womens rights are addressed at para 18 The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993 In 1994 the twentyyear Cairo Programme of Action was adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development ICPD in Cairo This non binding programmeofaction asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals reproductive needs rather than demographic targets As such it called for family planning reproductive rights services and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women Also in 1994 in the Americas The InterAmerican Convention on the Prevention Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women known as the Convention of Belém do Pará called for the end of violence and discrimination against women At the end of the Fourth World Conference on Women the UN adopted the Beijing Declaration on 15 September 1995 a resolution adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 UNSRC 1325 which was adopted on 31 October 2000 deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after armed conflicts The Maputo Protocol guarantees comprehensive rights to women including the right to take part in the political process to social and political equality with men to control their reproductive health and an end to female genital mutilation It was adopted by the African Union in the form of a protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and came into force in 2005 The EU directive Directive 200273EC equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76207EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment vocational training and promotion and working conditions states that Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited The Council of Europes Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women came into force in 2014 The Council of Europes Gender Equality Strategy 20142017 which has five strategic objectives Such legislation and affirmative action policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least somewhat important and a global median of 65 believe it is very important that women have the same rights as men Most occupations are now equally available to men and women in many countries For example many countries now permit women to serve in the armed forces the police forces and to be fire fighters – occupations traditionally reserved for men Although these continue to have a male majority an increasing number of women are now active especially in directive fields such as politics and occupy high positions in business Similarly men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered womens work such as nursing cleaning and child care In domestic situations the role of Parenting or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role so that women may be free to pursue a career after childbirth For further information see Shared earningshared parenting marriage Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the nonautomatic taking by a woman of her husbands surname on marriage A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in religiously orientated societies For example the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries In some Christian churches the practice of churching of women may still have elements of ritual purification and the Ordination of women to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden Some Christians or Muslims believe in Complementarianism a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality In addition there are also nonWestern countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains In China a cultural preference for a male child has resulted in a shortfall of women in the population The feminist movement in Japan has made many strides which resulted in Rethe Gender Equality Bureau but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations The notion of gender equality and of its degree of achievement in a certain country is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas An example is Finland which has offered very high opportunities to women in publicprofessional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of violence against women with the situation in this country having been called a paradox Denmark received harsh criticism for inadequate laws in regard to sexual violence in a 2008 report produced by Amnesty International which described Danish laws as inconsistent with international human rights standards This led to Denmark reforming its sexual offenses legislation in 2013 Indeed there is a need for caution when categorizing countries by the level of gender equality that they have achieved According to Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon gender policy is not one issue but many and Not all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted For example topfreedom the right to be bare breasted in public frequently applies only to males and has remained a marginal issue Breastfeeding in public is now more commonly tolerated especially in semiprivate places such as restaurants Gender biases There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of progress in gender equality with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men and that official public policies such as sate policies or international bodies policies are questionable as they are applied in a patriarchal context and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies in particular those of the European Union is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in nonWestern countries while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West is a form of imperialism and of reinforcing Western moral superiority and a way of othering of domestic violence by presenting it as something specific to outsiders the violent others and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems such as domestic violence and rape as in other parts of the world They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago for instance in some Western countries such as Switzerland Greece Spain and France women obtained equal rights in family law in the 1980s Another criticism is that there is a selective public discourse with regard to different types of oppression of women with some forms of violence such as honor killings most common in certain geographic regions such as parts of Asia and North Africa being frequently the object of public debate while other forms of violence such as the lenient punishment for crimes of passion across Latin America do not receive the same attention in the West In 2002 Widney Brown advocacy director for Human Rights Watch pointed out that crimes of passion have a similar dynamic to honor killings in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived in those relevant parts of the world as excusable or understandable It is also argued that the criticism of particular laws of many developing countries ignores the influence of colonialism on those legal systems especially of the French Napoleonic Code which was extremely powerful in its influence over the world historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world and which designated married women a subordinate role and provided for leniency with regard to crimes of passion which was the case in France until 1975 Efforts to fight inequality See also Gender inequality World bodies have defined gender equality in terms of human rights especially womens rights and economic development UNICEF describes that gender equality means that women and men and girls and boys enjoy the same rights resources opportunities and protections It does not require that girls and boys or women and men be the same or that they be treated exactly alike UNFPA stated that despite many international agreements affirming their human rights women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate They have less access to property ownership credit training and employment They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence Thus promoting gender equality is seen as an encouragement to greater economic prosperity For example nations of the Arab world that deny equality of opportunity to women were warned in a 2008 United Nationssponsored report that this disempowerment is a critical factor crippling these nations return to the first rank of global leaders in commerce learning and culture That is Western bodies are less likely to conduct commerce with nations in the Middle East that retain culturally accepted attitudes towards the status and function of women in their society in an effort to force them to change their beliefs in the face of relatively underdeveloped economies In 2010 the European Union opened the European Institute for Gender Equality EIGE in Vilnius Lithuania to promote gender equality and to fight sex discrimination Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries Personal Social and Health Education religious studies and Language acquisition curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development To overcome gender inequality the United Nations Population Fund states that Womens empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policymaking These levels include reproductive health economic empowerment educational empowerment and political empowerment UNFPA says that research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes Violence against women Main article Violence against women Violence against women is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women This type of violence is genderbased meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly because they are women or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women defines violence against women as any act of genderbased violence that results in or is likely to result in physical sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women including threats of such acts coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty whether occurring in public or in private life and states that According to some theories violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships Studies on IPV victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a highrisk group for intimate violence Forms of violence against women include sexual violence including war rape marital rape date rape by drugs or alcohol and child sexual abuse the latter often in the context of child marriage domestic violence forced marriage female genital mutilation forced prostitution sex trafficking honor killings dowry killings acid attacks stoning flogging forced sterilization forced abortion violence related to accusations of witchcraft mistreatment of widows eg widow inheritance Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issues for achieving gender equality The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence Istanbul Convention In Western countries which are believed to be overall safe ie where gang murders armed kidnappings civil unrest and other similar acts are rare the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partnersexpartners as of 20042009 former and current partners were responsible for more than 80 of all cases of murders of women in Cyprus France and Portugal By contrast in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere often in a general climate of indifference and impunity In addition many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders aggravating the problem In some parts of the world various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life according to UNFPA In most countries it is only in more recent decades that violence against women in particular when committed in the family has received significant legal attention The Istanbul Convention acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring de jure or de facto this form of violence In its explanatory report at para 219 it states In Opuz v Turkey the European Court of Human Rights recognized violence against women as a form discrimination against women para 200 The Court considers that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother may be regarded as genderbased violence which is a form of discrimination against women This is also the position of the Istanbul Convention which reads In some cultures acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male owners of the woman such as husband father or male relatives rather the woman herself This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the womens family Such practices include payback rape a form of rape specific to certain cultures particularly the Pacific Islands which consists of the rape of a female usually by a group of several males as revenge for acts committed by members of her family such as her father or brothers with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators Reproductive and sexual health and rights Main articles Reproductive health and Reproductive rights Further information Forced sterilization Forced pregnancy and Forced abortion The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body reproduction decisions and sexuality and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and the UN International Conference on Population and Development Program of Action The World Health Organization WHO has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against HIVAIDS Maternal mortality is a major problem in many parts of the world UNFPA states that countries have an obligation to protect womens right to health but many countries do not do that Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of human rights UNFPA says that since 1990 the world has seen a 45 per cent decline in maternal mortality – an enormous achievement But in spite of these gains almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth This is about one woman every two minutes According to UNFPA The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world through practices such as forced sterilization forcedcoerced sexual partnering eg forced marriage child marriage criminalization of consensual sexual acts such as sex outside marriage lack of criminalization of marital rape violence in regard to the choice of partner honor killings as punishment for inappropriate relations Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that It is unbelievable that in the twentyfirst century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion sex outside marriage and samesex sexual activity – even punishable by death These practices infringe on the right of achieving reproductive and sexual health High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has called for full respect and recognition of womens autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights stating Adolescent girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion sexual ill health and negative reproductive outcomes The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity different socialization of boys and girls gender based violence child marriage and partly due to biological factors females risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common according to the WHO Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong where gender roles are more rigid and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a womans right to control her sexuality is not recognized Richard A Posner writes that Traditionally rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wifes chastity or his daughters virginity Historically rape was seen in many cultures and is still seen today in some societies as a crime against the honor of the family rather than against the selfdetermination of the woman As a result victims of rape may face violence in extreme cases even honor killings at the hands of their family members Catharine MacKinnon argues that in male dominated societies sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way creating a continuum of victimization where women have few positive sexual experiences she writes To know what is wrong with rape know what is right about sex If this in turn is difficult the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex and men are seen as entitled to their bodies until and unless women object Rebecca Cook wrote in Submission of Interights to the European Court of Human Rights in the case of MC v Bulgaria 12 April 2003 Freedom of movement Further information Freedom of movement The degree to which women can participate in law and in practice in public life varies by culture historical era social class and other other socioeconomic characteristics Seclusion of women within the home was a common practice among the upper classes of many societies and this still remains the case today in some societies Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe such as much of Spain Womens freedom of movement continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world This restriction is often due to marriage laws For instance in Yemen marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission In some countries women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians such as the husband or male relative when they leave home The CEDAW states at Article 15 4 that In addition to laws womens freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms for example purdah a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as uppercaste Hindus in Northern India such as the Rajputs which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions or namus a cultural concept strongly related to family honor The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women if a wife wants to leave her husband he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the womans family and the womans family often cannot or does not want to pay it back making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands homes Restrictions on freedom of movement also exist due to traditional practices such as baad swara or vani common especially among Pashtun tribes in Pakistan and Afghanistan whereby a girl is given from one family to another often though a marriage in order to settle the disputes and feuds between the families The girl who now belongs to the second family has very little autonomy and freedom her role being to serve the new family Gendered arrangements of work and care Since the 1950s social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role Policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers as a tool of changing gender relations Shared earningshared parenting marriage that is a relationship where the partners collaborate at sharing their responsibilities inside and outside of the home is often encouraged in Western countries Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers rather than a professional role include parts of German speaking Europe parts of Germany Austria and Switzerland as well as the Netherlands and Ireland In 2011 Jose Manuel Barroso then president of the European Commission stated Germany but also Austria and the Netherlands should look at the example of the northern countries that means removing obstacles for women older workers foreigners and lowskilled jobseekers to get into the workforce The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries In the early 1980s the Commission of the European Communities report Women in the European Community found that the Netherlands and Ireland had the lowest labour participation of married women and the most public disapproval of it In Ireland until 1973 there was a marriage bar In the Netherlands from the 1990s onwards the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased but with most of the women working part time As of 2014 the Netherlands and Switzerland were the only OECD members where most employed women worked parttime while in the United Kingdom women made up twothirds of workers on long term sick leave despite making up only half of the workforce and even after excluding maternity leave A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of maternity rights and reproductive rights of women Different countries have different rules regarding maternity leave paternity leave and parental leave In the European Union EU the policies vary significantly by country but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the Pregnant Workers Directive and Parental Leave Directive Another important issue refers to ensuring that employed women are not de jure or de facto prevented from having a child For example some countries have enacted legislation explicitly outlawing or restricting what they view as abusive clauses in employment contracts regarding reproductive rights for example clauses which stipulate that a woman cannot get pregnant during a specified time rendering such contracts void or voidable In some countries employers who request women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant face legal punishment Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers and the International Labour Organization classifies forced abortion coerced by the employer as labour exploitation Being the victim of a forced abortion compelled by the employer was ruled a ground of obtaining political asylum in the US Other abuses include routine virginity tests of unmarried employed women Girls access to education Main articles Female education and Gender and education In many parts of the world girls access to education is very restricted In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles These include early and forced marriages early pregnancy prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home at school and in the community violence on the way to school or in and around schools long distances to schools vulnerability to the HIV epidemic school fees which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms According to OHCHR there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 20092014 with a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education The United Nations Population Fund says Political participation of women Main article Women in government Women are underrepresented in most countries National Parliaments The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women’s political participation called for female participation in politics and expressed concern about the fact that women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere The Council of Europe states that Institutions also play an essential role in achieving and enforcing gender equality However basic legal and human rights access to and the control of resources employment and earnings and social and political participation are still not guaranteed in many social and legal institutions For example only 22 percent of parliamentarians globally are women and therefore men continue to occupy most positions of political and legal authority As of November 2014 women accounted for 28 of members of the single or lower houses of parliaments in the European Union member states In some Western countries women have only recently obtained the right to vote notably in Switzerland where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971 but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991 when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland In Liechtenstein women were given the right to vote by the womens suffrage referendum of 1984 Three prior referendums held in 1968 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure womens right to vote Economic empowerment of women Main articles Women in the workforce Female economic activity and Genderbased price discrimination Female economic activity is a common measure of gender equality in an economy UN Women states that Investing in women’s economic empowerment sets a direct path towards gender equality poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth Gender discrimination often results in women obtaining lowwage jobs and being disproportionately affected by poverty discrimination and exploitation The UN Population Fund says that Six out of 10 of the world’s poorest people are women Economic disparities persist partly because much of the unpaid work within families and communities falls on the shoulders of women and because women continue to face discrimination in the economic sphere Gender biases also exist in product and service provision The term Womens Tax also known as Pink Tax refers to gendered pricing in which products or services marketed to women are more expensive than similar products marketed to men Genderbased price discrimination involves companies selling almost identical units of the same product or service at comparatively different prices as determined by the target market Studies have found that women pay about 1400 a year more than men due to gendered discriminatory pricing Although the pink tax of different goods and services is not uniform overall women pay more for commodities that result in visual evidence of feminine body image For example studies have shown that women are charged more for services especially tailoring hair cutting and laundering A growing body of research documents what works to economically empower women from providing access to formal financial services to training on agricultural and business management practices though more research is needed across a variety of contexts to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions Marriage divorce and property laws and regulations Equal rights for women in marriage divorce and propertyland ownership and inheritance are essential for gender equality CEDAW has called for the end of discriminatory family laws In 2013 UN Women stated that While at least 115 countries recognize equal land rights for women and men effective implementation remains a major challenge The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards John Stuart Mill in The Subjection of Women 1869 compared marriage to slavery and wrote that The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out In 1957 James Everett then Minister for Justice in Ireland stated The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women Until the 1970s legal subordination of married women was common across European countries through marriage laws giving legal authority to the husband as well as through marriage bars In France married women obtained the right to work without their husbands consent in 1965 while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the childrens property In Austria the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983 abolishing the restrictions on married womens right to work outside the home providing for equality between spouses and for joint ownership of property and assets Switzerland was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage in this country married womens rights were severely restricted until 1988 when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage abolishing the legal authority of the husband come into force these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum who narrowly voted in favor with 547 of voters approving In the Netherlands although the legal incapacity of a married woman was abolished in 1956 the marriage bar for women civil servants being lifted in 1957 it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husbands opinion prevailed over the wifes regarding issues such as decisions on childrens education and the domicile of the family In 1978 the Council of Europe passed the Resolution 78 37 on equality of spouses in civil law In the United States a wifes legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of Kirchberg v Feenstra 450 US 455 1981 a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a Louisiana Head and Master law which gave sole control of marital property to the husband unconstitutional There have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life For example in Australia until 1983 a husband had to authorize a passport application for a married woman Other practices have included and in many countries continue to include a requirement for a husbands consent for an application for bank loans and credit cards by a married woman as well as restrictions on the wifes reproductive rights such as a requirement that the husband consents to the wifes acquiring of contraception or having an abortion In some places although the law itself no longer requires the consent of the husband for various actions taken by the wife the practice continues de facto with the authorization of the husband being asked in practice Although dowry is today associated with South Asia the practice has been common until the mid20th century in parts of Southeast Europe For example in Greece dowry was removed from family law only in 1983 through legal changes which reformed marriage law and provided gender equality in marriage These changes also dealt with the practice of women changing their surnames to that of the husbands upon getting married a practice which has been outlawed or restricted in some jurisdictions because it is seen as contrary to womens rights As such women in Greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life Laws regulating marriage and divorce continue to discriminate against women in many countries For example in Yemen marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission In Iraq husbands have a legal right to punish their wives with paragraph 41 of the criminal code stating that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right Examples of legal rights include The punishment of a wife by her husband the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom In the 1990s and the 21st century there has been progress in many countries in Africa for instance in Namibia the marital power of the husband was abolished in 1996 by the Married Persons Equality Act in Botswana it was abolished in 2004 by the Abolition of Marital Power Act and in Lesotho it was abolished in 2006 by the Married Persons Equality Act Violence and mistreatment of women in relation to marriage has come to international attention during the past decades This includes both violence committed inside marriage domestic violence as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions such as dowry bride price forced marriage and child marriage Violence against a wife continues to be seen as legally acceptable in some countries for instance in 2010 the United Arab Emiratess Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks The criminalization of adultery has been criticized as being a prohibition which in law or in practice is used primarily against women and incites violence against women crimes of passion honor killings A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice in 2012 stated the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice is deeply concerned at the criminalization and penalization of adultery whose enforcement leads to discrimination and violence against women UN Women also stated that Drafters should repeal any criminal offenses related to adultery or extramarital sex between consenting adults Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal impunity of perpetrators of crimes against women with such crimes being often ignored by authorities This is especially the case with murders of women in Latin America In particular there is impunity in regard to domestic violence High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has stated on domestic violence against women Women are often in law or in practice unable to access legal institutions UN Women has said that Too often justice institutions including the police and the courts deny women justice Often women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence according to Amnesty International Women who are victims of genderrelated violence often have little recourse because many state agencies are themselves guilty of gender bias and discriminatory practices Gender stereotypes Further information Gender role Gender stereotypes arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere at home or in the workplaceIn the household women are typically seen as mother figures which usually places them into a typical classification of being supportive or nurturing Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs Their male counterparts are seen as being assertive or ambitious as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family Due to these views and expectations women often face discrimination in the public sphere such as the workplace A gender role is a set of societal norms dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable appropriate or desirable for people based on their sex Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of femininity and masculinity although there are exceptions and variations The Istanbul Convention contains a definition of gender stating that “gender” shall mean the socially constructed roles behaviours activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men Article 3–Definitions c Harmful traditional practices Harmful traditional practices refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice and accepted for that reason Young women are the main victims of such acts although men can be affected They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities These practices include according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Female genital mutilation is defined as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist Of these about half live in two countries Egypt and Ethiopia It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old UNFPA and UNICEF state that In every society where it is practiced FGM is a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality It persists for many reasons In some societies for example it is considered a rite of passage In others it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage In some communities whether Christian Jewish Muslim the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs Because FGM may be considered an important part of a culture or identity it can be difficult for families to decide against having their daughters cut People who reject the practice may face condemnation or ostracism Even parents who do not want their daughters to undergo FGM may feel compelled to participate in the practice Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters and manifests

Asia and Africa The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23 Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girls education and development and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse The 2013 UN Resolution on Child Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice and states that Recognizing that child early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls Despite a nearuniversal commitment by governments to end child marriage one in three girls in developing countries excluding China will probably be married before they are 18 UNFPA states that over 67 million women 2024 year old in 2010 had been married as girls Half were in Asia onefifth in Africa In the next decade 142 million girls under 18 will be married every year this

regard to certain foods which result in poor nutrition of women and may endanger their health especially if pregnant Womens ability to control their fertility is often reduced For instance in northern Ghana the payment of bride price signifies a womans requirement to bear children and women using birth control face threats violence and reprisals Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants TBAs who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother In many societies a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity and such women face abuse and are pressured to confess to the infidelity The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages UN Women recommended its abolition and stated that Legislation should State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce State that a perpetrator of domestic violence including marital rape cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge The caste system in India which leads to untouchability the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society often interacts with gender discrimination leading to a double discrimination faced by Dalit women In a 2014 survey 27 of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability Tribal traditions can be harmful to males for instance the SatereMawe tribe use bullet ants as an initiation rite Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes the ants stings cause severe pain and paralysis This experience must

inheritance Portrayal of women in the media Main article Exploitation of women in mass media The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as interfering with the aim of achieving gender equality by perpetuating negative gender stereotypes The exploitation of women in mass media refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the mass media when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product to the detriment of or without regard to the interests of the women portrayed or women in general Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the populations perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions that falsely implies that women are unimportant or invisible Criticisms of the way women are represented in the media is that the media reinforces stereotypical societal views of what women are for by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women According to a study the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder anorexia bulimia and so on The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls development Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated they want to be slimmer StriegelMoore Franko 2002 Health Further information Gender disparities in health Social constructs of gender that is cultural ideals of socially acceptable masculinity and femininity often have a negative effect on health The WHO cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home to go to the hospital and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity as social norms that harm womens health Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through risk taking and men dying at much higher rate from lung cancer due to smoking in cultures which link smoking to masculinity are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting mens health The WHO has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of HIVAIDS Informing women of their rights While in many countries the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with womens rights are of recent date This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims explicitly or implicitly to believe that their abuse is within their rights This may apply to a wide range of abuses ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination The United Nations Development Programme states that in order to advance gender justice Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems The 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art 4 d States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms Enacting protective legislation against violence has little effect if women do not know how to use it for example a study of Bedouin women in Israel found that 60 did not know what a restraining order was or if they dont know what acts are illegal a report by Amnesty International showed in Hungary in a public opinion poll of nearly 1200 people in 2006 a total of 62 did not know that marital rape was an illegal it was outlawed in 1997 and therefore the crime was rarely reported Ensuring women have a minim understanding of health issues is also important lack of access to reliable medical information and available medical procedures to which they are entitled hurts womens health Gender mainstreaming Main article Gender mainstreaming Gender mainstreaming is described as the public policy of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned policy action including legislation and programmes in all areas and levels with the aim of achieving gender equality The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi Kenya The idea has been developed in the United Nations development community Gender mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities According to the Council of Europe definition Gender mainstreaming is the reorganization improvement development and evaluation of policy processes so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages by the actors normally involved in policymaking An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and genderequality aspirations to advance human rights For example in Azerbaijan UNFPA conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice The study showcased specific issues including VAW child marriage respect for the dignity of women and equality in the economic and political participation of women The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders See also Gender studies portal General issues Coloniality of gender Special Measures for
