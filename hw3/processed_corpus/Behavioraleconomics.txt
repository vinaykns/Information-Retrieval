 Behavioral economics studies the effects of psychological social cognitive and emotional factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions and the consequences for market prices returns and resource allocation although not always that narrowly but also more generally of the impact of different kinds of behavior in different environments of varying experimental values Risk tolerance is a crucial factor in personal financial decision making Risk tolerance is defined as individuals willingness to engage in a financial activity whose outcome is uncertain Behavioral economics is primarily concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents Behavioral models typically integrate insights from psychology neuroscience and microeconomic theory in so doing these behavioral models cover a range of concepts methods and fields The study of behavioral economics includes how market decisions are made and the mechanisms that drive public choice The use of the term behavioral economics in US scholarly papers has increased in the past few years as shown by a recent study There are three prevalent themes in behavioral finances Heuristics People often make decisions based on approximate rules of thumb and not strict logic Framing The collection of anecdotes and stereotypes that make up the mental emotional filters individuals rely on to understand and respond to events Market inefficiencies These include mispricings and nonrational decision making History During the classical period of economics microeconomics was closely linked to psychology For example Adam Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior including concerns about fairness and justice and Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of utility However during the development of neoclassical economics economists sought to reshape the discipline as a natural science deducing economic behavior from assumptions about the nature of economic agents They developed the concept of homo economicus whose psychology was fundamentally rational However many important neoclassical economists employed more sophisticated psychological explanations including Francis Edgeworth Vilfredo Pareto and Irving Fisher Economic psychology emerged in the 20th century in the works of Gabriel Tarde George Katona and Laszlo Garai Expected utility and discounted utility models began to gain acceptance generating testable hypotheses about decisionmaking given uncertainty and intertemporal consumption respectively Observed and repeatable anomalies eventually challenged those hypotheses and further steps were taken by the Nobel Prizewinner Maurice Allais for example in setting out the Allais paradox a decision problem he first presented in 1953 that contradicts the expected utility hypothesis In the 1960s cognitive psychology began to shed more light on the brain as an information processing device in contrast to behaviorist models Psychologists in this field such as Ward Edwards Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began to compare their cognitive models of decisionmaking under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behavior In mathematical psychology there is a longstanding interest in the transitivity of preference and what kind of measurement scale utility constitutes Prospect theory In 1979 Kahneman and Tversky wrote Prospect Theory An Analysis of Decision Under Risk an important paper that used cognitive psychology to explain various divergences of economic decision making from neoclassical theory Prospect theory has two stages an editing stage and an evaluation stage In the editing stage risky situations are simplified using various heuristics of choice In the evaluation phase risky alternatives are evaluated using various psychological principles that include the following 1 Reference dependence When evaluating outcomes the decision maker has in mind a reference level Outcomes are then compared to the reference point and classified as gains if greater than the reference point and losses if less than the reference point 2 Loss aversion Losses bite more than equivalent gains In their 1979 paper published in Econometrica Kahneman and Tversky found the median coefficient of loss aversion to be about 225 ie losses bite about 225 times more than equivalent gains 3 Nonlinear probability weighting Evidence indicates that decision makers overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities—this gives rise to the inverseS shaped probability weighting function 4 Diminishing sensitivity to gains and losses As the size of the gains and losses relative to the reference point increase in absolute value the marginal effect on the decision makers utility or satisfaction falls Prospect theory is able to explain everything that the two main existing decision theories—expected utility theory and rank dependent utility theory—can explain However the converse is false Prospect theory has been used to explain a range of phenomena that existing decision theories have great difficulty in explaining These include backward bending labor supply curves asymmetric price elasticities tax evasion comovement of stock prices and consumption etc In 1992 in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty Kahneman and Tversky gave their revised account of prospect theory that they called cumulative prospect theory The new theory eliminated the editing phase in prospect theory and focused just on the evaluation phase Its main feature was that it allowed for nonlinear probability weighting in a cumulative manner which was originally suggested in John Quiggins rank dependent utility theory Psychological traits such as overconfidence projection bias and the effects of limited attention are now part of the theory Other developments include a conference at the University of Chicago a special behavioral economics edition of the Quarterly Journal of Economics In Memory of Amos Tversky and Kahnemans 2002 Nobel Prize for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science especially concerning human judgment and decisionmaking under uncertainty Intertemporal choice See also Time inconsistency Behavioral economics has also been applied to intertemporal choice Intertemporal choice is defined as making a decision and having the effects of such decision happening in a different time Intertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent as exemplified by George Ainslies hyperbolic discounting—one of the prominently studied observations—and further developed by David Laibson Ted ODonoghue and Matthew Rabin Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency to discount outcomes in the near future more than for outcomes in the far future This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent or timeinconsistent and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice since the rate of discount between time t and t1 will be low at time t1 when t is the near future but high at time t when t is the present and time t1 is the near future The pattern can also be explained through models of subadditive discounting that distinguish the delay and interval of discounting people are less patient pertimeunit over shorter intervals regardless of when they occur Other areas of research Other branches of behavioral economics enrich the model of the utility function without implying inconsistency in preferences Ernst Fehr Armin Falk and Matthew Rabin studied fairness inequity aversion and reciprocal altruism weakening the neoclassical assumption of perfect selfishness This work is particularly applicable to wage setting The work on intrinsic motivation by Gneezy and Rustichini and identity by Akerlof and Kranton assumes that agents derive utility from adopting personal and social norms in addition to conditional expected utility According to Aggarwal in addition to behavioral deviations from rational equilibrium markets are also likely to suffer from lagged responses search costs externalities of the commons and other frictions making it difficult to disentangle behavioral effects in market behavior Conditional expected utility is a form of reasoning where the individual has an illusion of control and calculates the probabilities of external events and hence their utility as a function of their own action even when they have no causal ability to affect those external events Behavioral economics caught on among the general public with the success of books such as Dan Arielys Predictably Irrational Practitioners of the discipline have studied quasipublic policy topics such as broadband mapping Taxation from a behavioral economics viewpoint is illustrated in the book The Darwin Economy by Robert H Frank where he invokes the concept of positional consumption vs nonpositional consumption Positional consumption is the consumption we do that is relative to other people while nonpositional consumption is absolute Good houses and good schools are essentially positional and savings for retirement are essentially nonpositional Frank argues that since most of our consumption is positional tax policies must reflect it and that its not possible to form coherent societies without some form of progressive taxation Criticism Critics of behavioral economics typically stress the rationality of economic agents They contend that experimentally observed behavior has limited application to market situations as learning opportunities and competition ensure at least a close approximation of rational behavior Others note that cognitive theories such as prospect theory are models of decision making not generalized economic behavior and are only applicable to the sort of onceoff decision problems presented to experiment participants or survey respondents A notable concern is that despite a great deal of rhetoric there is no real consistent behavioral theory yet Behavioral economics scholars also have no unified theory Until that happens it is a collection of loosely related or unrelated observations What is missing is a foundational behavioral theory that can be tested in many domains as a competitor to neoclassical theory Traditional economists are also skeptical of the experimental and surveybased techniques which behavioral economics uses extensively Economists typically stress revealed preferences over stated preferences from surveys in the determination of economic value Experiments and surveys are at risk of systemic biases strategic behavior and lack of incentive compatibility Responses Rabin dismisses these criticisms claiming that consistent results are typically obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight Behavioral economists have also responded to these criticisms by focusing on field studies rather than lab experiments Some economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and behavioral economics but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions For example behavioral economists are investigating neuroeconomics which is entirely experimental and cannot yet be verified in the field Other proponents of behavioral economics note that neoclassical models often fail to predict outcomes in real world contexts Behavioral insights can influence neoclassical models Behavioral economists note that these revised models not only reach the same correct predictions as the traditional models but also correctly predict some outcomes where the traditional models failed According to some researchers when studying the mechanisms that form the basis of decisionmaking especially financial decisionmaking it is necessary to recognize that most decisions are made under stress because Stress is the nonspecific body response to any demands presented to it From a biological point of view human behaviors are essentially the same during crises accompanied by stock market crashes and during bubble growth when share prices exceed historic highs During those periods most market participants see something new for themselves and this inevitably induces a stress response in them with accompanying changes in their endocrine profiles and motivations The result is quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior However this is only one example of where behavior affecting economics and finance can be observed and variablycontrasted using behavioral economics and it is a mistake to think of its usefulness as only applying within such environments testedin or of conditions similar to stock exchanges specifically Also often selfishreasoning adult behaviors and similar can be identified within criminalconcealments and legaldeficiencies and neglect of different types can be observed and discovered Awareness of indirect consequence or lack of at least in potential with different experimental models and methods can be used as well—behavioral economics potential uses are broad but its reliability need scrutiny An underestimation of the role of novelty as a stressor is the primary shortcoming of current approaches for market research So it is necessary to account for the biologically determined diphasisms of human behavior in everyday lowstress conditions and in response to stressors Applied issues Behavioral Economics The central issue in behavioral Economics is explaining why market participants make irrational systematic errors contrary to assumption of rational market participants Such errors affect prices and returns creating market inefficiencies The study of behavioral Economics also investigates how other participants take advantage arbitrage of such errors and market inefficiencies Behavioral Economics highlights inefficiencies such as under or overreactions to information as causes of market trends and in extreme cases of bubbles and crashes Such reactions have been attributed to limited investor attention overconfidence overoptimism mimicry herding instinct and noise trading Technical analysts consider behavioral Economics to be behavioral economics academic cousin and the theoretical basis for technical analysis Other key observations include the asymmetry between decisions to acquire or keep resources known as the bird in the bush paradox and loss aversion the unwillingness to let go of a valued possession Loss aversion appears to manifest itself in investor behavior as a reluctance to sell shares or other equity if doing so would result in a nominal loss It may also help explain why housing prices rarelyslowly decline to market clearing levels during periods of low demand Benartzi and Thaler applying a version of prospect theory claim to have solved the equity premium puzzle something conventional finance models so far have been unable to do Experimental finance applies the experimental method eg creating an artificial market through some kind of simulation software to study peoples decisionmaking process and behavior in financial markets Quantitative behavioral Economics Quantitative behavioral Economics uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases In marketing research a study shows little evidence that escalating biases impact marketing decisions Leading contributors include Gunduz Caginalp Editor of the Journal of Behavioral Economics from 2001–04 and collaborators include 2002 Nobel Laureate Vernon Smith David Porter Don Balenovich Vladimira Ilieva and Ahmet Duran and Ray Sturm Financial models Some financial models used in money management and asset valuation incorporate behavioral finance parameters Examples Thalers model of price reactions to information with three phases underreaction adjustment and overreaction creating a price trend The stock image coefficient Criticisms Critics such as Eugene Fama typically support the efficientmarket hypothesis They contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies are either quickly priced out of the market or explained by appealing to market microstructure arguments However individual cognitive biases are distinct from social biases the former can be averaged out by the market while the other can create positive feedback loops that drive the market further and further from a fair price equilibrium Similarly for an anomaly to violate market efficiency an investor must be able to trade against it and earn abnormal profits this is not the case for many anomalies A specific example of this criticism appears in some explanations of the equity premium puzzle It is argued that the cause is entry barriers both practical and psychological and that returns between stocks and bonds should equalize as electronic resources open up the stock market to more traders In response others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds minimizing the effect of these putative entry barriers In addition professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials Game theory Main article Behavioral game theory Behavioral game theory Invented by Colin Camerer analyzes interactive strategic decisions and behavior using the methods of game theory experimental economics and experimental psychology Experiments include testing deviations from typical simplifications of economic theory such as the independence axiom and neglect of altruism fairness and framing effects On the positive side the method has been applied to interactive learning Ho Teck H 2008 Individual learning in games  in Palgrave and social preferences As a research program the subject is a development of the last three decades Economic reasoning in nonhuman animals A handful of comparative psychologists have attempted to demonstrate quasieconomic reasoning in nonhuman animals Early attempts along these lines focus on the behavior of rats and pigeons These studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentallytractable nonhuman animals They are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner Methodological similarities aside early researchers in nonhuman economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminology Although such studies are set up primarily in an operant conditioning chamber using food rewards for peckingbarpressing behavior the researchers describe pecking and barpressing not in terms of reinforcement and stimulusresponse relationships but instead in terms of work demand budget and labor Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach taking a more evolutionary perspective comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of nonhuman primate the capuchin monkey Nonhuman animal studies Many early studies of nonhuman economic reasoning were performed on rats and pigeons in an operant conditioning chamber These studies looked at things like peck rate in the case of the pigeon and barpressing rate in the case of the rat given certain conditions of reward Early researchers claim for example that response pattern peckingbarpressing rate is an appropriate analogy to human labor supply Researchers in this field advocate for the appropriateness of using animal economic behavior to understand the elementary components of human economic behavior In a paper by Battalio Green and Kagel they write Labor supply The typical laboratory environment to study labor supply in pigeons is set up as follows Pigeons are first deprived of food Since the animals become hungry food becomes highly desired The pigeons are then placed in an operant conditioning chamber and through orienting and exploring the environment of the chamber they discover that by pecking a small disk located on one side of the chamber food is delivered to them In effect pecking behavior becomes reinforced as it is associated with food Before long the pigeon pecks at the disk or stimulus regularly In this circumstance the pigeon is said to work for the food by pecking The food then is thought of as the currency The value of the currency can be adjusted in several ways including the amount of food delivered the rate of food delivery and the type of food delivered some foods are more desirable than others Economic behavior similar to that observed in humans is discovered when the hungry pigeons stop workingwork less when the reward is reduced Researchers argue that this is similar to labor supply behavior in humans That is like humans who even in need will only work so much for a given wage the pigeons demonstrate decreases in pecking work when the reward value is reduced Demand In human economics a typical demand curve has negative slope This means that as the price of a certain good increases the amount that consumers are willing and able to purchase decreases Researchers studying the demand curves of nonhuman animals such as rats also find downward slopes Researchers have studied demand in rats in a manner distinct from studying labor supply in pigeons Specifically in an operant conditioning chamber containing rats as experimental subjects we require them to press a bar instead of pecking a small disk to receive a reward The reward can be food reward pellets water or a commodity drink such as cherry cola Unlike in previous pigeon studies where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was reward the work analog in this experiment is barpressing Under these circumstances the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing the price of a commodity item in human economics In effect results of demand studies in nonhuman animals show that as the barpressing requirement cost increases the number of times an animal presses the bar equal to or greater than the barpressing requirement payment decreases Evolutionary psychology See also Evolutionary economics An evolutionary psychology perspective states that many of the perceived limitations in rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one Thus when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may result in death it may have been rational to place a greater value on preventing losses than on obtaining gains It may also explain behavioral differences between groups such as males being less riskaverse than females since males have more variable reproductive success than females While unsuccessful riskseeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes males may potentially increase their reproductive success from successful riskseeking much more than females can Notable theorists Economics Uri Gneezy Douglas Bernheim John A List Colin Camerer Ernst Fehr Simon Gächter Armin Falk
