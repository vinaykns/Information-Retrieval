 See also World energy resources and Worldwide energy supply World energy consumption is the total energy used by all of human civilization Typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanitys endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country It does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented Being the power source metric of civilization World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanitys socialeconomicpolitical sphere Institutions such as the International Energy Agency IEA the US Energy Information Administration EIA and the European Environment Agency record and publish energy data periodically Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions The IEA estimates that in 2013 total world energy consumption was 9301 Mtoe or 389 × 10 joules equal to an average power consumption of 123 terawatts From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydro power and renewable energy Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period which can possibly be explained by an increase in international investment in renewable energy The demand for nuclear energy decreased possibly due to the accidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island In 2011 expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion USD or about 10 of the world gross domestic product GDP Europe spends close to onequarter of the worlds energy expenditures North America close to 20 and Japan 6 Overview Further information Total primary energy supply Energy supply consumption and electricity World total primary energy supply TPES or primary energy differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers For instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the worlds primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity In 2012 world primary energy supply amounted to 155505 terawatthour TWh or 13371 Mtoe while the world final energy consumption was 104426 TWh or about 32 less than the total supply World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel This nonenergy use amounted to 9404 TWh 809 Mtoe in 2012 The worlds electricity consumption was 18608 TWh in 2012 This figure is about 18 smaller than the generated electricity due to grid losses storage losses and selfconsumption from power plants gross generation Cogeneration CHP power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes The United States Energy Information Administration regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources The most recent estimate of the world energy consumption was 567 × 10 joules or 157481 TWh in 2013 According to the IEA the total world energy consumption was 143851 TWh in 2008 133602 TWh in 2005 117687 TWh in 2000 and 102569 TWh in 1990 Total world electricity consumption was 19504 TWh in 2013 16503 TWh in 2008 15105 TWh in 2005 and 12116 TWh in 2000 In 2012 approximately 22 of world energy was consumed in North America 5 was consumed South and Central America 23 was consumed in Europe and Eurasia 3 was consumed in Africa and 40 was consumed in the Asia Pacific region In 2013 world energy consumption by power source was oil 311 coal 289 natural gas 214 biofuels and waste 102 nuclear 48 hydro 24 and other solar wind geothermal heat etc 12 Oil coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programmes World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history with a consumption increase of 1765 million tonnes of oil During this period oil coal and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period Trends The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2 in 2011 after the strong increase of 2010 The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth For several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption According to IEA data from 1990 to 2008 the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27 Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008 the Middle East increased by 170 China by 146 India by 91 Africa by 70 Latin America by 66 the USA by 20 the EU27 block by 7 and world overall grew by 39 In 2008 total worldwide energy consumption was 132000 terawatthours TWh or 474 exajoules EJ This corresponds to an average global power demand of 15 terawatts TW In 2012 energy demand increased to 158000 TWh 567 EJ equivalent to an average power use of 180 TW Energy consumption in the G20 increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009 In 2009 world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 11 or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent Mtoe as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world GDP by 06 in 2009 This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in Asia 4 Conversely in OECD consumption was severely cut by 47 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels In North America Europe and the CIS consumptions shrank by 45 5 and 85 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity China became the worlds largest energy consumer 18 of the total since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009 up from 4 in 2008 Oil remained the largest energy source 33 despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time Coal posted a growing role in the worlds energy consumption in 2009 it accounted for 27 of the total Most energy is used in the country of origin since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials In 2008 the share export of the total energy production by fuel was oil 50 19523941 Mt gas 25 8003149 bcm and hard coal 14 7935845 Mt Most of the worlds high energy resources are from the conversion of the suns rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy some is directly or indirectly usable for example via solar PVthermal wind hydro or wave power The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter see solar constant though it fluctuates by about 69 during the year due to the Earths varying distance from the sun This value after multiplication by the crosssectional area intercepted by the Earth is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet about half 89000 TW reaches the Earths surface The estimates of remaining nonrenewable worldwide energy resources vary with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 04  yottajoule YJ or 4 × 10 joules and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium exceeding 25 YJ Fossil fuels range from 06 to 3 YJ if estimates of reserves of methane clathrates are accurate and become technically extractable The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 55 YJ per year though not all of this is available for human consumption The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of 48 trillion and credible policy frameworks According to IEA 2012 the goal of limiting warming to 2 °C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes If action is not taken before 2017 CO2 emissions would be lockedin by energy infrastructure existing in 2017 Fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix supported by 523 billion subsidies in 2011 up almost 30 on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables Emissions Global warming emissions resulting from energy production are an environmental problem Efforts to resolve this include the Kyoto Protocol which is a UN agreement aiming to reduce harmful climate impacts which a number of nations have signed Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius thought to be a risk by the SEI is now doubtful To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75 decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050 if the population is 10 billion in 2050 Across 40 years this averages to a 2 decrease every year In 2011 the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem Hypothetically according to Robert Engelman Worldwatch institute in order to prevent collapse human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population 2009 Greenhouse gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption Large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides SOx nitrous oxides NOx and particulate matter PM are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution Biomass combustion is a major contributor even though it is typically counted as renewable in energy statistics In addition to producing air pollution like fossil fuel combustion most biomass has high CO2 emissions By source Fossil fuels Main article Fossil fuel The twentieth century saw a rapid twentyfold increase in the use of fossil fuels Between 1980 and 2006 the worldwide annual growth rate was 2 According to the US Energy Information Administrations 2006 estimate the estimated 4718 EJ total consumption in 2004 was divided as given in the table above with fossil fuels supplying 86 of the worlds energy Coal Main article Coal In 2000 China accounted for 28 of world coal consumption other Asia consumed 19 North America 25 and the EU 14 The single greatest coalconsuming country is China Its share of the world coal production was 28 in 2000 and rose to 48 in 2009 In contrast to Chinas 70 increase in coal consumption world coal use increased 48 from 2000 to 2009 In practice the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia Chinas energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector the majority of which comes from coal consumption World annual coal production increased 1905 Mt or 32 in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005 of which over 70 was in China and 8 in India Coal production was in 2011 7783 Mt and 2009 6903 Mt equal to 127 production increase in two years If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008 proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe Coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world According to IEA Coal Information 2007 world production and use of coal have increased considerably in recent years According to James Hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO2 emissions from coal Indonesia and Australia exported together 571 of the world coal export in 2011 China Japan South Korea India and Taiwan had 65 share of all the world coal import in 2011 Oil Main article Petroleum Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century With the advent of the automobile aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity oil became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973 After the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel there was a shift away from oil Coal natural gas and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency In the US the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon Japan which bore the brunt of the oil shocks made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world From 1965 to 2008 the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased From 2003 to 2008 coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present Natural Gas Main article Natural Gas In 2009 the world use of natural gas grew 31 compared to 2000 66 of this growth was outside EU North America Latin America and Russia Others include the Middle East Asia and Africa The gas supply increased also in the previous regions 86 in the EU and 16 in the North America 2000–2009 Nuclear power Main article Nuclear Power As of 1 July 2016 the world had 444 operable gridelectric nuclear power reactors with 62 others under construction Since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid 1950s 2008 was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid although two were connected in 2009 Annual generation of nuclear power has been on a slight downward trend since 2007 decreasing 18 in 2009 to 2558 TWh and another 16 in 2011 to 2518 TWh despite increases in production from most countries worldwide because those increases were more than offset by decreases in Germany and Japan Nuclear power met 117 of the worlds electricity demand in 2011 Source IEAOECD Renewable energy Main articles Renewable energy and Renewable energy commercialization Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources that are not significantly depleted by their use such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat Renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas electricity generation hot waterspace heating motor fuels and rural offgrid energy services Based on REN21s 2014 report renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013 respectively This energy consumption is divided as 9 coming from traditional biomass 42 as heat energy nonbiomass 38 hydro electricity and 2 electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US214 billion in 2013 with countries like China and the United States heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power At the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond The following table shows increasing nameplate capacity and has capacity factors that range from 11 for solar to 40 for hydropower From 2000 to 2013 the total renewable energy use has increased 6450 TWh and total energy use 40500 TWh Hydro Main articles Hydroelectricity and Hydropower Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower the production of electrical power through the use of the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water In 2015 hydropower generated 166 of the worlds total electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between 2003 and 2009 Hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the AsiaPacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 China is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 2600 PJ 721 TWh of production in 2010 representing around 17 of domestic electricity use There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW the Three Gorges Dam in China Itaipu Dam in Brazil and Guri Dam in Venezuela Marine energy Main article Ocean energy Marine energy also known as ocean energy and marine and hydrokinetic energy MHK includes tidal and wave power and is a relatively new sector of renewable energy with most projects still in the pilot phase but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4–18 million tonne of oil equivalent toe MHK development in US and international waters includes projects using devices such as wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas instream turbines in fastmoving rivers ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents and ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters Wind Main articles Wind power and Wind power by country Wind power is growing at the rate of 17 annually with a worldwide installed capacity of 432883 megawatts MW at the end of 2015 and is widely used in Europe Asia and the United States Several countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration such as 21 of stationary electricity production in Denmark 18 in Portugal 16 in Spain 14 in Ireland and 9 in Germany in 2010 As of 2011 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis In 2013 wind generated almost 3 of the worlds total electricity Solar Main articles Solar energy and Solar power Solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of everevolving technologies Solar energy technologies include solar heating solar photovoltaics concentrated solar power and solar architecture which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces The International Energy Agency projected that solar power could provide a third of the global final energy demand after 2060 while CO2 emissions would be reduced to very low levels Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air Geothermal Main articles Geothermal energy and Geothermal power Geothermal energy is used commercially in over 70 countries In 2004 200 petajoules 56 TWh of electricity was generated from geothermal resources and an additional 270 petajoules 75 TWh of geothermal energy was used directly mostly for space heating In 2007 the world had a global capacity for 7010100000000000000♠10 GW of electricity generation and an additional 7010280000000000000♠28 GW of direct heating including extraction by geothermal heat pumps Heat pumps are small and widely distributed so estimates of their total capacity are uncertain and range up to 7011100000000000000♠100 GW Bio energy Main articles Biomass Biogas and Biofuel Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply Electricity produced from biomass sources was estimated at 44 GW for 2005 Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100 in Germany Hungary the Netherlands Poland and Spain A further 220 GW was used for heating in 2004 bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264 GW The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded World production of bioethanol increased by 8 in 2005 to reach 33 gigalitres 87×10 US gal with most of the increase in the United States bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil Biodiesel increased by 85 to 39 gigalitres 10×10 US gal making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005 Over 50 is produced in Germany By country Main article List of renewable energy topics by country See also Energy by country Worldwide energy supply and List of countries by energy consumption per capita Energy consumption is loosely correlated with gross national product and climate but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6 kW per person and the United States with an energy consumption rate of 114 kW per person In developing countries particularly those that are subtropical or tropical such as India the per person energy use rate is closer to 07 kW Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 02 kW per person The US consumes 25 of the worlds energy with a share of global GDP at 22 and a share of the world population at 459 The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China which has been growing at 55 per year over the last 25 years Its population of 13 billion people 196 of the world population is consuming energy at a rate of 16 kW per person One measurement of efficiency is energy intensity This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product Oil Saudi Arabia Russia and the United States accounted for 34 of oil production in 2011 Saudi Arabia Russia and Nigeria accounted for 36 of oil export in 2011 Coal Natural gas Wind power By sector Industrial users agriculture mining manufacturing and construction consume about 37 of the total 15 TW Personal and commercial transportation consumes 20 residential heating lighting and appliances use 11 and commercial uses lighting heating and cooling of commercial buildings and provision of water and sewer services amount to 5 of the total The other 27 of the worlds energy is lost in energy transmission and generation In 2005 global electricity consumption averaged 2 TW The energy rate used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38 The new generation of gasfired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55 Coal is the most common fuel for the worlds electricity plants Total world energy use per sector was in 2008 industry 28 transport 27 and residential and service 36 Division was about the same in the year 2000 European Union The European Environmental Agency EEA measures final energy consumption does not include energy used in production and lost in transportation and finds that the transport sector is responsible for 318 of final energy consumption households 262 industry 256 services 135 and agriculture 29 in 2012 The use of energy is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions 79 with the energy sector representing 31 transport 19 industry 13 households 9 and others 7 While efficient energy use and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues more than 70 of coal plants in the European Union are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40 Technological developments in the 1990s have allowed efficiencies in the range of 40–45 at newer plants However according to an impact assessment by the European Commission this is still below the best available technological BAT efficiency levels of 46–49 With gasfired power plants the average efficiency is 52 compared to 58–59 with best available technology BAT and gas and oil boiler plants operate at average 36 efficiency BAT delivers 47 According to that same impact assessment by the European Commission raising the efficiency of all new plants and the majority of existing plants through the setting of authorisation and permit conditions to an average generation efficiency of 515 in 2020 would lead to a reduction in annual consumption of 15 km 36 cu mi of natural gas
