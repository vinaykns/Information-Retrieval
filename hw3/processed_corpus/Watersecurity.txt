 Water security has been defined as the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihoods and production coupled with an acceptable level of waterrelated risks Sustainable development will not be achieved without a water secure world A water secure world integrates a concern for the intrinsic value of water with a concern for its use for human survival and wellbeing A water secure world harnesses waters productive power and minimises its destructive force Water security also means addressing environmental protection and the negative effects of poor management It is also concerned with ending fragmented responsibility for water and integrating water resources management across all sectors—finance planning agriculture energy tourism industry education and health A water secure world reduces poverty advances education and increases living standards It is a world where there is an improved quality of life for all especially for the most vulnerable—usually women and children—who benefit most from good water governance Background According to the Pacific Institute While regional impacts will vary global climate change will potentially alter agricultural productivity freshwater availability and quality access to vital minerals coastal and island flooding and more Among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships realignment of energy markets and regional economies and threats to security It impacts regions states and countries Tensions exist between upstream and downstream users of water within individual jurisdictions During history there has been much conflict over use of water from rivers such as the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers Another highly politicized example is Israels control of water resources in the Levant region since its creation where Israel securing its water resources was one of several drivers for the 1967 Six Day War Water security is sometimes sought by implementing water desalination pipelines between sources and users water licences with different security levels and war Water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of marketbased pricing for either water licenses or actual water Fresh water Water in absolute terms is not in short supply planetwide But according to the United Nations water organization UNWater the total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans is only about 200000 km3 of water – less than one percent 1 of all freshwater resources Usable fresh water includes water not contaminated or degraded by wateraltering chemicals such as sewage or any other harmful chemicals from continuous previous use And water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase in the last century Specifically water withdrawals are predicted to increase by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries and 18 per cent in developed countries One continent for example Africa has been predicted to have 75 to 250 million lacking access to fresh water By 2025 18 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity and twothirds of the world population could be under stress conditions Research According to Nature 2010 about 80 of the worlds population 56 billion in 2011 live in areas with threats to water security The water security is a shared threat to human and nature and it is pandemic Human watermanagement strategies can be detrimental to wildlife such as migrating fish Regions with intensive agriculture and dense populations such as the US and Europe have a high threat of water security Water is increasingly being used as a weapon in conflict Water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty war and conflict low women’s development and environmental degradation Researchers estimate that during 20102015 ca US800 billion will be required to cover the annual global investment in water infrastructure Good management of water resources can jointly manage biodiversity protection and human water security Preserving flood plains rather than constructing floodcontrol reservoirs would provide a costeffective way to control floods while protecting the biodiversity of wildlife that occupies such areas Lawrence Smith the president of the population institute asserts that although an overwhelming majority of the planets surface is composed of water 97 of this water is constituted of saltwater the fresh water used to sustain humans is only 3 of the total amount of water on Earth Therefore Smith believes that the competition for water in an overpopulated world would pose a major threat to human stability even going so far as to postulate apocalyptic world wars being fought over the control of thinning ice sheets and nearly desiccated reservoirs Nevertheless 2 billion people have supposedly gained access to a safe water source since 1990 who may have earlier lacked it The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 percent in 1970 to 71 percent in 1990 79 percent in 2000 and 84 percent in 2004 parallel with rising population This trend is projected to continue The Earth has a limited though renewable supply of fresh water stored in aquifers surface waters and the atmosphere Oceans are a good source of usable water but the amount of energy needed to convert saline water to potable water is prohibitive with conventional approaches explaining why only a very small fraction of the worlds water supply is derived from desalination However modern technologies such as the Seawater Greenhouse use solar energy to desalinate seawater for agriculture and drinking uses in an extremely costeffective manner Most affected countries Based on the map published by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research CGIAR the countries and regions suffering most water stress are North Africa the Middle East India Central Asia China Chile Colombia South Africa and Australia Water scarcity is also increasing in South Asia International competition See also Waterconflict § Notableconflicts More than 50 countries on five continents are said to be at risk of conflict over water Turkeys Southeastern Anatolia Project Guneydogu Anadolu Projesi or GAP on the Euphrates has potentially serious consequences for water supplies in Syria and Iraq China is constructing dams on the Mekong leaving Vietnam Laos Cambodia and Thailand without same amount of water as before investment A huge project of reversing the flow of the Brahmaputra Chinese Tsangpo river which after leaving Chinese Tibet flows through India and Bangladesh The struggle for water in some afflicted regions has led inhabitants to hiring guards in order to protect wells Moreover Amu Daria River shared by Uzbekistan Turkmenistan Tajikistan and Afghanistan which has been nearly completely dried out so much so that it has ceased to reach the Aral SeaLake which is evaporating in an alarming pace The fact that Turkmenistan retains much of the water before it flows into Uzbekistan Intranational competition Australia Main article Water security in Australia In Australia there is competition for the resources of the Darling River system between Queensland New South Wales and South Australia In Victoria Australia a proposed pipeline from the Goulburn Valley to Melbourne has led to protests by farmers In the Macquarie Marshes of NSW grazing and irrigation interests compete for water flowing to the marshes The Snowy Mountains Scheme diverted water from the Snowy River to the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River for the benefit of irrigators and electricity generation through hydroelectric power During recent years government has taken action to increase environmental flows to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the Murray Darling Basin The Australian Government has implemented buybacks of water allocations or properties with water allocations to endeavour to increase environmental flows India Main articles Water supply and sanitation in India Pollution of the Ganges and Energy policy of India In India there is competition for water resources of all inter state rivers except the main Brahmaputra river among the riparian states of India and also with neighbouring countries which are Nepal China Pakistan Bhutan Bangladesh etc Vast area of the Indian subcontinent is under tropical climate which is conducive for agriculture due to favourable warm and sunny conditions provided perennial water supply is available to cater to the high rate of evapotranspiration from the cultivated land Though the overall water resources are adequate to meet all the requirements of the subcontinent the water supply gaps due to temporal and spatial distribution of water resources among the states and countries in the subcontinent are to be bridged There is intense competition for the water available in the inter state rivers such as Kavery Krishna Godavari Vamsadhara Mandovi RaviBeasSutlez Narmada Tapti Mahanadi etc among the riparian states of India in the absence of water augmentation from the water surplus rivers such as Brahmaputra Himalayan tributaries of Ganga and west flowing coastal rivers of western ghats All river basins face severe water shortage even for drinking needs of people cattle and wild life during the intense summer season when the rainfall is negligible Water security can be achieved along with energy security as it is going to consume electricity to link the surplus water areas with the water deficit areas by lift canals pipe lines etc The total water resources going waste to the sea are nearly 1200 billion cubic meters after sparing moderate environmental salt export water requirements of all rivers Interlinking rivers of the subcontinent is possible to achieve water security in the Indian subcontinent with the active cooperation of the countries in the region Blue Peace Blue Peace is a method which seeks to transforms transboundary water issues into instruments for cooperation This unique approach to turn tensions around water into opportunities for socioeconomic development was developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden The Blue Peace is an innovative approach to engage political leaders diplomats and populations in harnessing and managing collaborative solutions for sustainable water management — Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter of Swirtzerland speaking at the UN General Assembly Conventional fossil or nuclear energy based desalination As new technological innovations continue to reduce the capital cost of desalination more countries are building desalination plants as a small element in addressing their water crises Israel desalinizes water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter Singapore desalinizes water for 49 cents per cubic meter and also treats sewage with reverse osmosis for industrial and potable use NEWater China and India the worlds two most populous countries are turning to desalination to provide a small part of their water needs In 2007 Pakistan announced plans to use desalination All Australian capital cities except Darwin Northern Territory and Hobart are either in the process of building desalination plants or are already using them In late 2011 Melbourne will begin using Australias largest desalination plant the Wonthaggi desalination plant to raise low reservoir levels In 2007 Bermuda signed a contract to purchase a desalination plant The largest desalination plant in the United States is the one at Tampa Bay Florida which began desalinizing 25 million gallons 95000 m³ of water per day in December 2007 In the United States the cost of desalination is 306 for 1000 gallons or 81 cents per cubic meter In the United States California Arizona Texas and Florida use desalination for a very small part of their water supply After being desalinized at Jubail Saudi Arabia water is pumped 200 miles 320 km inland though a pipeline to the capital city of Riyadh A January 17 2008 article in the Wall Street Journal states Worldwide 13080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day according to the International Desalination Association The worlds largest desalination plant is the Jebel Ali Desalination Plant Phase 2 in the United Arab Emirates It is a dualpurpose facility that uses multistage flash distillation and is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year A typical aircraft carrier in the US military uses nuclear power to desalinize 400000 US gallons 1500000 L of water per day While desalinizing 1000 US gallons 3800 L of water can cost as much as 3 the same amount of bottled water costs 7945 However given the energy intensive nature of desalination with associated economic and environmental costs desalination is generally considered a last resort after water conservation But this is changing as prices continue to fall According to MSNBC a report by Lux Research estimated that the worldwide desalinated water supply will triple between 2008 and 2020 However not everyone is convinced that desalination is or will be economically viable or environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future Debbie Cook the former mayor of Huntington Beach California has been a frequent critic of desalination proposals ever since she was appointed as a member of the California Desalination Task Force Cook claims that in addition to being energy intensive desalination schemes are very costly—often much more costly than desalination proponents claim In her writing on the subject Cook points to a long list of projects that have stalled or been aborted for financial or other reasons and suggests that waterstressed regions would do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than to invest in desalination plants Solar energy based desalination A novel approach to desalination is the seawater greenhouse which takes seawater and uses solar energy to desalinate it in conjunction with growing food crops in a specially adapted greenhouse See also Right to water Water scarcity Water security and emergency preparedness References Further
