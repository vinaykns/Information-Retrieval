admission policy came into force attendance is now capped at 150000 History Founding The Goodwood Festival of Speed was founded in 1993 by Lord March in order to bring motor racing back to the Goodwood estate — a location steeped in British motor racing history Shortly after taking over the estate in the early 1990s Lord March as he is formally known wanted to bring back motor racing to Goodwood Circuit but did not have the necessary permit to host a race there Therefore he instead hosted it on his own grounds With a small selection of entrants made up of invited historic vehicles the first event that took place on Sunday 13 June proved to be a success taking in a crowd of 25000 despite a date clash with the 24 Hours of Le Mans that year After the first events date clash Lord March would ensure that the event would never be allowed to clash with either Le Mans or Formula One races In 1994 Saturday was added making it a weekend event In 1996 Friday was added making it a threeday event In 2010 the Moving Motor Show was added on the Thursday Features and attractions The hill climb Thanks to the events classification as a hill climb its location and desire to reflect the style and history of motor sport visitors are afforded close views of the action separated only by a few metres and reinforced straw bales from the track Visitors are free to walk around several paddocks where the cars and drivers can be seen at close quarters The atmosphere of the Festival of Speed when compared to the separation of fans from drivers and machines common to most top end motor sport events encourages participation by the fans The track has an elevation change of 927 metres for an average gradient of 49 The record time for the hillclimb was set in 1999 when Nick Heidfeld drove a McLaren MP413 Formula One car up the hill in 416 seconds 100385 mph 161554 kmh For safety reasons Formula One cars are no longer allowed to do official timed runs and will often focus on demonstrations that are spectacular rather than fast In 2006 Heikki Kovalainen completed the course in a Renault R25 F1 car and was unofficially timed below 40 seconds In 2016 to commemorate the 40 year anniversary of James Hunt winning the F1 World Championship McLaren commissioned a P1 GTR which ran up the hill driven by Bruno Senna Soapbox challenge From 2000 to 2004 this was a downhill race for gravitypowered cars Starting from just below the hillclimb finish line to a finish line in front of the house It included entries from Cosworth Prodrive and other top companies With some famous ridersdrivers piloting them including Barry Sheene However there were frequent accidents Despite an official cap on the cost of cars the unofficial costs were becoming too high so it did not return in 2005 The forest rally stage From 2005 to present there has been a demonstration area for the rally cars at the top of the hill Initially in 2005 the track through the forest was widened and the rally cars ran down through the forest turned on the tarmac section just outside the wood and returned up the same track This meant that the cars could only run oneatatime In 2006 a full forest stage was introduced designed by Hannu Mikkola this was a complete circuit with a separate start and finish line at the top of the wood This allowed the cars to start at timed intervals allowing many more cars to run Ever since its inception Southern Car Club have been entrusted with the organization of the rally stage held under an MSA permit Supercar run Since 2000 there has been a Sunday Times Supercar Run for roadgoing supercars Since 2014 cars could opt to do a timed run It is now common for specialty car manufacturers to show off their latest sports model including newly released massproduced sports models and working concept models Cartier Style et Luxe Since 1995 this is an auto show which takes place to the west of the house It is a similar format to the Pebble Beach Concours dElegance Entry is usually by invitation and this provides some leeway as to which type of vehicle can enter usually resulting in a more varied event than usual Concours dElegance Unlike most concours shows the Cartier Style et Luxe is judged by a panel of selected judges consisting of celebrities from all around the world to car designers The Moving Motor Show Since 2010 the Moving Motor Show was added Mainly in response to the cancellation of the British International Motor Show aimed exclusively for buyers of new cars allowing them a chance to test the cars on the course Following its success it was announced the MMS would return in 2011 The 2010 event also included the running of the new McLaren MP412C The official website lists the Festival of speed dates as the Friday to Sunday but the weekend tickets for the Festival include a moving motor show ticket So its not strictly part of the Festival of Speed but it is a part of the Festival of Speed weekend Other Other popular attractions at the event are the real life replicas of the Wacky Races cars which serves to provide lunchtime entertainment for the crowds and the airshows which usually include the RAF Tornado and Red Arrows and in 2004 and 2005 a lowflying Boeing 747 a lowflying Airbus A380 appeared at the 2008 event From the festivals beginning poster art had been illustrated by renowned motor racing artist Peter Hearsey until his retirement in 2015 In 2016 the poster art was designed by Klaus Wagger who rose to prominence as a racing artist when he won a competition to design the official poster for Mille Miglia in 2000 In recent years they have also put on the GAS Arena Goodwood Action Sports who showcase extreme stunts such as Freestyle Motorcross BMX and Trial bike Riding Other events The Festival of Speed

accidents at the event The first was during its inaugural meeting in 1993 when vintage racing motorcyclist Chas Guy was killed in practice following the completion of the course when his Vincent motorcycle developed a steering wobble known as a tank slapper throwing the rider into a tree Since then motorcycles are not timed for their run In 2000 driver John DawsonDamer lost control of his Lotus 63 and crashed into the finish line gantry killing himself and marshal Andrew Carpenter Another marshal Steve Tarrant survived but sustained serious injuries to the lower part of his right leg
