 MIT redirects here For other uses see MIT disambiguation The Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT is a private research university in Cambridge Massachusetts often cited as one of the worlds most prestigious universities Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering Researchers worked on computers radar and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War Postwar defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian The current 168acre 680 ha campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile 16 km along the northern bank of the Charles River basin The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering and more recently in biology economics linguistics and management as well For several years MITs School of Engineering has been ranked first in various international and national university rankings and the Institute is also often ranked among the worlds top universities overall The Engineers compete in 31 sports most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division IIIs New England Womens and Mens Athletic Conference the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC As of 2015 85 Nobel laureates 52 National Medal of Science recipients 65 Marshall Scholars 45 Rhodes Scholars 38 MacArthur Fellows 34 astronauts 19 Turing award winners 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force and 6 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT The school has a strong entrepreneurial culture and the aggregated revenues of companies founded by MIT alumni would rank as the eleventhlargest economy in the world History Main article History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Foundation and vision In 1859 a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay Boston for a Conservatory of Art and Science but the proposal failed A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology proposed by William Barton Rogers was signed by the governor of Massachusetts on April 10 1861 Rogers a professor from the University of Virginia wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances He did not wish to found a professional school but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education proposing that The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as I conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws The Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories Early developments Two days after the charter was issued the first battle of the Civil War broke out After a long delay through the war years MITs first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865 The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill LandGrant Colleges Act to fund institutions to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes and was a landgrant school In 1863 under the same act the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst In 1866 the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay MIT was informally called Boston Tech The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date Despite chronic financial problems the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker Programs in electrical chemical marine and sanitary engineering were introduced new buildings were built and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand The curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis with less focus on theoretical science The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership During these Boston Tech years MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president and former MIT faculty Charles W Eliots repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard Colleges Lawrence Scientific School There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard In its cramped Back Bay location MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding Eventually the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard over the vehement objections of MIT faculty students and alumni However a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme In 1916 the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge Bucentaur built for the occasion to signify MITs move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a milelong tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River The neoclassical New Technology campus was designed by William W Bosworth and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious Mr Smith starting in 1912 In January 1920 the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester New York who had invented methods of film production and processing and founded Eastman Kodak Between 1912 and 1920 Eastman donated 20 million 2366 million in 2015 dollars in cash and Kodak stock to MIT Curricular reforms In the 1930s President Karl Taylor Compton and VicePresident effectively Provost Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios The Compton reforms renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering Unlike Ivy League schools MIT catered more to middleclass families and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 Still as late as 1949 the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and governmentsponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities The School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics management political science and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs The School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980 Defense research MITs involvement in military research surged during World War II In 1941 Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including MIT Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MITs Radiation Laboratory established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area Other defense projects included gyroscopebased and other complex control systems for gunsight bombsight and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Drapers Instrumentation Laboratory the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind and highspeed and highaltitude photography under Harold Edgerton By the end of the war MIT became the nations largest wartime RD contractor attracting some criticism of Bush employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone and receiving in excess of 100 million 12 billion in 2015 dollars before 1946 Work on defense projects continued even after then Postwar governmentsponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo These activities affected MIT profoundly A 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquility of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton president of MIT between 1930 and 1948 James Rhyne Killian president from 1948 to 1957 and Julius Adams Stratton chancellor from 1952 to 1957 whose institutionbuilding strategies shaped the expanding university By the 1950s MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons philanthropic foundations and the federal government In late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MITs defense research In this period MITs various departments were researching helicopters smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research offcampus to the Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests The student body faculty and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to greater strength and unity after these times of turmoil However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas are still indignant about MITs role in military research and its suppression of these protests Richard Leacocks film November Actions records some of these tumultuous events Recent history MIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies students staff and faculty members at Project MAC the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like Spacewar and created much of modern hacker slang and culture Several major computerrelated organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s Richard Stallmans GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid1980s at the AI Lab the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim BernersLee the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002 and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005 MIT was named a seagrant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a spacegrant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus the Tang Center for Management Education several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology brain and cognitive sciences genomics biotechnology and cancer research and a number of new backlot buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab the Sloan Schools eastern campus and graduate residences in the northwest In 2006 President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption In 2001 inspired by the open source and open access movements MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes problem sets syllabuses exams and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages In 2011 MIT announced it would offer formal certification but not credits or degrees to online participants completing coursework in its MITx program for a modest fee The edX online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous Harvardx initiative The courseware platform is open source and other universities have already joined and added their own course content Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013 MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day One week later Colliers memorial service was attended by more than 10000 people in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada On November 25 2013 MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal to be awarded annually to an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life The announcement further stated that Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession those who have contributed to building bridges across the community and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness Campus Main article Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MITs 168acre 680 ha campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge which is known for being marked off in a nonstandard unit of length – the smoot The Kendall MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus in Kendall Square The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socioeconomically diverse residential neighborhoods In early 2016 MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge with plans for mixeduse educational retail residential startup incubator and office space in a dense highrise transitoriented development plan The MIT Museum will eventually be moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus Each building at MIT has a number possibly preceded by a W N E or NW designation and most have a name as well Typically academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative north west and east to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking MITs oncampus nuclear reactor is one of the most powerful universitybased nuclear reactors in the United States The prominence of the reactors containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial but MIT maintains that it is wellsecured In 1999 Bill Gates donated US20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the William H Gates Building and designed by architect Frank O Gehry While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution this was the first personal donation received from Gates Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel and a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs MITs campuswide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3000 access points covering 9400000 square feet 870000 m of campus In 2001 the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures MIT settled the suit by paying a 155000 fine and launching three environmental projects In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles subsidizing public transportation passes and building a lowemission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity heating and cooling requirements The MIT Police with state and local authorities in the 20092011 period have investigated reports of 12 forcible sex offenses 6 robberies 3 aggravated assaults 164 burglaries 1 case of arson and 4 cases of motor vehicle theft on campus affecting a community of around 22000 students and employees MIT also has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes This includes Technology Square parts of Kendall Square and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings The land is held for investment purposes and potential longterm expansion Architecture MITs School of Architecture now the School of Architecture and Planning was the first in the United States and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus completed in 1916 are sometimes called the Maclaurin buildings after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction Designed by William Welles Bosworth these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete a first for a nonindustrial – much less university – building in the US Bosworths design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s and features the Pantheonesque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court where graduation ceremonies are held each year The friezes of the limestoneclad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus Alvar Aaltos Baker House 1947 Eero Saarinens MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium 1955 and IM Peis Green Dreyfus Landau and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of postwar modernist architecture More recent buildings like Frank Gehrys Stata Center 2004 Steven Holls Simmons Hall 2002 Charles Correas Building 46 2005 and Fumihiko Makis Media Lab Extension 2009 stand out among the Boston areas classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus starchitecture These buildings have not always been well received in 2010 The Princeton Review included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are tiny unsightly or both Housing Main article Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Undergraduates are guaranteed fouryear housing in one of MITs 12 undergraduate dormitories Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from livein graduate student tutors resident advisors and faculty housemasters Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups for example according to the Yale Daily News staffs The Insiders Guide to the Colleges 2010 The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families MIT has an active Greek and coop housing system including thirtysix fraternities sororities and independent living groups FSILGs As of 2015 98 of all undergraduates lived in MITaffiliated housing 54 of the men participated in fraternities and 20 of the women were involved in sororities Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MITs West Campus that face the Charles River Basin After the 1997 alcoholrelated death of Scott Krueger a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002 Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen offcampus the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year Organization and administration MIT is chartered as a nonprofit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation The current board consists of 43 members elected to fiveyear terms 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday 3 elected officers President Treasurer and Secretary and 4 ex officio members the president of the alumni association the Governor of Massachusetts the Massachusetts Secretary of Education and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court The board is chaired by Robert Millard a cofounder of L3 Communications Holdings The Corporation approves the budget new programs degrees and faculty appointments and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institutes faculty MITs endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company MITIMCo Valued at 13182 billion in 2016 MITs endowment is the sixthlargest among American colleges and universities MIT has five schools Science Engineering Architecture and Planning Management and Humanities Arts and Social Sciences and one college Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology but no schools of law or medicine While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MITs curriculum research student life and administrative affairs the chair of each of MITs 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that departments school who in turn reports to the Provost under the President The current president is L Rafael Reif who formerly served as provost under President Susan Hockfield the first woman to hold the post Academics MIT is a large highly residential research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929 MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in midDecember a 4week Independent Activities Period in the month of January and the spring semester beginning in early February and ending in late May MIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation for example Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1 while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24 Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science EECS the most popular department collectively identify themselves as Course 6 MIT students use a combination of the departments course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects the introductory calculusbased classical mechanics course is simply 801 at MIT Undergraduate program The fouryear fulltime undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences and has been dubbed most selective by US News admitting few transfer students and 80 of its applicants in the 2015 admissions cycle MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools In the 2010–2011 academic year 1161 bachelor of science degrees abbreviated SB were granted the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards In the 2011 fall term among students who had designated a major the School of Engineering was the most popular division enrolling 63 of students in its 19 degree programs followed by the School of Science 29 School of Humanities Arts Social Sciences 37 Sloan School of Management 33 and School of Architecture and Planning 2 The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Course 6–2 Computer Science and Engineering Course 6–3 Mechanical Engineering Course 2 Physics Course 8 and Mathematics Course 18 All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements GIRs The Science Requirement generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors comprises two semesters of physics two semesters of calculus one semester of chemistry and one semester of biology There is a Laboratory Requirement usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major The Humanities Arts and Social Sciences HASS Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities arts and social sciences including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division Under the Communication Requirement two of the HASS classes plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be communicationintensive including substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation Finally all students are required to complete a swimming test nonvarsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes Most classes rely on a combination of lectures recitations led by associate professors or graduate students weekly problem sets psets and periodic quizzes or tests While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to drinking from a fire hose the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities The passnorecord grading system relieves some pressure for firstyear undergraduates For each class taken in the fall term freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed or otherwise not have any record of it In the spring term passing grades A B C appear on the transcript while nonpassing grades are again not recorded Grading had previously been passno record all freshman year but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year Also freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities such as Experimental Study Group Concourse or Terrascope In 1969 Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program UROP to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers Students join or initiate research projects UROPs for academic credit pay or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly A substantial majority of undergraduates participate Students often become published file patent applications andor launch startup companies based upon their experience in UROPs In 1970 the thenDean of Institute Relations Benson R Snyder published The Hidden Curriculum arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education The successful student according to Snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms For example organized student groups had compiled course bibles—collections of problemset and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references This sort of gamesmanship Snyder argued hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest Graduate program MITs graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities social sciences and STEM fields as well as professional degrees The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science MS various Engineers Degrees Doctor of Philosophy PhD and Doctor of Science ScD and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MDPhD with Harvard Medical School Admission to graduate programs is decentralized applicants apply directly to the department or degree program More than 90 of doctoral students are supported by fellowships research assistantships RAs or teaching assistantships TAs MIT awarded 1547 masters degrees and 609 doctoral degrees in the academic year 2010–11 In the 2011 fall term the School of Engineering was the most popular academic division enrolling 450 of graduate students followed by the Sloan School of Management 19 School of Science 169 School of Architecture and Planning 92 Whitaker College of Health Sciences 51 and School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences 47 The largest graduate degree programs were the Sloan MBA Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering Rankings It also places among the top ten in many overall rankings of universities see right and rankings based on students revealed preferences For several years US News World Report the QS World University Rankings and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MITs School of Engineering first as did the 1995 National Research Council report In the same lists MITs strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science the natural sciences business architecture economics linguistics mathematics and to a lesser extent political science and philosophy In 2014 Money magazine ranked MIT as third in the US Best Colleges for Your Money based on its assessment of the most bang for your tuition buck factoring in quality of education affordability and career outcomes As of 2014 Forbes magazine rated MIT as the second Most Entrepreneurial University based on the percentage of alumni and students selfidentifying as founders or business owners on LinkedIn In 2015 Brookings Fellow Jonathan Rothwell issued a report Beyond College Rankings placing MIT as third in the US with an estimated 45 valueadded to midcareer salary Collaborations The university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia industry and government  In 1946 President Compton Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation the first American venturecapital firm  In 1948 Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayerfunded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses On the other hand MITs extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940 MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy The US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT the eight Ivy League colleges and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in pricefixing during their annual Overlap Meetings which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for needbased scholarships While the Ivy League institutions settled MIT contested the charges arguing that the practice was not anticompetitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994 MITs proximity to Harvard University the other school up the river has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the HarvardMIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute In addition students at the two schools can crossregister for credits toward their own schools degrees without any additional fees A crossregistration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969 and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge MIT has more modest crossregistration programs with Boston University Brandeis University Tufts University Massachusetts College of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston MIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the SingaporeMIT Alliance MITPolitecnico di Milano MITZaragoza International Logistics Program and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives MISTI program The massmarket magazine Technology Review is published by MIT through a subsidiary company as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine The MIT Press is a major university press publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually emphasizing

Arts and Architecture There are also various specialized libraries and archives The libraries contain more than 29 million printed volumes 24 million microforms 49000 print or electronic journal subscriptions and 670 reference databases The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21stcentury music and electronic music the List Visual Arts Centers rotating exhibitions of contemporary art and the Compton Gallerys crossdisciplinary exhibitions MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection The MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects preserves and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public including the annual Cambridge Science Festival the first celebration of this kind in the United States Since 2005 its official mission has been to engage the wider community with MITs science technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century Research MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a research university with a very high level of research activity research expenditures totaled 7182 million in 2009 The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research with the Department of Health and Human Services granting 2559 million Department of Defense 975 million Department of Energy 658 million National Science Foundation 614 million and NASA 274 million MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty In 2011 MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions were issued 153 patents earned 854 million in cash income and received 696 million in royalties Through programs like the Deshpande Center MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multimilliondollar commercial ventures In electronics magnetic core memory radar single electron transistors

of the above fields MacArthur Fellowships the socalled Genius Grants have been awarded to 38 people associated with MIT Four Pulitzer Prize–winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Allegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage Professor David Baltimore a Nobel Laureate became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991 Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009

started in 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its timms initiative Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server The OCW movement only took off however with the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare and the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University in October 2002 The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale Utah State University the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley Radar Developed at MITs Radiation Laboratory during World War II Lisp programming language John McCarthy invented lisp in 1958 while he was at MIT McCarthy published its design in a paper in Communications of the ACM in 1960 entitled Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine Part I SKETCHPAD invented by Ivan Sutherland as his thesis for his PhD at MIT It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction HCI Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computeraided design CAD programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general Project MAC groundbreaking research in operating systems artificial intelligence and the theory of

Traditions and student activities Main articles Traditions and student activities at MIT and MIT class ring See also MIT in popular culture The faculty and student body place a high value on meritocracy and on technical proficiency MIT has never awarded an honorary degree nor does it award athletic scholarships ad eundem degrees or Latin honors upon graduation However MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993 Many upperclass students and alumni wear a large heavy distinctive class ring known as the Brass Rat Originally created in 1929 the rings official name is the Standard Technology Ring The undergraduate ring design a separate graduate student version exists as well varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class but always features a threepiece design with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver The initialism IHTFP representing the informal school motto I Hate This Fucking Place and jocularly euphemized as I Have Truly Found Paradise Institute Has The Finest Professors Its Hard to Fondle Penguins and other variations has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture Activities Main article Traditions and student activities at MIT See also Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups including a campus radio station The Tech student newspaper an annual entrepreneurship competition and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee Less traditional activities include the worlds largest openshelf collection of science fiction in English a model railroad club and a vibrant folk dance scene Students faculty and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum Edgerton Center and MIT Public Service Center The Independent Activities Period is a fourweeklong term offering hundreds of optional classes lectures demonstrations and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are the 6270 6370 and MasLab competitions the annual mystery hunt and Charm School More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad Many MIT students also engage in hacking which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally offlimits such as rooftops and steam tunnels as well as elaborate practical jokes Recent highprofile hacks have included the abduction of Caltechs cannon reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chiefs Mjölnir Helmet Athletics Main article MIT Engineers MIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs  MIT participates in the NCAAs Division III the New England Womens and Mens Athletic Conference the New England Football Conference the Pilgrim League for mens lacrosse NCAAs Division I Eastern Association of Womens Rowing Colleges EAWRC for womens crew and the Collegiate Water Polo Association CWPA for Mens Water Polo Mens crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges EARC In April 2009 budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports including the mixed mens and womens teams in alpine skiing and pistol separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics and mens programs in golf and wrestling People Students MIT enrolled 4384 undergraduates and 6510 graduate students in 2011–2012 Women constituted 45 percent of undergraduate students Undergraduate and graduate students were drawn from all 50 states as well as 115 foreign countries MIT received 17909 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2015 1742 were admitted 97 percent and 1128 enrolled 648 percent 19446 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree program across all departments 2991 were admitted 154 percent and 1880 enrolled 628 percent The interquartile range on the SAT was 2090–2340 and 97 percent of students ranked in the top tenth of their high school graduating class 97 percent of the Class of 2012 returned as sophomores 82 percent of the Class of 2007 graduated within 4 years and 93 percent 91 percent of the men and 95 percent of the women graduated within 6 years Undergraduate tuition and fees total 40732 and annual expenses are estimated at 52507 as of 2012 62 percent of students received needbased financial aid in the form of scholarships and grants from federal state institutional and external sources averaging 38964 per student Students were awarded a total of 102 million in scholarships and grants primarily from institutional support 84 million The annual increase in expenses has led to a student tradition dating back to the 1960s of tongueincheek tuition riots MIT has been nominally coeducational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870 Richards also became the first female member of MITs faculty specializing in sanitary chemistry Female students remained a minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a womens dormitory McCormick Hall in 1963 Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students Women currently outnumber men in Biology Brain Cognitive Sciences Architecture Urban Planning and Biological Engineering A number of student deaths in the late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in considerable media attention to MITs culture and student life After the alcoholrelated death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity MIT began requiring all freshmen to live in the dormitory system The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate In late 2001 a task forces recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis Faculty and staff Main article List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty As of 2013 MIT had 1030 faculty members of whom 225 were women Faculty are responsible for lecturing classes advising both graduate and undergraduate students and sitting on academic committees as well as conducting original research

twentyseven Nobel Prizes the majority in Economics or Physics As of October 2013 among current faculty and teaching staff there are 67 Guggenheim Fellows 6 Fulbright Scholars and 22 MacArthur Fellows Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures A 1998 MIT study concluded that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its School of Science although the studys methods were controversial Since the study though women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and of Engineering and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents although allegations of sexism continue to be made Susan Hockfield a molecular neurobiologist was MITs president from 2004 to 2012 and was the first woman to hold the post Tenure outcomes have vaulted MIT into the national spotlight on several occasions The 1984 dismissal of David F Noble a historian of technology became a cause célèbre about the extent to which academics are granted freedom of speech after he published several books and papers critical of MITs and other research universities reliance upon financial support from corporations and the military Former materials science professor Gretchen Kalonji sued MIT in 1994 alleging that she was denied tenure because of sexual discrimination Several years later the lawsuit was settled with undisclosed payments and establishment of a project to encourage women and minorities to seek faculty positions In 1997 the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination issued a probable cause finding supporting UMass Boston Professor James Jennings allegations of racial discrimination after a senior faculty search committee in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning did not offer him reciprocal tenure In 2006–2007 MITs denial of tenure to AfricanAmerican stem cell scientist professor James Sherley reignited accusations of racism in the tenure process eventually leading to a protracted public dispute with the administration a brief hunger strike and the resignation of Professor Frank L Douglas in protest The Boston Globe reported on February 6 2007 Less than half of MITs junior faculty members are granted tenure After Sherley was initially denied tenure his case was examined three times before the university established that neither racial discrimination nor conflict of interest affected the decision Twentyone of Sherleys colleagues issued a statement yesterday saying that the professor was treated fairly in tenure review MIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities Founding faculty member Charles W Eliot was recruited in 1869 to become president of Harvard University a post he would hold for 40 years during which he wielded considerable influence on both American higher education and secondary education MIT alumnus and
