 JP1 redirects here For other uses see JP1 Jet fuel aviation turbine fuel ATF or avtur is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gasturbine engines It is colorless to strawcolored in appearance The most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A1 which are produced to a standardized international specification The only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbineengine powered aviation is Jet B which is used for its enhanced coldweather performance Jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different hydrocarbons The range of their sizes molecular weights or carbon numbers is defined by the requirements for the product such as the freezing or smoke point Kerosenetype jet fuel including Jet A and Jet A1 has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 carbon atoms per molecule widecut or naphthatype jet fuel including Jet B between about 5 and 15 History Fuel for pistonengine powered aircraft usually a highoctane gasoline known as avgas has a low flash point to improve its ignition characteristics Turbine engines can operate with a wide range of fuels and jetaircraft engines typically use fuels with higher flash points which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle The first axial compressor jet engine in widespread production and combat service the Junkers Jumo 004 used on the Messerschmitt Me 262A fighter and the Arado Ar 234B jet reconbomber burned either a special synthetic J2 fuel or diesel fuel Gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption Other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures Most jet fuels in use since the end of World War II are kerosenebased Both British and American standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of World War II British standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lamps—known as paraffin in the UK—whereas American standards derived from aviation gasoline practices Over the subsequent years details of specifications were adjusted such as minimum freezing point to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels Very low temperature freezing points reduce the availability of fuel Higher flash point products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce In the United States ASTM International produces standards for civilian fuel types and the US Department of Defense produces standards for military use The British Ministry of Defence establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels For reasons of interoperational ability British and United States military standards are harmonized to a degree In Russia and former Soviet Union countries grades of jet fuels are covered by the State Standard GOST number or a Technical Condition number with the principal grade available in Russia and members of the CIS being TS1 Types Jet A Jet A specification fuel has been used in the United States since the 1950s and is usually not available outside the United States and a few Canadian airports such as Toronto and Vancouver whereas Jet A1 is the standard specification fuel used in the rest of the world other than the former Soviet states where TS1 is the most common standard Both Jet A and Jet A1 have a flash point higher than 38 °C 100 °F with an autoignition temperature of 210 °C 410 °F Differences between Jet A and Jet A1 The primary difference is the lower freezing point of A1 Jet As is −40 °C −40 °F Jet A1s is −47 °C −53 °F The other difference is the mandatory addition of an antistatic additive to Jet A1 Jet A trucks storage tanks and plumbing that carry Jet A are marked with a black sticker with Jet A in white printed on it adjacent to another black stripe Typical physical properties for Jet A and Jet A1 Jet A1 fuel must meet DEF STAN 9191 Jet A1 ASTM specification D1655 Jet A1 and IATA Guidance Material Kerosene Type NATO Code F35 Jet A fuel must reach ASTM specification D1655 Jet A Typical physical properties for Jet A Jet A1 Jet B Jet B is a fuel in the naphthakerosene region that is used for its enhanced coldweather performance However Jet Bs lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle For this reason it is rarely used except in very cold climates A blend of approximately 30 kerosene and 70 gasoline it is known as widecut fuel It has a very low freezing point of −60 °C −76 °F and a low flash point as well It is primarily used in some military aircraft It is also used in Northern Canada Alaska and sometimes Russia because of its low freezing point Additives The DEF STAN 9191 UK and ASTM D1655 international specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel including Antioxidants to prevent gumming usually based on alkylated phenols eg AO30 AO31 or AO37 Antistatic agents to dissipate static electricity and prevent sparking Stadis 450 with dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid DINNSA as a component is an example Corrosion inhibitors eg DCI4A used for civilian and military fuels and DCI6A used for military fuels Fuel system icing inhibitor FSII agents eg DiEGME FSII is often mixed at the pointofsale so that users with heated fuel lines do not have to pay the extra expense Biocides are to remediate microbial ie bacterial and fungal growth present in aircraft fuel systems Currently two biocides are approved for use by most aircraft and turbine engine original equipment manufacturers OEMs Kathon FP15 Microbiocide and Biobor JF Metal deactivator can be added to remediate the deleterious effects of trace metals on the thermal stability of the fuel The one allowable additive is NN’disalicylidene 12propanediamine As the aviation industry’s jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5 of all refined products derived from crude it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene a high value product by varying process techniques New processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the manufacture of synthetic blend stocks Due to the number and severity of the processes used it is often necessary and sometimes mandatory to use additives These additives may for example prevent the formation of harmful chemical species or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear Water in jet fuel It is very important that jet fuel be free from water contamination During flight the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank because it is denser than the fuel Since the water is no longer in solution it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °C If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes This was the cause of the British Airways Flight 38 accident Removing all water from fuel is impractical therefore fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing There are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel A visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance An industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a watersensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm parts per million free water A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer Military jet fuels Military organizations around the world use a different classification system of JP for Jet Propellant numbers Some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives Jet A1 is similar to JP8 Jet B is similar to JP4 Other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications Jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphthatype Kerosenetype fuels include Jet A Jet A1 JP5 and JP8 Naphthatype jet fuels sometimes referred to as widecut jet fuel include Jet B and JP4 The JP4 and JP5 fuels covered by the MILDTL5624 and meeting the British Specification DEF STAN 9186 AVCATFSII formerly DERD 2452 are intended for use in aircraft turbine engines These fuels require militaryunique additives that are necessary in military weapon systems engines and missions Piston engine use Jet fuel is very similar to diesel fuel and in some cases may be burned in diesel engines The possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance has left aircraft designers and pilots organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft As a result a few aircraft engine manufacturers most notably Thielert and Austro Engine have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel This technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required Jet fuel is available in most places in the world whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of general aviation aircraft A diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuelefficient than an avgas engine However very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today even though opposedpiston aviation diesel powerplants such as the Junkers Jumo 205 family had been used during the Second World War Jet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports instead of diesel The United States military makes heavy use of JP8 for instance However jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine parts Civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its lubricity Jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances Jet fuel contains more sulfur up to 1000 ppm which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require The introduction of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers Pipeline diesels before ULSD were able to contain up to 500 ppm of sulfur and was called Low Sulfur Diesel or LSD LSD is now only available to the offroad construction locomotive and marine markets As more EPA regulations are introduced more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel as determined by ASTM Standard D445 Synthetic jet fuel Main article Synthetic fuel A significant effort is under way to certify Fischer–Tropsch FT Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene SPK synthetic fuels for use in United States and international aviation fleets In this effort is being led by an industry coalition known as the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative CAAFI also supported by a parallel initiative under way in the USAF to certify FT fuel for use in all aviation platforms The USAF has a stated goal of certifying its entire fleet for use with FT synthetic fuel blends by 2011 The CAAFI initiative aims to certify the civilian aviation fleet for FT synthetic fuels blends by 2010 and has programs under way to certify Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids HEFA aka Hydrogenated Renewable Jet HRJ SPK biofuels as early as 2013 Hydroprocessed and hydrotreated have also been used in lieu of hydrogenated Both FT and HEFA based SPKs blended with JP8 are specified in MILDTL83133H Some synthetic jet fuels show a reduction in pollutants such as SOx NOx particulate matter and sometimes carbon emissions It is envisaged that usage of synthetic jet fuels will increase air quality around airports which will be particularly advantageous at inner city airports Qatar Airways became the first airline to operate a commercial flight on a 5050 blend of synthetic Gas to Liquid GTL jet fuel and conventional jet fuel The natural gas derived synthetic kerosene for the sixhour flight from London to Doha came from Shells GTL plant in Bintulu Malaysia The worlds first passenger aircraft flight to use only synthetic jet fuel was from Lanseria International Airport to Cape Town International Airport on September 22 2010 The fuel was developed by Sasol Chemist Heather Willauer is leading a team of researchers at the US Naval Research Laboratory who are developing a process to make jet fuel from seawater The technology requires an input of electrical energy to separate carbon dioxide CO2 and hydrogen H2 gas from seawater using an ironbased catalyst followed by an oligomerization step wherein carbon monoxide CO and hydrogen are recombined into longchain hydrocarbons using zeolite as the catalyst The technology is expected to be deployed in the 2020s by US Navy warships especially nuclearpowered aircraft carriers USAF synthetic fuel trials On August 8 2007 Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B52H as fully approved to use the FT blend marking the formal conclusion of the test program This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative an effort to develop secure domestic sources for the military energy needs The Pentagon hopes to reduce its use of crude oil from foreign producers and obtain about half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016 With the B52 now approved to use the FT blend the USAF will use the test protocols developed during the program to certify the C17 Globemaster III and then the B1B to use the fuel To test these two aircraft the USAF has ordered 281000 US gal 1060000 l of FT fuel The USAF intends to test and certify every airframe in its inventory to use the fuel by 2011 They will also supply over 9000 US gallons 34000 l 7500 imp gal to NASA for testing in various aircraft and engines The USAF has certified the B1B B52H C17 C130J F4 as QF4 target drones F15 F22 and T38 to use the synthetic fuel blend The US Air Forces C17 Globemaster III F16 and F15 are certified for use of hydrotreated renewable jet fuels The USAF plans to certify over 40 models for fuels derived from waste oils and plants by 2013 The US Army is considered one of the few customers of biofuels large enough to potentially bring biofuels up to the volume production needed to reduce costs The US Navy has also flown a Boeing FA18EF Super Hornet dubbed the Green Hornet at 17 times the speed of sound using a biofuel blend The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA funded a 67 million project with Honeywell UOP to develop technologies to create jet fuels from biofeedstocks for use by the United States and NATO militaries Jet biofuels Main articles Aviation biofuel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel The air transport industry is responsible for 23 percent of manmade carbon dioxide emitted Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flightrelated greenhousegas emissions by 60 to 80 percent One possible solution which has received more media coverage than others would be blending synthetic fuel derived from algae with existing jet fuel Green Flight International became the first airline to fly jet aircraft on 100 biofuel The flight from Reno Stead Airport in Stead Nevada was in an Aero L29 Delfín piloted by Carol Sugars and Douglas Rodante Boeing and Air New Zealand are collaborating with Tecbio Aquaflow Bionomic and other jet biofuel developers around the world Virgin Atlantic successfully tested a biofuel blend consisting of 20 percent babassu nuts and coconut and 80 percent conventional jet fuel which was fed to a single engine on a 747 flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam Schiphol A consortium consisting of Boeing NASAs Glenn Research Center MTU Aero Engines Germany and the US Air Force Research Laboratory is working on development of jet fuel blends containing a substantial percentage of biofuel British Airways and Solena Group are establishing a sustainable jet fuel plant in East London UK as BA plans to use the biofuel to power part of its fleet from 2014 24 commercial and military biofuel flights have taken place using Honeywell “Green Jet Fuel” including a Navy FA18 Hornet In 2011 United Continental Holdings was the first United States airline to fly passengers on a commercial flight using a blend of sustainable advanced biofuels and traditional petroleumderived jet fuel Solazyme developed the algae oil which was refined utilizing Honeywells UOP process technology into jet fuel to power the commercial flight Solazyme produced the worlds first 100 percent algaederived jet fuel Solajet for both commercial and military applications Oil prices increased about fivefold from 2003 to 2008 raising fears that world petroleum production is becoming unable to keep up with demand The fact that there are few alternatives to petroleum for aviation fuel adds urgency to the search for alternatives Twentyfive airlines were bankrupted or stopped operations in the first six months of 2008 largely due to fuel costs In 2015 ASTM approved a modification to Specification D1655 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuels to permit up to 50 ppm 50 mgkg of FAME fatty acid methyl ester in jet fuel to allow higher crosscontamination from biofuel production Worldwide consumption of jet fuel Worldwide demand of jet fuel has been steadily increasing since 1980 Consumption more than tripled in 30 years from 1837000 barrelsday in 1980 to 5220000 in 2010 Around 30 of the worldwide consumption of jet fuel is in the US 1398130 barrelsday in 2012 See also References External links History of Jet Fuel MILDTL5624U MILDTL83133H Aviation Fuel Properties 1983
