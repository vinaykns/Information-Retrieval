fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain For millennia Chinas political system was based on hereditary monarchies known as dynasties beginning with the Xia dynasty c 2070 BCE Since 221 BCE when the Qin dynasty conquered the other largest six states to form the first unified Chinese empire China has then expanded fractured and reunified numerous times in the following millennia In 1912 The Republic of China ROC replaced the last dynasty and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949 when it was defeated by the communist Peoples Liberation Army in the Chinese Civil War The Communist Party established the Peoples Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949 while the ROC government relocated to Taiwan with its present de facto temporary capital in Taipei Both the ROC and PRC continue to claim to be the legitimate government of all China though the latter has more recognition in the world and controls more territory Since the introduction of economic reforms in

APEC BRICS the Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO the BCIM and the G20 Names Main article Names of China The English name China is first attested in Richard Edens 1555 translation of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa The demonym that is the name for the people and adjectival form Chinese developed later on the model of Portuguese chinês and French chinois Portuguese China is thought to derive from Persian Chīn چین and perhaps ultimately from Sanskrit Cīna चीन Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture including the Mahābhārata 5th century BCE and the Laws of Manu 2nd century BCE The traditional theory proposed in the 17th century by Martino Martini and supported by many later scholars is that the word China and its earlier related forms are ultimately derived from the state of Qin 秦 Old Chinese Dzin the westernmost of the Chinese states during the Zhou dynasty which unified China to form the Qin dynasty There are however other suggestions for the derivation of China The official name of the modern state is the Peoples Republic of China Chinese 中华人民共和国 pinyin Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó The shorter form is China Zhōngguó 中国 from zhōng central or middle and guó state nationstate a term which developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne It was then applied to the area around Luoyi presentday Luoyang during the Eastern Zhou and then to Chinas Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia tribes from perceived barbarians and was the source of the English name Middle Kingdom A more literary or inclusive name alluding to the land of Chinese civilization is Zhōnghuá 中华 It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of the central state of the Huaxia During the 1950s and 1960s after the defeat of the Kuomingtang in the Chinese Civil War it was also referred to as Communist China or Red China to be differentiated from Nationalist China or Free China History Main articles History of China and Timeline of Chinese history Prehistory Main article Chinese prehistory Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 224 million and 250000 years ago The hominid fossils of Peking Man a Homo erectus who used fire were discovered in a cave at Zhoukoudian near Beijing they have been dated to between 680000 and 780000 years ago The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens dated to 125000–80000 years ago have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County Hunan Chinese protowriting existed in Jiahu around 7000 BCE Damaidi around 6000 BCE Dadiwan from 5800–5400 BCE and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols 7th millennium BCE constituted the earliest Chinese writing system Early dynastic rule Further information Dynasties in Chinese history According to Chinese tradition the first dynasty was the Xia which emerged around 2100 BCE The dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou Henan in 1959 It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE Their oracle bone script from c 1500 BCE represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters The Shang were conquered by the Zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords Many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300year Spring and Autumn period only occasionally deferring to the Zhou king By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now China each with its own king ministry and army Imperial China The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified Chinese state Its King Zheng proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty Qín Shǐhuáng or Shǐ Huángdì He enacted Qins legalist reforms throughout China notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters measurements road widths ie cart axles length and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi Guangdong and Vietnam The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the First Emperors death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion Following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at Xianyang was burned the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and CE 220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese The Han expanded the empires territory considerably with military campaigns reaching Central Asia Mongolia Korea and Yunnan and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world Despite the Hans initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism Qins legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors After the collapse of Han a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the Four Classics of Chinese literature At its end Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentallydisabled emperor the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen Kingdoms The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into Chinese culture In the south the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581 The Sui restored the Han to power through China reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the Grand Canal and patronized Buddhism However they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war with Korea provoked widespread unrest Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties Chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age The Tang Empire returned control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road and made the capital Changan a cosmopolitan urban center However it was devastated and weakened by the An Shi Rebellion in the 8th century In 907 the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable The Song Dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960 leading to a balance of power between the Song and Khitan Liao The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade Between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China and the production of abundant food surpluses The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity However the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty In 1127 Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song Wars The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China In the 13th century China was gradually conquered by the Mongol Empire In 1271 the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279 Before the Mongol invasion the population of Song China was 120 million citizens this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300 A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty Under the Ming Dynasty China enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture It was during this period that Zheng He led voyages throughout the world reaching as far as Africa In the early years of the Ming Dynasty Chinas capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing With the budding of capitalism philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded NeoConfucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations The scholarofficial stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and the wars against Japanese invasions of Korea and Manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury In 1644 Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng The last Ming Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell The Manchu Qing dynasty then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui overthrew Lis shortlived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty End of dynastic rule The Qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1912 was the last imperial dynasty of China Its conquest of the Ming 1618–1683 cost 25 million lives and the economy of China shrank drastically After the Southern Ming ended the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire The centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on antiQing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce the Haijin sea ban and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing social and technological stagnation In the mid19th century the dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the Opium Wars with Britain and France China was forced to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede Hong Kong to the British under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking the first of the Unequal Treaties The First SinoJapanese War 1894–95 resulted in Qing Chinas loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt 1862–77 in the northwest The initial success of the SelfStrengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s In the 19th century the great Chinese diaspora began Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–79 in which between 9 and 13 million people died In 1898 the Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi The illfated antiforeign Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms the Xinhai Revolution of 1911–12 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China Republic of China 1912–49 Main articles Republic of China 1912–49 and History of the Republic of China See also Taiwan and Taiwan after World War II On 1 January 1912 the Republic of China was established and Sun Yatsen of the Kuomintang the KMT or Nationalist Party was proclaimed provisional president However the presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army he was forced to abdicate and reestablish the republic After Yuan Shikais death in 1916 China was politically fragmented Its Beijingbased government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory In the late 1920s the Kuomintang under Chiang Kaishek the then Principal of the Republic of China Military Academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings known collectively as the Northern Expedition The Kuomintang moved the nations capital to Nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yatsens Sanmin program for transforming China into a modern democratic state The political division in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the Communist Peoples Liberation Army PLA against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the Chinese Civil War This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang especially after the PLA retreated in the Long March until Japanese aggression and the 1936 Xian Incident forced Chiang to confront Imperial Japan The Second SinoJapanese War 1937–1945 a theater of World War II forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the PLA Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population in all as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died An estimated 200000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation During the war China along with the UK the US and the Soviet Union were referred to as trusteeship of the powerful and were recognized as the Allied Big Four in the Declaration by United Nations Along with the other three great powers China was one of the four major Allies of World War II and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war After the surrender of Japan in 1945 Taiwan including the Pescadores was returned to Chinese control China emerged victorious but warravaged and financially drained The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war In 1947 constitutional rule was established but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China Peoples Republic of China 1949–present Main article History of the Peoples Republic of China Major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of most of mainland China and the Kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the ROCs territory to only Taiwan Hainan and their surrounding islands On 1 October 1949 Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China In 1950 the Peoples Liberation Army succeeded in capturing Hainan from the ROC and incorporating Tibet However remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s The regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform which saw between 1 and 2 million landlords executed Under its leadership China developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons The Chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million However the Great Leap Forward a largescale economic and social reform project resulted in an estimated 45 million deaths between 1958 and 1961 mostly from starvation In 1966 Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until Maos death in 1976 In October 1971 the PRC replaced the Republic of China in the United Nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council After Maos death the Gang of Four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution In 1978 Deng Xiaoping took power and instituted significant economic reforms The Communist Party loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of private land leases This marked Chinas transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982 In 1989 the violent suppression of student protests in Tiananmen Square brought condemnation and sanctions against the Chinese government from various countries Jiang Zemin Li Peng and Zhu Rongji led the nation in the 1990s Under their administration Chinas economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 112 The country formally joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and maintained its high rate of economic growth under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabaos leadership in the 2000s However rapid growth also severely impacted the countrys resources and environment and caused major social displacement Living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late2000s recession but centralized political control remained tight Preparations for a decadal Communist Party leadership change in 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals During Chinas 18th National Communist Party Congress in November 2012 Hu Jintao was replaced as General Secretary of the Communist Party by Xi Jinping Under Xi the Chinese government began largescale efforts to reform its economy which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth The Xi–Li Administration also announced major reforms to the onechild policy and prison system Geography Main article Geography of China Political geography Main articles Borders of China and Territorial changes of the Peoples Republic of China The Peoples Republic of China is the secondlargest country in the world by land area after Russia and is either the third or fourthlargest by total area after Russia Canada and depending on the definition of total area the United States Chinas total area is generally stated as being approximately 9600000 km 3700000 sq mi Specific area figures range from 9572900 km 3696100 sq mi according to the Encyclopædia Britannica 9596961 km 3705407 sq mi according to the UN Demographic Yearbook to 9596961 km 3705407 sq mi according to the CIA World Factbook China has the longest combined land border in the world measuring 22117 km 13743 mi from the mouth of the Yalu River to the

Asia India Bhutan Nepal Afghanistan and Pakistan in South Asia Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia and Russia Mongolia and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia Additionally China shares maritime boundaries with South Korea Japan Vietnam and the Philippines Landscape and climate The territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N and longitudes 73° and 135° E Chinas landscapes vary significantly across its vast width In the east along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north broad grasslands predominate Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges while the centraleast hosts the deltas of Chinas two major rivers the Yellow River and the Yangtze River Other major rivers include the Xi Mekong Brahmaputra and Amur To the west sit major mountain ranges most notably the Himalayas High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert The worlds highest point Mount Everest 8848m lies on the SinoNepalese border The countrys lowest point and the worlds thirdlowest is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake −154m in the Turpan Depression Chinas climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer In the winter northern winds coming from highlatitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist The climate in China differs from region to region because of the countrys highly complex topography A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts particularly the Gobi Desert Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring which then spread to other parts of east Asia including Korea and Japan Chinas environmental watchdog SEPA stated in 2007 that China is losing a million acres 4000 km² per year to desertification Water quality erosion and pollution control have become important issues in Chinas relations with other countries Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people Biodiversity Main article Wildlife of China China is one of 17 megadiverse countries lying in two of the worlds major ecozones the Palearctic and the Indomalaya By one measure China has over 34687 species of animals and vascular plants making it the thirdmost biodiverse country in the world after Brazil and Colombia The country signed the Rio de

seventh and 333 species of amphibians seventh China is the most biodiverse country in each category outside the tropics Wildlife in China share habitat with and bear acute pressure from the worlds largest population of homo sapiens At least 840 animal species are threatened vulnerable or in danger of local extinction in China due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction pollution and poaching for food fur and ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine Endangered wildlife is protected by law and as of 2005 the country has over 2349 nature reserves covering a total area of 14995 million hectares 15 percent of Chinas total land area China has over 32000 species of vascular plants and is home to a variety of forest types Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear along with over 120 bird species The understorey of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo In higher montane stands of juniper and yew the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons Subtropical forests which are predominate in central and southern China support as many as 146000 species of flora Tropical and seasonal rainforests though confined to Yunnan and Hainan Island contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China China has over 10000 recorded species of fungi and of them nearly 6000 are higher fungi Environmental issues Main article Environmental issues in China See also Water resources of China In recent decades China has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent they are poorly enforced as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development Urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country the World Bank estimated in 2013 that 16 of the worlds 20 mostpolluted cities are located in China China is the worlds largest carbon dioxide emitter The country also has significant water pollution problems 40 of Chinas rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011 In 2014 the internal freshwater resources per capita of China reduced to 2062m and it was below 500m in the North China Plain while 5920m in the world However China is the worlds leading investor in renewable energy commercialization with 52 billion invested in 2011 alone it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in localscale renewable energy projects By 2009 over 17 of Chinas energy was derived from renewable sources – most notably hydroelectric power plants of which China has a total installed capacity of 197 GW In 2011 the Chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan US619 billion in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a tenyear period and to complete construction of a flood prevention and antidrought system by 2020 In 2013 China began a fiveyear US277 billion effort to reduce air pollution particularly in the north of the country Politics Main article Politics of China See also List of current

contested elections are now held at the village and town levels However the Party retains effective control over government appointments in the absence of meaningful opposition the CPC wins by default most of the time Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption Nonetheless the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high with 80–95 of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government according to a 2011 survey Administrative divisions Main articles Administrative divisions of China Districts of Hong Kong and Municipalities of Macau The Peoples Republic of China is divided into 22 provinces five autonomous regions each with a designated minority group four municipalities and two Special Administrative Regions SARs which enjoy a degree of political autonomy These 31 provinciallevel divisions can be collectively referred to as mainland China a term which usually excludes two SARs of Hong Kong and Macau Geographically all 31 provincial divisions can be grouped into six regions including North China Northeast China East China South Central China Southwest China and Northwest China China considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province although Taiwan is governed by the Republic of China which disputes the PRCs claim None of the divisions are recognized by the ROC government which claims the entirety of the PRCs territory Foreign relations Main article Foreign relations of China The PRC has diplomatic relations with 173 countries and maintains embassies in 162 Its legitimacy is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition In 1971 the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council China was also a former member and leader of the NonAligned Movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries Along with Brazil Russia India and South Africa China is a member of the BRICS group of emerging major economies and hosted the groups third official summit at Sanya Hainan in April 2011 Under its interpretation of the OneChina policy Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan especially in the matter of armament sales Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlais Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences This policy may have led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations such as Zimbabwe North Korea and Iran China has a close economic and military relationship with Russia and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council Trade relations In recent decades China has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its AsiaPacific neighbours China became a member of the World Trade Organization WTO on 11 December 2001 In 2004 it proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit EAS framework as a forum for regional security issues The EAS which

as Taiwan as a part of its territory It regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province These claims are controversial because of the complicated CrossStrait relations with the PRC treating the OneChina policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles In addition to Taiwan China is also involved in other international territorial disputes Since the 1990s China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with India and an undefined border with Bhutan China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas such as the Senkaku Islands and the Scarborough Shoal On 21 May 2014 President Xi speaking at a conference in Shanghai pledged to settle Chinas territorial disputes peacefully China stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests he said Emerging superpower status China is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century Others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt Chinas growth as the century progresses Some authors also question the definition of superpower arguing that Chinas large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the United States Sociopolitical issues human rights and reform See also Human rights in China Hukou system Social welfare in China Elections in the Peoples Republic of China Censorship in China and Feminism in China The Chinese democracy movement social activists and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted The Constitution of the Peoples Republic of China states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights However in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling Communist Party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most

low level of press freedom In 2014 China ranked 175th out of 180 countries Rural migrants to Chinas cities often find themselves treated as secondclass citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits Property rights are often poorly protected and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens However a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellers A number of foreign governments foreign press agencies and NGOs also routinely criticize Chinas human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced abortions forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights and excessive use of the death penalty The government has suppressed popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Falun Gong was first taught publicly in 1992 In 1999 when there were 70 million practitioners the persecution of Falun Gong began resulting in mass arrests extralegal detention and reports of torture and deaths in custody The Chinese state is regularly accused of largescale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression The Chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a countrys present level of economic development It emphasizes the rise in the Chinese standard of living literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial Yangtze River floods Furthermore some Chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization although others remain more conservative Some major reform efforts have been conducted for an instance in November 2013 the government announced plans to relax the onechild policy and abolish the muchcriticized reeducation through labour program though human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic During the 2000s and early 2010s the Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical efficient solutions to social problems but such third sector activity remained heavily regulated Military Main articles Military history of China

totalled US132 billion constituting the worlds secondlargest military budget However many authorities – including SIPRI and the US Office of the Secretary of Defense – argue that China does not report its real level of military spending which is allegedly much higher than the official budget As a recognized nuclear weapons state China is considered both a major regional military power and a potential military superpower According to a 2013 report by the US Department of Defense China fields between 50 and 75 nuclear ICBMs along with a number of SRBMs However compared with the other four UN Security Council Permanent Members China has relatively limited power projection capabilities To offset this it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s – its first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012 and it maintains a substantial fleet of submarines including several nuclearpowered attack and ballistic missile submarines China has furthermore established a network of foreign military relationships along critical sea lanes China has made significant progress in modernising its air force in recent decades purchasing Russian fighter jets such as the Sukhoi Su30 and also manufacturing its own modern fighters most notably the Chengdu J10 J20 and the Shenyang J11 J15 J16 and J31 China is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones Air and Sea denial weaponry advances have increased the regional threat from the perspective of Japan as well as Washington China has also updated its ground forces replacing its ageing Sovietderived tank inventory with numerous variants of the modern Type 99 tank and upgrading its battlefield C3I and C4I systems to enhance its networkcentric warfare capabilities In addition China has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile systems including antisatellite missiles cruise missiles and submarinelaunched nuclear ICBMs According to the Stockholm International

1949–present From its founding in 1949 until late 1978 the Peoples Republic of China was a Sovietstyle centrally planned economy Following Maos death in 1976 and the consequent end of the Cultural Revolution Deng Xiaoping and the new Chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more marketoriented mixed economy under oneparty rule Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized while foreign trade became a major new focus leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones SEZs Inefficient stateowned enterprises SOEs were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright resulting in massive job losses Modernday China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism The state still dominates in strategic pillar sectors such as energy production and heavy industries but private enterprise has expanded enormously with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008 Since economic liberalization began in 1978 China has been among the worlds fastestgrowing economies relying largely on investment and exportled growth According to

global leader in manufacturing However the Chinese economy is highly energyintensive and inefficient China became the worlds largest energy consumer in 2010 relies on coal to supply over 70 of its energy needs and surpassed the US to become the worlds largest oil importer in September 2013 In the early 2010s Chinas economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles weakening

Great Inventions later became widespread in Asia and Europe Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers However by the 17th century the Western world had surpassed China in scientific and technological development The causes of this Great Divergence continue to be debated After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the SelfStrengthening Movement After the Communists came to power in 1949 efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union in which scientific research was part of central planning After Maos death in 1976 science and technology was established as one of the Four Modernizations and the Sovietinspired academic system was gradually reformed Modern era Since the end of the Cultural Revolution China has made significant investments in scientific research with 163 billion spent on scientific research and development in 2012 Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving Chinas economic and political goals and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as technonationalism Nonetheless Chinas investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the United States and Japan Chineseborn scientists have won the Nobel Prize in Physics four times the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine once respectively though most of these scientists conducted their Nobelwinning research in

urban unemployment rate of China was about 41 With a population of over 13 billion and dwindling natural resources the government of China is very concerned about its population growth rate and has attempted since 1979 with mixed results to implement a strict family planning policy known as the onechild policy Before 2013 this policy sought to restrict families to one child each with exceptions for ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas A major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013 allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child In 2016 the onechild policy was replaced in favor of a twochild policy Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may be around 14 The policy along with traditional preference for boys may be contributing to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth According to the 2010 census the sex ratio at birth was 11806 boys for every 100 girls which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls The 2010 census found that males accounted for 5127 percent of the total population However Chinas sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953 when males accounted for 5182

Campaign which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene as well as treating and preventing several diseases Diseases such as cholera typhoid and scarlet fever which were previously rife in China were nearly eradicated by the campaign After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978 the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the Peoples Communes Healthcare in China became mostly privatized and experienced a significant rise in quality In 2009 the government began a 3year largescale healthcare provision initiative worth US124 billion By 2011 the campaign resulted in 95 of Chinas population having basic health insurance coverage In 2011

respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers and an increase in obesity among urban youths Chinas large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS although this has since been largely contained In 2010 air pollution caused 12 million premature deaths in China Religion Main article Religion in China Freedom of religion is guaranteed by Chinas constitution although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution The government of the Peoples Republic of China is officially atheist Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the State Administration for Religious Affairs Over the millennia Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements The three teachings including Confucianism Taoism and Buddhism Chinese Buddhism historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture Chinese folk religion which contains elements of the three teachings consists in allegiance to the shen 神 a character that signifies the energies of generation who can be deities of the natural environment or ancestral principles of human groups concepts of civility culture heroes many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history Among the most popular folk cults are those of

of the worlds tallest religious statues including the tallest of all the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan Clear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions on religion and the unorganized nature of Chinese religious traditions Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between religions especially Buddhism Taoism and local folk religious practice A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61 of Chinese people selfidentified as convinced atheist According to one study from 2012 about 90 of the Chinese population are

Hui and Uyghur peoples Culture Main articles Chinese culture and Culture of the Peoples Republic of China Since ancient times Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism and conservative philosophies For much of the countrys dynastic era opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations which have their origins in the Han Dynasty The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China such as the belief that calligraphy poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inwardlooking national perspective Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today The first leaders of the Peoples Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture such as rural land tenure sexism and the Confucian system of education while preserving others such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history while others claim that the Communist Partys rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed having been denounced as regressive and harmful or vestiges of feudalism Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture such as Confucianism art literature and performing arts like Peking opera were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted Today the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution various forms of traditional Chinese art literature music film fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide China is now the thirdmostvisited country in the world with
