 Intergenerational equity in economic psychological and sociological contexts is the concept or idea of fairness or justice in relationships between children youth adults and seniors particularly in terms of treatment and interactions It has been studied in environmental and sociological settings Economics usage History Since the first recorded debt issuance in Sumaria in 1796 BC one of the penalties for failure to repay a loan has been debt bondage In some instances this repayment of financial debt with labor included the debtors children essentially condemning the debtor family to perpetual slavery About one millennium after written debt contracts were created the concept of debt forgiveness appears in the Old Testament called Jubilee Leviticus 25 and in Greek law when Solon introduces Seisachtheia Both of these historical examples of debt forgiveness involved freeing children from slavery caused by their parents debt While slavery is illegal in all countries today North Korea has a policy called Three Generations of Punishment which has been documented by Shin Donghyuk and used as a moral paragon of punishing children for parents mistakes Stanley Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada have applied this concept calling it Generational Theft to the large increase in government debt being left by the Baby Boomers to their children Investment management In the context of institutional investment management intergenerational equity is the principle that an endowed institutions spending rate must not exceed its afterinflation rate of compound return so that investment gains are spent equally on current and future constituents of the endowed assets This concept was originally set out in 1974 by economist James Tobin who wrote that The trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present Their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations in terms of an economical context Intergenerational equity refers to relationship that a particular family has on resources An example is the forestdwelling civilians in Papua New Guinea who for generations have lived in a certain part of the forest and thus becomes their land The adult population sell the trees for palm oil to make money If they cannot make a sustainable development on managing their resources their next or future generations will lose this resources US national debt See also National debt of the United States One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity For example if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations There are several factors to consider For every dollar of debt held by the public there is a government obligation generally marketable Treasury securities counted as an asset by investors Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them which by definition must correspond to the level of debt passed on As of 2010 approximately 72 of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5 of the population This presents a wealth and income distribution question as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today To the extent the US debt is owed to foreign investors approximately half the debt held by the public during 2012 principal and interest are not directly received by US heirs Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments which create costs for future taxpayers eg higher taxes lower government benefits higher inflation or increased risk of fiscal crisis To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the longterm productivity of the economy and its workers such as via useful infrastructure projects future generations may benefit For every dollar of intragovernmental debt there is an obligation to specific program recipients generally nonmarketable securities such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations via higher taxes or lower program spending Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt Fiscal policy is indeed a moral issue and we should be ashamed of what we’re doing to the next generations economic prospects But our sin involves investing too little not borrowing too much Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result Teacher jobs have been cut which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans Australian politician Christine Milne made similar statements in the lead up to the 2014 Carbon Price Repeal Bill naming the Liberal National Party elected to parliament in 2013 and inherently its ministers as intergenerational thieves her statement was based on the partys attempts to roll back progressive carbon tax policy and the impact this would have on the intergenerational equity of future generations Environmentalism usage Conversations about intergenerational equity occur across several fields They include transition economics social policy and government budgetmaking Intergenerational equity is also explored in environmental concerns including sustainable development global warming and climate change Social justice usage Conversations about intergenerational equity are also relevant to social justice arenas as well where issues such as health care are equal in importance to youth rights and youth voice are pressing and urgent There is a strong interest within the legal community towards the application of intergenerational equity in law Advocacy groups Generation Squeeze is a Canadian notforprofit organization that advocates for intergenerational equity See also Adultism Ageism Environmental ethics
