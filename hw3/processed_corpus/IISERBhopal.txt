 Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal Hindi भारतीय विज्ञान शिक्षा और अनुसंधान संस्थान भोपाल IISERB also referred as IISER Bhopal is an autonomous research and education institute in Bhauri Bhopal district Madhya Pradesh India It was established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development Government of India in 2008 in order to incorporate research in basic science at undergraduate and graduate level with equal emphasis on higher education for research and education in science It is an autonomous institution awarding its own degrees Background Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research IISERs were created in 2006 through a proclamation of Ministry of Human Resource Development Government of Indiaunder the category of institiutes of national importance to promote quality education and research in basic sciences Soon after the announcement two of these institutes at Pune and Kolkata respectively were started in 2006 This was followed by an institute at Mohali 2007 and at Bhopal and Trivandrum in 2008 Each IISER is a degree granting autonomous institution with a prime focus to integrate science education and research Academics IISER Bhopal offer BSMS Dual Degree programme Integrated PhD programme in Chemistry Mathemetics and Physics and PhD programme in Biological Sciences Chemistry Earth and Environmental Sciences Mathematics Physics

Dual Degree Integrated PhD and PhD programme Physics Department of Physics of IISER Bhopal offers BSMS dualdegree PhD degree as well postdoctoral positions The BSMS course is a fiveyear program Earth and Environment Sciences The Department of Earth and Environment Sciences at IISER Bhopal currently offers BSMS Dual Degree and PhD programme Engineering Sciences IISER Bhopal is the first IISER to establish Engineering Sciences Presently the Engineering Sciences has two independent departments Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering Computer Science The key idea is to impart a broad knowledge of basic sciences and specialized knowledge of one of the engineering disciplines The Engineering Sciences is specifically interested in developing programs that will enhance the industryacademia interactions attract support from national and international organizations to conduct research in frontier areas and have an interdisciplinary learning and research ambience at IISER Bhopal Currently both the engineering science departments offer full fledged PhD programmes The students seeking admission in PhD programme in any one of the engineering disciplines should have a master’s degree after GATE qualification in engineering from any reputed institutes approved by AICTE During the programme the students undergo vigorous coursework in advanced engineering topics followed by a research project as their PhD Thesis The institute will be offering five years undergraduate BSMS dual degree programme in Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Computer Science commencing from August 2017 which will provide the students with a unique opportunity to understand and gain the knowledge to pursue an academic career in engineering sciences along with natural science The eligibility criteria for admission in BSMS dual degree programme will be the same as the existing criteria for IISER Bhopal The curriculum of the BSMS programme in engineering disciplines will be interdisciplinary in nature This will allow the graduates from these programmes to pursue careers in the fields that lie at the interfaces between natural and applied sciences The Engineering Science Departments also offer minor in Engineering Sciences to BSMS students majoring in natural sciences This programme is intended to BSMS students after completion of their second year ie 4th semester In the first two years students learn natural sciences such as chemistry mathematics biology physics earth and environmental sciences along with other basic applied science courses and clear the fundamental concepts After the 4th semester students are offered to take minor courses of their own choice The final year students along with the courses can also undertake a project in any one of the engineering disciplines with a faculty member which is evaluated by a committee Admissions BSMS Dual Degree Students are admitted to the programme through the
