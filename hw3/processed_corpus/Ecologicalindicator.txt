 Ecological indicators are used to communicate information about ecosystems and the impact human activity has on ecosystems to groups such as the public or government policy makers Ecosystems are complex and ecological indicators can help describe them in simpler terms that can be understood and used by nonscientists to make management decisions For example the number of different beetle taxa found in a field can be used as an indicator of biodiversity Many different types of indicators have been developed They can be used to reflect a variety of aspects of ecosystems including biological chemical and physical Due to this variety the development and selection of ecological indicators is a complex process Using ecological indicators is a pragmatic approach since direct documentation of changes in ecosystems as related to management measures is cost and time intensive For example it would be expensive and timeconsuming to count every bird plant and animal in a newly restored wetland to see if the restoration was a success Instead a few indicator species can be monitored to determine success of the restoration The terms ecological indicator and environmental indicator are often used interchangeably However ecological indicators are actually a subset of environmental indicators Generally environmental indicators provide information on pressures on the environment environmental conditions and societal responses Ecological indicators refer only to ecological processes  Policy evaluation Ecological indicators play an important role in evaluating policy regarding the environment Contributions Indicators contribute to evaluation of policy development by Providing decisionmakers and the general public with relevant information on the current state and trends in the environment Helping decisionmakers better understand cause and effect relationships between the choices and practices of businesses and policymakers versus the environment Assisting to monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to increase and enhance ecological goods and services Based on the United Nations convention to combat desertification and convention for biodiversity indicators are planned to be built in order to evaluate the evolution of the factors For instance for the CCD the Unescofunded Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel OSS has created the Réseau dObservatoires du Sahara et du Sahel ROSELT website 9 as a network of crossSaharan observatories to establish ecological indicators Limitations There are limitations and challenges to using indicators for evaluating policy programs For indicators to be useful for policy analysis it is necessary to be able to use and compare indicator results on different scales local regional national and international Currently indicators face the following spatial limitations and challenges Variable availability of data and information on local regional and national scales Lack of methodological standards on an international scale Different ranking of indicators on an international scale which can result in different legal treatment Averaged values across a national level may hide regional and local trends When compiled local indicators may be too diverse to provide a national result Indicators also face other limitations and challenges such as Lack of reference levels therefore it is unknown if trends in environmental change are strong or weak Indicator measures can overlap causing over estimation of single parameters Longterm monitoring is necessary to identify longterm environmental changes Attention to more easily handled measurable indicators distracts from indicators less quantifiable such as aesthetics ethics or cultural values See also Ecological science
