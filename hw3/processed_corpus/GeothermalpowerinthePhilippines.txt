 The Geothermal Education Office and a 1980 article titled The Philippines geothermal success story by Rudolph J Birsic published in the journal Geothermal Energy note the remarkable geothermal resources of the Philippines During the World Geothermal Congress 2000 held in Beppu ÅŒita Prefecture of Japan held from May to June 2000 it was reported that the Philippines is the largest consumer of electricity from geothermal sources and highlighted the potential role of geothermal energy in providing energy needs for developing countries According to the International Geothermal Association IGA worldwide the Philippines ranks second to the United States in producing geothermal energy As of 2010 the US had a capacity of 3093 megawatts of geothermal power while that of the Philippines was 1904 megawatts The Philippines was followed by Mexico with 958 MW Early statistics from the Institute for Green Resources and Environment stated that Philippine geothermal energy provides 16 of the countrys electricity By 2005 geothermal energy accounted for 175 of the countrys electricity production More recent statistics from the IGA show that combined energy from the nations six geothermal fields located in the islands of Luzon Leyte Negros and Mindanao still accounts for approximately 17 of the countrys electricity generation Leyte island is where the first geothermal power plant a 3 megawatt wellhead unit started operations in July 1977 Largerscale commercial production of geothermal power began in 1979 with the commissioning of a 110megawatt plant at Tiwi field in Albay province IGA figures as of December 2009 show the nations installed geothermal capacity stands at 1904 megawatts with gross generation of 10311 gigawatthrs for all of 2009 representing 17 of the nations total power generation mix See also Renewable energy in the Philippines Wind power in the Philippines List of Geothermal power plants in the Philippines References
