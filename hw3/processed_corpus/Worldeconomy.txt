 The world economy or global economy is the economy of the world considered as the international exchange of goods and services that is expressed in monetary units of account money In some contexts the two terms are distinguished the international or global economy being measured separately and distinguished from national economies while the world economy is simply an aggregate of the separate countries measurements Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production use and exchange the definitions representations models and valuations of the world economy vary widely It is inseparable from the geography and ecology of Earth It is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to human economic activity and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services or in cases in which a lack of independent research or government cooperation makes establishing figures difficult Typical examples are illegal drugs and other black market goods which by any standard are a part of the world economy but for which there is by definition no legal market of any kind However even in cases in which there is a clear and efficient market to establish a monetary value economists do not typically use the current or official exchange rate to translate the monetary units of this market into a single unit for the world economy since exchange rates typically do not closely reflect worldwide value for example in cases where the volume or price of transactions is closely regulated by the government Rather market valuations in a local currency are typically translated to a single monetary unit using the idea of purchasing power This is the method used below which is used for estimating worldwide economic activity in terms of real US dollars or euros However the world economy can be evaluated and expressed in many more ways It is unclear for example how many of the worlds 713 billion people have most of their economic activity reflected in these valuations As of 2015 the following 13 countries or regions have reached an economy of at least US2 trillion by
