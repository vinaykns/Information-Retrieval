 The country and Rural redirect here For other uses see Country disambiguation and Rural disambiguation In general a rural area or countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities The Health Resources and Services Administration of the US Department of Health and Human Services defines the word rural as encompassing all population housing and territory not included within an urban area Whatever is not urban is considered rural Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements Agricultural areas are commonly rural though so are others such as forests Different countries have varying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes North America Canada In Canada the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development defines a predominantly rural region as having more than 50 of the population living in rural communities where a rural community has a population density less than 150 people per square kilometre In Canada the census division has been used to represent regions and census consolidated subdivisions have been used to represent communities Intermediate regions have 15 to 49 percent of their population living in a rural community Predominantly urban regions have less than 15 percent of their population living in a rural community Predominantly rural regions are classified as rural metroadjacent rural nonmetroadjacent and rural northern following Ehrensaft and Beeman 1992 Rural metroadjacent regions are predominantly rural census divisions which are adjacent to metropolitan centres while rural nonmetroadjacent regions are those predominantly rural census divisions which are not adjacent to metropolitan centres Rural northern regions are predominantly rural census divisions that are found either entirely or mostly above the following lines of parallel in each province Newfoundland and Labrador 50th Quebec 54Ontario 54th Manitoba 53rd Saskatchewan Alberta and British Columbia 54th As well rural northern regions encompass all of the Yukon Northwest Territories and Nunavut Statistics Canada defines rural for their population counts This definition has changed over time see Appendix A in du Plessis et al 2002 Typically it has referred to the population living outside settlements of 1000 or less inhabitants The current definition states that census rural is the population outside settlements with fewer than 1000 inhabitants and a population density below 400 people per square kilometre Statistics Canada 2007 United States Main article Rural America 84 of the United States inhabitants live in suburban and urban areas but cities occupy only 10 percent of the country Rural areas villages occupy the remaining 90 percent The US Census Bureau the USDAs Economic Research Service and the Office of Management and Budget OMB have come together to help define rural areas United States Census Bureau The Census Bureau definitions new to the 2000 census which are based on population density defines rural areas as all territory outside of Census Bureaudefined urbanized areas and urban clusters An urbanized area consists of a central surrounding areas whose population urban nucleus is greater than 50000 They may or may not contain individual cities with 50000 or more rather they must have a core with a population density generally exceeding 1000 persons per square mile and may contain adjoining territory with at least 500 persons per square mile other towns outside of an urbanized area whose population exceeds 2500 Thus rural areas comprise open country and settlements with fewer than 2500 residents areas designated as rural can have population densities as high as 999 per square mile or as low as 1 person per square mile USDA The USDAs Office of Rural Development may define rural by various population thresholds The 2002 farm bill PL 107171 Sec 6020 defined rural and rural area as any area other than 1 a city or town that has a population of greater than 50000 inhabitants and 2 the urbanized areas contiguous and adjacent to such a city or town The ruralurban continuum codes urban influence code and rural county typology codes developed by USDA’s Economic Research Service ERS allow researchers to break out the standard metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas into smaller residential groups For example a metropolitan county is one that contains an urbanized area or one that has a twentyfive percent commuter rate to an urbanized area regardless of population OMB Under the Core Based Statistical Areas used by the OMB commonly referred to as CBSA Codes a metropolitan county or Metropolitan Statistical AreaMSA consists of 1 central counties with one or more urbanized areas as defined by the Census Bureau and 2 outlying counties that are economically tied to the core counties as measured by worker commuting data ie if 25 of workers living there commute to the core counties or if 25 of the employment in the county consists of workers coming from the central counties Nonmetro counties are outside the boundaries of metro areas and are further subdivided into Micropolitan Statistical Areas centered on urban clusters of 10000–50000 residents and all remaining noncore counties In 2014 the USDA updated their rural nonrural area definitions based on the 2010 Census counts Rural schools National Center for Education Statistics NCES revised its definition of rural schools in 2006 after working with the Census Bureau to create a new locale classification system to capitalize on improved geocoding technology Rural health Rural health definitions can be different for establishing underserved areas or health care accessibility in rural areas of the United States According to the handbook Definitions of Rural A Handbook for Health Policy Makers and Researchers Residents of metropolitan counties are generally thought to have easy access to the relatively concentrated health services of the countys central areas However some metropolitan counties are so large that they contain small towns and rural sparsely populated areas that are isolated from these central clusters and their corresponding health services by physical barriers To address this type of rural area Harold Goldsmith Dena Puskin and Dianne Stiles 1992 described a methodology to identify small towns and rural areas within large metropolitan counties LMCs that were isolated from central areas by distance or other physical features This became the Goldsmith Modification definition of rural Bhoomeet rural education The Goldsmith Modification has been useful for expanding the eligibility for federal programs that assist rural populations—to include the isolated rural populations of large metropolitan counties Health care delivery in rural areas of the United States can be challenging From 20052011 the rate of potentially preventable hospitalizations for acute conditions was highest in rural areas as compared to large metropolitan small metropolitan or micropolitan areas South America Brazil In Brazil theres different notions of rural area and countryside Rural areas are any place outside a municipalitys urban development buildings streets and its carried by informal usage Otherwise countryside interior in Portuguese are officially defined as all municipalities outside the stateterritory capitals metropolitan region Some states as Mato Grosso do Sul doesnt have any metropolitan region thus all of the state except its capital is officially countryside Rio de Janeiro is singular in Brazil and its de facto a metropolitan state as circa 70 of its population are located in Greater Rio In the Federal District its not applicable and theres no countryside as all of it is treated as the federal capital Brasília is nominally the capital but the capitality is shared through all Federal District because Brazil de facto defines its capital as a municipality and in municipal matters the Federal District is treated and governs as a single municipality citystatelike Brasília DF Europe Germany The country is divided into 402 administrative districts 295 rural districts and 107 urban districts Germany is among the largest agricultural producers in the European Union More than half of Germanys territory – almost 19 million hectares – is used for farming and are located in the rural areas Almost 10 of employees in Germany has work linked directly or indirectly with the agricultural forest and fisheries sectors approximately a fifth of them are employed in primary production The implication is that unlike in some other European countries where rural areas are known for being backward when compared to urban areas in Germany the trend is changing Due to the countrys policy of equal living conditions this is not the case in Germany Rural areas receive nearly equivalent attention as the urban areas do Also through a special approach to rural development usually referred to as Village Renewal the challenges of rural Germany are taken care of Ireland Ireland is a very rural country with several urban centres Agriculture is an important part of the countrys economy The varied landscape includes bogland meadows hills and mountains United Kingdom In Britain rural is defined by the government Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA using population data from the latest census such as the United Kingdom Census 2001 These definitions have various grades but the upper point is any local government area with less than 26 of its population living in a market town market town being defined as any settlement which has permission to hold a street market A number of measures are in place to protect the British countryside including green belts Rural health In England an NHS patient is defined as rural if they live more than 16 km 1 mi from either a doctor or a dispensing chemist In Scotland a different definition of rural is used This is important for defining whether the patient is expected to collect their own medicines While doctors surgeries in towns will not have a medicines dispensary instead expecting patients to use a highstreet chemist to purchase their prescription medicines in Scotland collection not purchase as prescriptions are paid by the state in rural village surgeries an NHS medicines dispensary will be built into the same building Asia India Rural areas are also known as the countryside or a village in India It has a very low population density In rural areas agriculture is the chief source of livelihood along with fishing cottage industries pottery etc The quest to discover the real rural India still continues in great earnest Almost every economic agency today has a definition of rural India Here are a few definitions According to the Planning Commission a town with a maximum population of 15000 is considered rural in nature In these areas the panchayat makes all the decisions There are five persons in the panchayat The National Sample Survey Organisation NSSO defines ‘rural’ as follows An area with a population density of up to 400 per square kilometer Villages with clear surveyed boundaries but no municipal board A minimum of 75 of male working population involved in agriculture and allied activities RBI defines rural areas as those areas with a population of less than 49000 tier 3 to tier6 cities It is generally said that the rural areas house up to 70 of India’s population Rural India contributes a large chunk to India’s GDP by way of agriculture selfemployment services construction etc As per a strict measure used by the National Sample Survey in its 63rd round called monthly per capita expenditure rural expenditure accounts for 55 of total national monthly expenditure The rural population currently accounts for onethird of the total Indian FMCG sales Human fertility Rural residence is a fertility factor with total fertility rates and pregnancy being higher among women in rural areas than among women in urban areas and the rural population is much younger than urban areas See also American Old West Boondocks Country house
