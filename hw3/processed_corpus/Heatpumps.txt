 A heat pump is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one A heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink While air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps the term heat pump is more general and applies to many HVAC heating ventilating and air conditioning devices used for space heating or space cooling When a heat pump is used for heating it employs the same basic refrigerationtype cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator but in the opposite direction releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment In this use heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground In heating mode heat pumps are three to four times more effective at heating than simple electrical resistance heaters using the same amount of electricity Typically installed cost for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than for resistance heaters Overview Main article Heat pump and refrigeration cycle Heat energy naturally transfers from warmer places to colder spaces However a heat pump can reverse this by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one Heat is not conserved in this process and requires some amount of external energy such as electricity In heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems the term heat pump usually refers to vaporcompression refrigeration devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer These heat pumps can be reversible and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space Heat pumps are used to transfer heat because less highgrade energy is required than is released as heat Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment only a fraction of which comes from electricity or some other highgrade energy source required to run a compressor In electricallypowered heat pumps the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed giving the system a coefficient of performance COP of 3 or 4 as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy Heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes in the evaporator and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses in the condenser The refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances Reversible heat pumps Reversible heat pumps work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space They employ a reversing valve to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils In heating mode the outdoor coil is an evaporator while the indoor is a condenser The refrigerant flowing from the evaporator outdoor coil carries the thermal energy from outside air or soil indoors Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy including energy from the compression to the indoor air which is then moved around the inside of the building by an air handler Alternatively thermal energy is transferred to water which is then used to heat the building via radiators or underfloor heating The heated water may also be used for domestic hot water consumption The refrigerant is then allowed to expand cool and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator and the cycle repeats This is a standard refrigeration cycle save that the cold side of the refrigerator the evaporator coil is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder In cold weather the outdoor unit of an air source heat pump needs to be intermittently defrosted This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements located in the airhandler to be activated At the same time the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant The condenserevaporator fan will not run during defrost mode In cooling mode the cycle is similar but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil which reaches a lower temperature is the evaporator This is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate History Milestones 1748 William Cullen demonstrates artificial refrigeration 1834 Jacob Perkins builds a practical refrigerator with diethyl ether 1852 Lord Kelvin describes the theory underlying heat pump 1855–1857 Peter von Rittinger develops and builds the first heat pump 1948 Robert C Webber is credited as developing and building the first ground heat pump Operating principles Mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and condensing fluid known as a refrigerant The heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed The working fluid in its gaseous state is pressurized and circulated through the system by a compressor On the discharge side of the compressor the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger called a condenser until it condenses into a high pressure moderate temperature liquid The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressurelowering device also called a metering device This may be an expansion valve capillary tube or possibly a workextracting device such as a turbine The lowpressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger the evaporator in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated It is essential that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature when compressed to release heat through the hot heat exchanger the condenser Similarly the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger the evaporator In particular the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side The greater the temperature difference the greater the required pressure difference and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid Thus as with all heat pumps the coefficient of performance amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required decreases with increasing temperature difference Insulation is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled Heat transport Heat is typically transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid Air is sometimes used but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat In systems using refrigerant this working fluid can also be used to transfer heat a considerable distance though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage When large amounts of heat are to be transferred water is typically used often supplemented with antifreeze corrosion inhibitors and other additives Heat sourcessinks A common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air as used by an airsource heat pump A fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency Larger installations handling more heat or in tight physical spaces often use watersource heat pumps The heat is sourced or rejected in water flow which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct crosssection than air flow can carry The water may be heated at a remote location by boilers solar energy or other means Alternatively when needed the water may be cooled by using a cooling tower or discharged into a large body of water such as a lake stream or an ocean Geothermal heat pumps or groundsource heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink and water as the heat transfer medium This is possible because below ground level the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat Ground source heat pumps work in the same way as airsource heat pumps but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground Ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost the annual running costs are lower because welldesigned ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter Heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters or oil or gas combustion The auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads or to provide a backup system Applications There are millions of domestic installations using air source heat pumps They are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs HVAC and may also provide domestic hot water The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates HVAC In HVAC applications a heat pump is typically a vaporcompression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow thermal energy movement may be reversed The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building In cooler climates the default setting of the reversing valve is heating The default setting in warmer climates is cooling Because of the two heat exchangers the condenser and evaporator must swap functions they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes Therefore the SEER rating which is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines For equipment to receive the Energy Star Rating it must have a rating of at least 145 SEER Water heating In water heating applications a heat pump may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or heating potable water for use by homes and industry Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank another variety extracts heat from indoor air to assist in cooling the space District heating Main article Drammen Heat Pump Commissioned in 2011 this district heating extracts heat from a fjord whose temperature is around 8 °C using 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 megawatts to town center residences and businesses A city ordinance mandates this heating system for many new buildings Refrigerants Until the 1990s the refrigerants were often chlorofluorocarbons such as R12 dichlorodifluoromethane one in a class of several refrigerants using the brand name Freon a trademark of DuPont Its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987 because of the damage that CFCs cause to the ozone layer if released into the atmosphere One widely adopted replacement refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon HFC known as R134a 1112tetrafluoroethane Heat pumps using R134a replaced R12 dichlorodifluoromethane and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant ozone depletion potential and a somewhat lower global warming potential Other substances such as liquid R717 ammonia are widely used in largescale systems or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane can also be used Since 2001 carbon dioxide R744 has increasingly been used utilizing the transcritical cycle although it requires much higher working pressures In residential and commercial applications the hydrochlorofluorocarbon HCFC R22 is still widely used however HFC R410A does not deplete the ozone layer and is being used more frequently however it is a powerful greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change Hydrogen helium nitrogen or plain air is used in the Stirling cycle providing the maximum number of options in environmentally friendly gases More recent refrigerators use R600A which is isobutane and does not deplete the ozone and is less harmful to the environment Dimethyl ether DME has also gained in popularity as a refrigerant Noise A ground source heat pump has no need for an outdoor unit with moving mechanical components no external noise is produced An air source heat pump requires an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise In 2013 the CEN started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units Although the CENTC 113 Business Plan outset was that consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by January 2016 In the United States the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as an average 24hr exposure limit of 55 Aweighted decibels dBA to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas US EPA 1974 This limit is a day–night 24hr average noise level LDN with a 10dBA penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels The 10dBA penalty makes the permitted US nighttime noise level equal to 45 dBA which is more than is accepted in some European countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps Another feature of ASHP external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode After that the heat pump starts to work again This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan The acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA This is included in legislation in France According to the French concept of noise nuisance noise emergence is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise and ambient noise without the disturbing noise Performance Considerations When comparing the performance of heat pumps it is best to avoid the word efficiency which has a very specific thermodynamic definition The term coefficient of performance COP is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input Most vaporcompression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input According to the US EPA geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44 compared with airsource heat pumps and up to 72 compared with electric resistance heating The COP for heat pumps range from 32 to 45 for air source heat pumps to 42 to 52 for ground source heat pumps When used for heating a building with an outside temperature of for example 10 °C a typical airsource heat pump ASHP has a COP of 3 to 4 whereas an electrical resistance heater has a COP of 10 That is one joule of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat while under ideal conditions one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place Note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs the COP is lower worse In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 10 On the other hand well designed groundsource heat pump GSHP systems benefit from the moderate temperature underground as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy Their yearround COP is therefore normally in the range of 32 to 50 When there is a high temperature differential eg when an airsource heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of say 0 °C 32 °F it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day Ultimately due to Carnot efficiency limits the heat pumps performance will decrease as the outdoortoindoor temperature difference increases outside temperature gets colder reaching a theoretical limit of 10 at −273 °C In practice a COP of 10 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18 °C 0 °F for air source heat pumps Also as the heat pump takes heat out of the air some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger The system must periodically melt this ice this defrosting translates into an additional energy electricity expenditure When it is extremely cold outside it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source such as an electric resistance heater oil furnace or gas furnace rather than to run an airsource heat pump Also avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machines compressor The design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential between the refrigerant and the air stream directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect Generally the larger the heat exchanger the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes Heat exchangers are expensive requiring drilling for some heatpump types or large spaces to be efficient and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency Heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment not longterm savings compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards Electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps In cooling mode a heat pumps operating performance is described in the US as its energy efficiency ratio EER or seasonal energy efficiency ratio SEER and both measures have units of BTUh·W 1 BTUh·W  0293 WW A larger EER number indicates better performance The manufacturers literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode Actual performance varies however and depends on many factors such as installation details temperature differences site elevation and maintenance As with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils the efficiency of the unit both in heating and cooling modes will suffer Heat pumps are more effective for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal This is because the compressors input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space But for cooling the condenser is normally outdoors and the compressors dissipated work waste heat must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy rather than being put to a useful purpose For the same reason opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air This heat includes the compressors dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance The COP for a heat pump in a heating or cooling application with steadystate operation is where Δ Q cool displaystyle Delta Qtextcool is the amount of heat extracted from a cold reservoir at temperature T cool displaystyle Ttextcool Δ Q hot displaystyle Delta Qtexthot is the amount of heat delivered to a hot reservoir at temperature T hot displaystyle Ttexthot Δ A displaystyle Delta A is the compressors dissipated work All temperatures are absolute temperatures usually measured in kelvins or degrees Rankine Coefficient of performance COP and lift The COP increases as the temperature difference or lift decreases between heat source and destination The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature eg underfloor heating and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature eg the ground Domestic hot water DHW and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures reducing the COP that can be attained and affecting the choice of heat pump technology One observation is that while current best practice heat pumps ground source system operating between 0 °C and 35 °C have a typical COP around 4 no better than 5 the maximum achievable is 88 because of fundamental Carnot cycle limits This means that in the coming decades the energy efficiency of topend heat pumps could roughly double Cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better gas compressor fitting HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows and solving internal lubrication problems resulting from slower gas flow Depending on the working fluid the expansion stage can be important also Work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power An evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole but an ideal gas is not Types Compression vs absorption The two main types of heat pumps are compression and absorption Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy typically driven by electricity while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source from electricity or burnable fuels An absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or LP gas for example While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed may average only 15 that is better than a natural gas or LP gas furnace which can only approach 1 Heat sources and sinks By definition all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated Most commonly heat pumps draw heat from the air outside or inside air or from the ground groundwater or soil The heat drawn from groundsourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat and it should not be confused with direct geothermal heating though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground True geothermal heat when used for heating requires a circulation pump but no heat pump since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated so the technology relies only upon simple heat convection Other heat sources for heat pumps include water nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used and sometimes domestic waste water via drain water heat recovery which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated A number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings Air ASHP Main article Air source heat pumps Air source heat pump extracts heat from outside air Air–air heat pump transfers heat to inside air Air–water heat pump transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water Airair heat pumps that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest These are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse Airwater heat pumps are otherwise similar to airair heat pumps but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit floor heating being the most efficient and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building However groundwater heat pumps are more efficient than airwater heat pumps and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems Air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type However they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency In mild weather COP may be around 40 while at temperatures below around 0 °C 32 °F an airsource heat pump may still achieve a COP of 25 The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2528 with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates The heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps and hence their energy efficiency still declines dramatically as the temperature drops but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps as shown in the following table temperatures are approximate and may vary by manufacturer and model Ground GSHP Main article Groundsource heat pump Ground source heat pump extracts heat from the ground or similar sources Ground–air heat pump transfers heat to inside air Soil–air heat pump soil as a source of heat Rock–air heat pump rock as a source of heat Water–air heat pump body of water as a source of heat can be groundwater lake river etc Ground–water heat pump transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water Soil–water heat pump ground as a source of heat Rock–water heat pump rock as a source of heat Water–water heat pump body of water as a source of heat Groundsource heat pumps also called geothermal heat pumps typically have higher efficiencies than airsource heat pumps This is because they draw heat from the ground or groundwater which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet 9 m This means that the temperature differential is lower leading to higher efficiency Well maintained groundsource heat pumps typically have COPs of 40 at the beginning of the heating season with lower seasonal COPs of around 30 as heat is drawn from the ground The tradeoff for this improved performance is that a groundsource heat pump is more expensive to install due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid water with a little antifreeze When compared groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a typical worst case cold spell or is simply undersized for the load One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop one way is to make large solar collectors for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized by ensuring soil thermal properties and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design Exhaust air EAHP Main article Exhaust air heat pump Exhaust air heat pump extracts heat from the exhaust air of a building requires mechanical ventilation Exhaust airair heat pump transfers heat to intake air Exhaust airwater heat pump transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water Water source heat pumps WSHP Uses flowing water as source or sink for heat Singlepass vs recirculation Singlepass — water source is a body of water or a stream and utilized water is rejected at a different temperature without further use Recirculation When cooling closedloop heat transfer medium to central cooling tower or chiller typically in a building or industrial setting When heating closedloop heat transfer medium from central boilers generating heat from combustion or other sources Hybrid HHP Hybrid or twin source heat pumps when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 Celsius 4050 Fahrenheit depending on ground water temperature they use air when air is colder they use the ground source These twin source systems can also store summer heat by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heaterexchanger even when the heat pump itself is not running This has dual advantage it functions as a low running cost for air cooling and if ground water is relatively stagnant it cranks up the temperature of the ground source which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4 for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source Airwaterbrinewater heat pump hybrid heat pump The airwaterbrinewater heat pump is a hybrid heat pump developed in Rostock Germany that uses only renewable energy sources Unlike other hybrid systems which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device The airwaterbrinewater heat pump has two evaporators — an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator — both connected to the heat pump cycle This allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions for example air temperature The unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode — air or geothermal heat or both together The process is controlled by a control unit which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system The control unit comprises two controllers one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation in one device All components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the airwaterbrinewater heat pump a patent in 2008 under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump” This hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an icestorage It trades and is marketed under the name ThermSelect In the United Kingdom ThermSelect won the 2013 Commercial Heating Product of the Year award of the HVR Awards for Excellence organised by Heating and Ventilating Review an industry magazine Solarassisted heat pump SAHP See also Solarassisted heat pump A SAHP is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system Typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pumps evaporator The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way Solid state heat pumps Magnetic Main article Magnetic refrigeration In 1881 the German physicist Emil Warburg put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature Some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway claiming to cut energy consumption by 40 compared to current domestic refrigerators The process works as follows Powdered gadolinium is moved into a magnetic field heating the material by 2 to 5 °C 4 to 9 °F The heat is removed by a circulating fluid The material is then moved out of the magnetic field reducing its temperature below its starting temperature Thermoelectric Main articles Thermoelectric cooling and Thermoelectric materials Solid state heat pumps using the thermoelectric effect have improved over time to the point where they are useful for certain refrigeration tasks Thermoelectric Peltier heat pumps are generally only around 1015 as efficient as the ideal refrigerator Carnot cycle compared with 40–60 achieved by conventional compression cycle systems reverse Rankine systems using compressionexpansion however this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science A reason why this is popular is because it has a long lifetime as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants Thermoacoustic Main
