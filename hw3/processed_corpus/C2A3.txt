similarly named currencies such as the Gibraltar pound or occasionally the Syrian pound It is also sometimes used for currencies named lira for example the now withdrawn Italian lira and on rare occasion the Turkish lira The symbol derives from a capital L representing libra the basic unit of weight in the Roman Empire which in turn is derived from the Latin name of the same spelling for scales or a balance The pound became an English unit of weight and was so named because it originally had the value of one tower pound 350 grams of fine pure silver The pound sign is placed before the number eg £12000 and separated from the following digits by no space or only a thin space The symbol ₤ was called the lira sign in Italy before the adoption of the euro It was used in free variation with £ as an alternative to the more usual Lor Lit to show prices in lire It was also used unofficially as the symbol of the Maltese lira instead of the official Lm In American English the term pound

Unicode notes that the lira sign is not widely used and the preferred sign for lira is the pound sign Some fonts render the pound sign with a double bar for example on a previous version of the British five pound note this is simply a different glyph and the underlying character and therefore Unicode codepoint is still a pound sign and not a lira sign Entry methods Historical Prior to the introduction of the IBM PC there was no unique accepted standard for entering displaying printing or storing the £ sign in the UK computer industry On personal computers prior to the PC the key was often used sometimes it was displayed on screen as but many printers could be set up to print £ where was sent to the printer by an application program Keying in storing displaying and printing the sign often required special setup Although the sign is commonly called the hash symbol it is also referred to as the pound sign in North America though in reference to the unit of weight not the unit of currency It is also known as the number symbol or key The Commodore 64 computer included a dedicated key for the pound sign to the right of the number row The BBC Micro used a variant of ASCII that replaced the backtick character 96 hex 60 with the pound sign ISOIEC 8859 had not yet been standardised and it was advantageous to have commonly used characters available in the lower 7bit ASCII table denoted as CHR96 or hex CHR60 Since the BBC Micro used a Teletext mode as standard this means that the pound sign is in the 7bit ASCII variant used on Teletext systems such as Ceefax ORACLE and Teletext Ltd as well On Latinalphabet typewriters lacking a £ symbol type element a reasonable approximation can be made by typing an f over an L PC On Microsoft Windows Linux and Unix the UK keyboard layout has the £ symbol on the 3 number key and is typed using ⇧ Shift3 On a USInternational keyboard in Windows the £ can be entered using ⇧ ShiftAltGr4 ⇧ ShiftCtrlAlt4 On a USInternational keyboard in Linux and Unix the £ can be entered using Ctrl⇧ ShiftU followed by a 3 ⇧ ShiftAltGr3 In Windows it can also be generated through the Alt keycodes Alt0163 keeping Alt pressed until all 4 digits have been typed on the numeric keypad only Alt6556 Alt156 In MSDOS ⇧ ShiftAlt156 The Character Map utility and Microsoft Words Insert Symbol commands may also be used to enter this character Mac The symbol £ is in the MacRoman character set and can be generated on most nonUK Mac OS keyboard layouts which do not have a dedicated key for it typically through ⌥ Option3 On UK Apple Mac keyboards this is reversed with the £ symbol on the number 3 key typed using ⇧ Shift3 and the number sign generated by ⌥ Option3 Compose key The compose key sequence is ComposeL Currencies that use the pound sign United Kingdom Pound sterling Egypt Egyptian pound Syria Syrian pound Printing In the 1980s the two main standards for the print codes for a pound sign were ASCII 186 for the HP Laserjet and ASCII 156 for most other printers including the IBM Quietwriter and Epson dot matrix printers In order to print a pound sign each word processor needed to be set up individually to print the sign for a particular printer For many word processors a terminate and stay resident program TSR was needed to convert the code generated by the package into the right code for the printer Packages such as WordPerfect had utilities to set up this conversion without needing a TSR See also Ł ł  Latin letter L with stroke Parlophone References William Safire 19910324 On Language Hit the Pound Sign New York
