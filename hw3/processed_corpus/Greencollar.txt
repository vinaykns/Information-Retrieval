 A greencollar worker is a worker who is employed in the environmental sectors of the economy Environmental greencollar workers or green jobs satisfy the demand for green development Generally they implement environmentally conscious design policy and technology to improve conservation and sustainability Formal environmental regulations as well as informal social expectations are pushing many firms to seek professionals with expertise with environmental energy efficiency and clean renewable energy issues They often seek to make their output more sustainable and thus more favorable to public opinion governmental regulation and the Earths ecology Green collar workers include professionals such as conservation movement workers environmental consultants council environmental

to make them more energy efficient or other workers involved in clean renewable sustainable future energy development There is a growing movement to incorporate social responsibility within the green industries A sustainable green economy simultaneously values the importance of natural resources and inclusive equitable and healthy opportunities for all communities In the context of the current world economic crisis many experts now argue that a massive push to develop renewable sources of energy could create millions of new jobs and help the economy recover while simultaneously improving the environment increasing labour conditions in poor economies and strengthening energy and food security Notable uses Of or pertaining to both employment and the environment or environmentalism 1976

climate protection Al Gore states that economists across the spectrum — including Martin Feldstein and Lawrence Summers — agree that large and rapid investments in a jobsintensive infrastructure initiative is the best way to revive the economy in a quick and sustainable way Center for American Progress A report from the Center for American Progress concludes that a 100 billion federal investment in clean energy technologies over 2009 and 2010 would yield 2 million new US jobs cutting the unemployment rate by 13 and put the nation on a path toward a lowcarbon economy The report prepared by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst proposes 50 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency retrofits and renewable energy systems 46 billion in direct government spending for public building retrofits mass transit freight rail smart electrical grid systems and renewable energy systems and 4 billion for federal loan guarantees to help finance building retrofits and renewable energy projects The Center believes that clean energy investments would yield about 300000 more jobs than if the same funds were distributed among US taxpayers The clean energy investments would also have the added benefits of lower home energy bills and reduced prices for nonrenewable energy sources due to the reduced consumption of those energy sources Worldwatch Institute UNEP Global efforts to tackle climate change could result in millions of green jobs over the coming decades according to a 2008 study prepared by the Worldwatch Institute with funding from the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP The study found that the global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from 137 trillion per year at present to 274 trillion by 2020 with half of that market in efficient energy use In terms of energy supply the renewable energy industry will be particularly important Some 23 million people have found renewable energy jobs in recent years and projected investments of 630 billion by 2030 would translate into at least 20 million additional jobs US Conference of Mayors Also in 2008 the US Conference of Mayors released a report that finds the US economy currently generates more than 750000 green jobs while over the next 30 years an emphasis on clean energy could result in a fivefold increase to more than 42 million jobs Engineering legal research and consulting jobs currently dominate the green jobs in the United States and could grow by 14 million by 2038 while renewable electricity production will create 123 million jobs alternative transportation fuels will add 15 million jobs and building retrofits will create another 81000 jobs The report notes that most of todays jobs are in metropolitan areas led by New York City Washington DC Houston Texas and Los Angeles California Scientific environmental and health justifications for green collar jobs The Swedish utility Vattenfall did a study of full life cycle emissions of Nuclear Hydro Coal Gas Solar Cell Peat and Wind which the utility uses to produce electricity The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 33 grams of carbon dioxide per KWHr of produced power This compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal according to this study The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO2 of any of their electricity sources Claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste A 2004 article from the BBC states The World Health Organization WHO says 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions and 16 million indoors through using solid fuel In the US alone fossil fuel waste kills 20000 people each year A coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage It is estimated that during 1982 US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident In addition fossil fuel waste causes global warming which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes flooding and other weather events The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production In their comparison deaths per TWyr of electricity produced from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower 342 for coal 85 for natural gas and 8 for nuclear Other uses Green collar is used in the Metal
