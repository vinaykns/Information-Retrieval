empirical analysis of social development in Europe especially Eastern Europe and in the Muslim world His research started with a rethinking of dependency theory in the framework of quantitative data and statistical analysis and work on poverty in the leading industrialized countries His doctoral thesis at Salzburg University on The limits to growth theory was dedicated to the empirical analysis of dependency income inequality and social development in up to 40 countries of the world with country studies for Brazil and Yugoslavia Following the logic of trying to identify the structures which block ThirdWorld development in the industrialized countries he then researched on Austrian arms exports to Third World countries based on United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency figures His habilitation thesis focused on multiple regression models of global development based on data from the World Bank and Volker Bornschier as well as the World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators III and tests the relevance of socioliberal approaches to world development already inherent in the writings of classical social democratic development theories in Europe in the 1930s with multiple regression and canonical correlation models This approach was continued and expanded in SocioLiberal Theory of World Development 1993 Later work dealt with Russia and the global Kondratieff cycle the effects of the arms trade on social development especially for the countries of Eastern Europe and the former USSR Militarism will grow in these countries because of the distribution coalition prone environment of periphery socialism In the 1990s Tausch analyzed migration processes and the transformation of postcommunist countries Later work also included studies of the effects of multinational

contradictions of European Union development global Keynesianism and comparative price levels Islamophobia social expenditure and public health research In the last years Tausch’s studies were mainly debated in the fields of Bibliometry and Scientometry China studies environmental studies and studies on unequal exchange European Union studies research on globalization and the international political economy Kondratieff cycles the measurement of poverty and wellbeing Middle East studies and studies about Muslims in Western countries globalization studies in studies on Terrorism and in World Values Survey oriented research Critique Although the concept of unequal exchange as developed by Kohler and Tausch has become one of the standard definitions in world system theory and in critical studies on globalization and sustainable development the Turkish economist Turan Subasat Izmir University recently criticized this concept by saying that international prices are formed in a complex manner and lower international prices for low income countries cannot simply be considered as evidence for unequal exchange The Austrian political scientist Thomas Schmidinger writing in the official journal of the Austrian Political Science Association Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft on Tauschs attempts to measure Muslim opinions in Europe comes to the conclusion Tausch attempts to redress the lack of serious qualitative and quantitative social research by using data from the World Values Survey and the European Social Survey He speaks even of a forensic political science and a forensic sociology p 9 He rightly criticizes that neither the European Union nor the national states in Europe provide adequate resources for such research Really to resolve this lack of data a whole team of longterm research would have been necessary Right here however Tausch shows that he also does not have enough data and therefore his approach as he himself writes in the introduction is forensic Who really wants to get more secure data in the debate on Islam in Europe should invest in a largescale study conducted in a methodologically sound way which should not examine only the Muslim population but also appropriate comparison groups from the nonMuslim population Selected books English Tausch A Prager F 1993 Towards a SocioLiberal Theory of World Development
