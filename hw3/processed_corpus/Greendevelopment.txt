 Green development is a real estate development concept that carefully considers social and environmental impacts of development It is defined by three subcategories environmental responsiveness resource efficiency and community and cultural sensitivity Environmental responsiveness respects the intrinsic value of nature and minimizes damage to an ecosystem Environmental efficiency refers to the use of fewer resources to conserve energy and the environment Community and cultural sensitivity recognizes the unique cultural values that each community hosts and carefully considers them in real estate development unlike more discernable signs of sustainability like solar energy solar panels are more visibly green than the use of local materials Green development manifests itself in various forms however it is generally based on solution multipliers features of a project that provide additional benefits which ultimately reduce the projects’ environmental impacts The above green development concepts have been derived from the allinclusive tome released by The Rocky Mountain Institute entitled Green Development Integrating Ecology and Real Estate History Green development emerged as a result of the environmental movement in the 1970s In real estate however the term commenced in 1897 with a report from the World Commission on Environment and Development entitled Our Common Future The report includes 16 principles of environmental management designed to foster green development It also discusses the traditional model of macroeconomic growth and its disregard for environmental consequences From this initial movement the future experienced a backandforth relationship with green methodologies environmental issues often came second behind purely economic factors Incessant environmental concern and legislation including in real estate development began to emerge ie Green development However a common concern of green development is that it may increase costs and time hence the ongoing argument of whether green strategies can be sustainable as well as economically stimulating National environmental attention has since worked its way down to real estate developers and become an increasing priority Developers today must work within the parameters of legislation that now considers the environmental implications of development Legislation In response to increasing public concern regarding environmental issues the government adopted a series of environmental controls in the real estate market For example in California such legislation included the National Environmental Policy Act the NEPA process the Clean Air Act the Clean Water Act the Coastal Zone Management Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA The National Environmental Policy Act signed in 1970 changed how federal agencies made decisions because it required them to propose environmental analysis before starting a project The Clean Air Act 1970 requires the EPA to set national models for clean air The Clean Water Act 1972 was designed to minimize pollution in natural bodies of water and also to create bodies of water that are clean enough for recreational activities such as fishing or swimming The Coastal Zone Management Act 1972 manages the nations coastal resources such as Great Lakes and estuaries The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA is also known as Superfund It is commonly referred to as Superfund because it comprises two trust funds that provide help to improve areas that have been polluted by hazardous waste The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 allows the government to lien a property that is being cleaned up Additionally the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA is Californias most comprehensive piece of legislation regarding the environment This act applies to all decisions made by cities and counties in California and includes the mandate of an Environmental Impact Report EIR to both public and private projects Subsequently any new real estate development is subject to a detailed environmental analysis before starting a project Californias Senate Bill SB 375 2008 is another piece of legislation that promotes green development It aims to achieve Californias climate goals via more efficient land use and development patterns More specifically SB 375 seeks to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions through close coordination between landuse and transportation One way this is achieved is through demandside measures This strategy would decrease driving demand and therefore reduce vehicle miles traveled VMT and ultimately reduce GHG emissions For example a demandside policy component may include placing public transit stops near development in order to maximize walkability Additionally California state law requires minimum energy conservation levels for all new andor existing development projects The seller of a home is required to include information regarding energy conservation retrofitting and thermal insulation in the sales contract Green Development in Practice Broad Development Patterns Senate Bill 375 demonstrates an urban planning strategy called growth management It is defined by a close coordination between landuse controls and capital investment and heavily motivated by environmental issues It is defined by the regulation of the amount timing location and character of development As the name may suggest growth management may not imply limiting any growth Growth control carries the connotation of managing or limiting growth and no growth would indicate stopping growth all together Moreover Growth Management requires the cooperation of all three of these connotations Urban Growth Boundaries UBGs are popular growth management strategies They are designed to encourage growth within a given boundary and discourage it outside the boundary The goal of the UGB is to promote dense development in order to decrease urban sprawl This growth management technique ultimately seeks to revitalize central cities and create vibrant walkable spaces for community development These clustered development patterns are solution multipliers Reducing demand for infrastructure can save money and resources These multipliers can increase walkability which fosters social interaction and community togetherness Intelligent Building In the US commercial and residential buildings are the highest consumers of electricity and HVAC systems comprise a large portion of this usage In fact the US Department of Energy projects that 70 of the electricity used in the US is from buildings Intelligent Building methods such as Occupancy Detection Systems Wireless Sensor Networks and HVAC Control Systems aim to more efficient energy usage A team of researchers at the University of San Diego project that their smart building automation systems will save 1015 in building energy Case Studies The Holly Street Village Apartments The city of Pasadena has recently adopted a general plan based on seven guiding principles community needs and quality of life preservation of Pasadenas historic character economic vitality a healthy family community lack of need for automobiles promoted as a cultural scientific corporate entertainment and educational center for the region and community participation This project included environmental concern and social considerations in the process of construction The Holly Street Village Apartments in Pasadena address several of the principles outlined in Pasadenas general plan It incorporates mixeduse development with groundfloor retail center including a deli a convenience store and an art gallery Also the Holly Street Village Apartments is located near a light rail station The goal of these strategies is to reduce the demand for automobiles and making it easier for people to use public transportation Inn of the Anazasi Zimmer Associates International a real estate development firm completed the Inn of the Anasazi in Santa Fe New Mexico in 1991 Robert Zimmer cofounder and his partners Steve Conger and Michael Fuller set a goal to construct a building that would showcase energy and resourcesaving technologies strengthen local community offer first class elegance and financially reward its participants The interior design of the hotel pays respect to the ancient Anasazi Indians including locally crafted furniture handmade rugs and Native American Hispanic and cowboy wall art The use of adobe on the exterior of the hotel includes the historic pueblo style Also Zimmer and his partners repurposed a steelframed building that had previously been used in the 1960s as a juvenile detention center instead of starting the project from the beginning Other green characteristics of this Santa Fe hotel are skylights energyefficient lighting and watersaving fixtures Also the Inn of the Anasazi stimulates the regional economy by purchasing locally grown organic food from Hispanic farmers Lastly the Inn encourage that the staff participate in local nonprofit organizations and events that sponsor diverse local cultures The Inn of the Anasazi integrates social and environmental goals with financial considerations… Taipei 101 Taipei 101 is a 1667foot tall skyscraper located in Taiwan and has received LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification from the US Green Building Council as the highest score in history Taipei is an acronym for technology art innovation people environment and identity Dr Hubert Keiber CEO of Siemens Building Automation in Taipei stresses energy efficiency on the grounds that energy is the single largest expense for commercial buildings Since 2011 the Taipei 101 has become the worlds most environmentally responsible skyscraper reducing water use energy use and carbon emissions all by 10 Boulder Colorado Growth managementlimitation discussed previously manifests itself in Boulder Colorado The city of Boulder very tightly restricts housing development by limiting housing permits to 400 per year which is 1 percent of the citys total housing stock Additionally the city has purchased land outside of the city limits designated for permanent green open space This 400unit cap seriously hinders population growth in the city This shortage of housing has several repercussions First of all it increases housing prices Also because Boulder restricts housing development more than it does commercial development the number of available workers in Boulder grows faster than the housing stock This results in many workers who commute from beyond the city limits Controversy A common critique of green development is that it negatively affects the way real estate developers do business as it can increase cost and create delay For example becoming LEED certified Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design can contribute to additional costs This includes additional building design and construction fees interior design and construction fees building operations and maintenance fees neighborhood development fees home and campus fees and volume program fees Additionally green development has been critiqued on a residential level Highperformance homes have proven to save energy in the long run but they rapidly increase upfront capital costs via tankless water heaters radiant barriers and reflective insulation systems and high efficiency air conditioning systems Also developers are often unable to develop on certain portions of land due to conservation easements These easements are purchased by governments or nongovernmental organizations in order to preserve land in its natural scenic agricultural historical forested or openspace condition However some developers argue that conservation easements leave landowners with limited uses See also Sustainable development portal Green building Greencollar worker
