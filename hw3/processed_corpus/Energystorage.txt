 Further information Wind power grid integration and List of energy storage projects Energy storage is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation chemical gravitational potential electrical potential electricity elevated temperature latent heat and kinetic Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms Bulk energy storage is dominated by pumped hydro which accounts for 99 of global energy storage Some technologies provide shortterm energy storage while others can endure for much longer A windup clock stores potential energy in this case mechanical in the spring tension a rechargeable battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels Food which is made by the same process as fossil fuels is a form of energy stored in chemical form Ice storage tanks store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling The energy isnt stored directly but the workproduct of consuming energy pumping away heat is stored having the equivalent effect on daytime consumption History Prehistory The energy present at the initial formation of the universe is stored in stars such as the Sun and is used by humans directly eg through solar heating or sun tanning or indirectly eg by growing crops consuming photosynthesized plants or conversion into electricity in solar cells As a purposeful activity energy storage has existed since prehistory though it was often not explicitly recognized as such An example of mechanical energy storage is the use of logs or boulders as defensive measures in ancient forts—the logs or boulders were collected at the top of a hill or wall and the energy thus stored was used to attack invaders who came within range Certainly storing dried wood or another source for fire or preserving edible food or seeds in dry or cool areas such as in a cave under rocks or underground serves as other examples of energy storage Recent History In the twentieth century grid electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel When less power was required less fuel was burned Concerns with air pollution energy imports and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours while demand often peaks after sunset see duck curve Interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the renewable energy industry begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption Off grid electrical use was a niche market in the twentieth century but in the twenty first century it has expanded Portable devices are in use all over the world Solar panels are now a common sight in the rural settings worldwide Access to electricity is now a question of economics not location Powering transportation without burning fuel however remains in development Methods Outline See also Outline of energy storage The following list includes natural and other noncommercial types of energy storage in addition to those designed for use in industry and commerce Mechanical Compressed air energy storage CAES Fireless locomotive Flywheel energy storage Gravitational potential energy device

thermal energy storage Solar pond Steam accumulator Thermal energy storage general Chemical Biofuels Hydrated salts Hydrogen Hydrogen peroxide Power to gas Vanadium pentoxide Mechanical storage Energy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using pumped storage methods and also by moving solid matter to higher locations Other commercial mechanical methods include compressing air and flywheels that convert electric energy into kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks Hydroelectricity Main article Hydroelectricity Hydroelectric dams with reservoirs can be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high The net effect is similar to pumped storage but without the pumping loss While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources In this mode dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage because only the timing of its generation changes Hydroelectric turbines have a startup time on the order of a few minutes Pumpedstorage Main article Pumpedstorage hydroelectricity Worldwide pumpedstorage hydroelectricity PSH is the largestcapacity form of active grid energy storage available and as of March 2012 the Electric Power Research Institute EPRI reports that PSH accounts for more than 99 of bulk storage capacity worldwide representing around 127000 MW PSH reported energy efficiency varies in practice between 70 and 80 with claims of up to 87 At times of low electrical demand excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir When demand grows water is released back into a lower reservoir or waterway or body of water through a turbine generating electricity Reversible turbinegenerator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine usually a Francis turbine design Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies Pure pumpedstorage plants shift the water between reservoirs while the pumpback approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants that use natural streamflow Compressed air Main article Compressed air energy storage Compressed air energy storage CAES uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives The compressed air is stored in an underground reservoir Compression of air creates heat the air is warmer after compression Expansion requires heat If no extra heat is added the air will be much colder after expansion If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion efficiency improves considerably A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways Air storage can be adiabatic diabatic or isothermal Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles Flywheel energy storage Main articles Flywheel energy storage and Flywheel storage power system Flywheel energy storage FES works by accelerating a rotor flywheel to a very high speed holding energy as rotational energy When energy is extracted the flywheels rotational speed declines as a consequence of conservation of energy adding energy correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration FES systems have rotors made of high strength carbonfiber composites suspended by magnetic bearings and spinning at speeds from 20000 to over 50000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure Such flywheels can reach maximum speed charge in a matter of minutes The flywheel system is connected to a combination electric motorgenerator FES systems have relatively long lifetimes lasting decades with little or no maintenance fullcycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 10 up to 10 cycles of use high energy density 100–130 W·hkg or 360–500 kJkg and power density Gravitational potential energy storage with solid masses Changing the altitude of solid masses can store or release energy via an elevating system driven by an electric motorgenerator Companies such as Energy Cache and Advanced Rail Energy Storage ARES are working on this ARES uses rails to move concrete weights up and down Stratosolar proposes to use winches supported by buoyant platforms at an altitude of 20 kilometers to raise and lower solid masses Sink Float Solutions proposes to use winches supported by an ocean barge for taking advantage of a 4 km 13000 ft elevation difference between the surface and the seabed ARES estimated a capital cost for the storage capacity of around 60 of pump storage hydroelectricity Stratosolar 100kWh and Sink Float Solutions 25kWh 4000 m depth and 50kWh with 2000 m depth Potential energy storage or gravity energy storage was under active development in 2013 in association with the California Independent System Operator It examined the movement of earthfilled hopper rail cars driven by electric locomotives from lower to higher elevations ARES claimed advantages including indefinite storage with no energy losses low costs when earthrocks are used and conservation of water resources Thermal storage Main articles Thermal energy storage and Seasonal thermal energy storage Thermal storage is the temporary storage or removal of heat TES is practical because of waters large heat of fusion the melting of one metric ton of ice approximately one cubic metre in size can capture 334 megajoules MJ 317000 BTU of thermal energy An example is Alberta Canadas Drake Landing Solar Community for which 97 of the yearround heat is provided by solarthermal collectors on the garage roofs with a borehole thermal energy store BTES being the enabling technology STES projects often have paybacks in the fourtosix year range In Braestrup Denmark the communitys solar district heating system also utilizes STES at a storage temperature of 65 °C 149 °F A heat pump which is run only when there is surplus wind power available on the national grid is used to raise the temperature to 80 °C 176 °F for distribution When surplus wind generated electricity is not available a gasfired boiler is used Twenty percent of Braestrups heat is solar Latent heat thermal energy storage LHTES Latent heat thermal energy storage systems works with materials with high latent heat heat of fusion capacity known as phase change materials PCMs The main advantage of these materials is that their latent heat storage capacity is much more than sensible heat In a specific temperature range phase changes from solid to liquid absorbs a large amount of thermal energy for later use Electrochemical Rechargeable battery Main articles Rechargeable battery and Battery storage power station A rechargeable battery comprises one or more electrochemical cells It is known as a secondary cell because its electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible Rechargeable batteries come in many different shapes and sizes ranging from button cells to megawatt grid systems Rechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than nonrechargeable disposable batteries Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same form factors as disposables Rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times Common rechargeable battery chemistries include Lead–acid battery Lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products A single cell produces about 2V when charged In the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the lead sulfate positive electrode are immersed in a dilute sulfuric acid H2SO4 electrolyte In the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water Nickel–cadmium battery NiCd Uses nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes Cadmium is a toxic element and was banned for most uses by the European Union in 2004 Nickel–cadmium batteries have been almost completely replaced by nickel–metal hydride NiMH batteries Nickel–metal hydride battery NiMH First commercial types were available in 1989 These are now a common consumer and industrial type The battery has a hydrogenabsorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium Lithiumion battery The choice in many consumer electronics and have one of the best energytomass ratios and a very slow selfdischarge when not in use Lithiumion polymer battery These batteries are light in weight and can be made in any shape desired Flow battery Main articles Flow battery and Vanadium redox battery A flow battery operates by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to chargedischarge the cell Cell voltage is chemically determined by the Nernst equation and ranges in practical applications from 10 to 22 V Its storage capacity is a function of the volume of the tanks holding the solution A flow battery is technically akin both to a fuel cell and an electrochemical accumulator cell Commercial applications are for long halfcycle storage such as backup grid power Supercapacitor Main article Supercapacitor Supercapacitors also called electric doublelayer capacitors EDLC or ultracapacitors are generic terms for a family of electrochemical capacitors that do not have conventional solid dielectrics Capacitance is determined by two storage principles doublelayer capacitance and pseudocapacitance Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries They store the most energy per unit volume or mass energy density among capacitors They support up to 10000 farads12 volt up to 10000 times that of electrolytic capacitors but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time power density While supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10 of batteries their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater This results in much shorter chargedischarge cycles Additionally they will tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than batteries Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications including Low supply current for memory backup in static randomaccess memory SRAM Power for cars buses trains cranes and elevators including energy recovery from braking shortterm energy storage and burstmode power delivery UltraBattery Main article UltraBattery The UltraBattery is a hybrid leadacid cell and carbonbased ultracapacitor or supercapacitor invented by Australia’s national research body the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO The leadacid cell and ultracapacitor share the sulfuric acid electrolyte and both are packaged into the same physical unit The UltraBattery can be manufactured with similar physical and electrical characteristics to conventional leadacid batteries making it possible to costeffectively replace many leadacid applications The UltraBattery tolerates high charge and discharge levels and endures large numbers of cycles outperforming previous leadacid cells by more than an order of magnitude In hybridelectric vehicle tests millions of cycles have been achieved The UltraBattery is also highly tolerant to the effects of sulfation compared with traditional leadacid cells This means it can operate continuously in partial state of charge whereas traditional leadacid batteries are generally held at full charge between discharge events It is generally electrically inefficient to fully charge a leadacid battery so by decreasing time spent in the top region of charge the UltraBattery achieves high efficiencies typically between 85 and 95 DCDC The UltraBattery can work across a wide range of applications The constant cycling and fast charging and discharging necessary for applications such as grid regulation and leveling and electric vehicles can damage chemical batteries but are well handled by the ultracapacitive qualities of UltraBattery technology The technology has been installed in Australia and the US on the megawatt scale performing frequency regulation and renewable smoothing applications Other chemical Power to gas Main article Power to gas Power to gas is a technology which converts electricity into a gaseous fuel such as hydrogen or methane The three commercial methods use electricity to reduce water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis In the first method hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry The second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8 The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid The third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer to upgrade the quality of the biogas Hydrogen Main article Hydrogen storage The element hydrogen can be a form of stored energy Hydrogen can produce electricity via a hydrogen fuel cell At penetrations below 20 of the grid demand renewables do not severely change the economics but beyond about 20 of the total demand external storage becomes important If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen they can be freely expanded A 5year communitybased pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators began in 2007 in the remote community of Ramea Newfoundland and Labrador A similar project began in 2004 on Utsira a small Norwegian island Energy losses involved in the hydrogen storage cycle come from the electrolysis of water liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity About 50 kW·h 180 MJ of solar energy is required to produce a kilogram of hydrogen so the cost of the electricity is crucial At 003kWh a common offpeak highvoltage line rate in the United States hydrogen costs 150 a kilogram for the electricity equivalent to 150gallon for gasoline Other costs include the electrolyzer plant hydrogen compressors or liquefaction storage and transportation Underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground caverns salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by Imperial Chemical Industries for many years without any difficulties The European Hyunder project indicated in 2013 that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require 85 caverns Methane Main article Substitute natural gas Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula CH4 Methane is more easily stored and transported than hydrogen Storage and combustion infrastructure pipelines gasometers power plants are mature Synthetic natural gas syngas or SNG can be created in a multistep process starting with hydrogen and oxygen Hydrogen is then reacted with carbon dioxide in a Sabatier process producing methane and water Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity The resulting water is recycled reducing the need for water In the electrolysis stage oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant eliminating nitrogen oxides Methane combustion produces carbon dioxide CO2 and water The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis Methane production storage and combustion recycles the reaction products The CO2 has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector not a cost as in carbon capture and storage Power to liquid Power to liquid is similar to power to gas however the hydrogen produced by electrolysis from wind and solar electricity isnt converted into gases such as methane but into liquids such as methanol Methanol is easier in handling than gases and requires less safety precautions than hydrogen It can be used for transportation including aircraft but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector Biofuels Main article Biofuel Various biofuels such as biodiesel vegetable oil alcohol fuels or biomass can replace fossil fuels Various chemical processes can convert the carbon and hydrogen in coal natural gas plant and animal biomass and organic wastes into short hydrocarbons suitable as replacements for existing hydrocarbon fuels Examples are Fischer–Tropsch diesel methanol dimethyl ether and syngas This diesel source was used extensively in World War II in Germany which faced limited access to crude oil supplies South Africa produces most of the countrys diesel from coal for similar reasons A long term oil price above US35bbl may make such large scale synthetic liquid fuels economical Aluminium boron silicon and zinc Aluminium Boron silicon lithium and zinc have been proposed as energy storage solutions Electrical methods Capacitor Main article capacitor A capacitor originally known as a condenser is a passive twoterminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically Practical capacitors vary widely but all contain at least two electrical conductors plates separated by a dielectric ie insulator A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit so it can be used like a temporary battery or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change This prevents loss of information in volatile memory Conventional capacitors provide less than 360 joules per kilogram while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of 590 kJkg Capacitors store energy in an electrostatic field between their plates Given a potential difference across the conductors eg when a capacitor is attached across a battery an electric field develops across the dielectric causing positive charge Q to collect on one plate and negative charge Q to collect on the other plate If a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time no current can flow through the capacitor However if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor a displacement current can flow Capacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area In practice the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of leakage current and has an electric field strength limit known as the breakdown voltage The conductors and leads introduce undesired inductance and resistance Research is assessing the quantum effects of nanoscale capacitors for digital quantum batteries Superconducting magnetics Main article Superconducting magnetic energy storage Superconducting magnetic energy storage SMES systems store energy in a magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature A typical SMES system includes a superconducting coil power conditioning system and refrigerator Once the superconducting coil is charged the current does not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely The stored energy can be released to the network by discharging the coil The associated inverterrectifier accounts for about 2–3 energy loss in each direction SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy SMES systems offer roundtrip efficiency greater than 95 Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the cost of superconducting wire SMES is used for short duration storage such as improving power quality It also has applications in grid balancing Interseasonal thermal storage Seasonal thermal energy storage STES allows heat or cold to be used months after it was collected from waste energy or natural sources The material can be stored in contained aquifers clusters of boreholes in geological substrates such as sand or crystalline bedrock in lined pits filled with gravel and water or waterfilled mines Applications Mills A more recent application is the control of waterways to drive water mills for processing grain or powering machinery Complex systems of reservoirs and dams were constructed to store and release water and the potential energy it contained when required Home energy storage Main article Home Energy Storage Home energy storage is expected to become increasingly present given the growing importance of distributed generation especially photovoltaics and the important share of energy consumption in buildings A household equipped with photovoltaics can achieve a maximum electricity selfsufficiency of about 40 To reach higher levels of selfsufficiency energy storage is needed given the mismatch between energy consumption and energy production from photovoltaics In 2015 multiple manufacturers announced rechargeable battery systems for storing energy generally to hold surplus energy from home solarwind generation Tesla Motors announced the first two models of the Tesla Powerwall One is a 10 kWh weekly cycle version for backup applications and the other is a 7 kWh version for daily cycle applications Enphase Energy announced an integrated system that allows home users to store monitor and manage electricity The system stores 12 kWh hours of energy and 275W500W power output Grid electricity Main article Grid energy storage Renewable energy storage The largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons A very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind If wind or solar generation exceeds the regions hydroelectric capacity then some additional source of energy will be needed Many renewable energy sources notably solar and wind produce variable power Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms The main method of electrical grid storage is pumpedstorage hydroelectricity Areas of the world such as Norway Wales Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for reservoirs using electrically powered pumps to fill them When needed the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity Pumped storage in Norway which gets almost all its electricity from hydro has an instantaneous capacity of 25–30 GW expandable to 60 GW—enough to be Europes battery Some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumpedstorage hydroelectric dams rechargeable batteries thermal storage including molten salts which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy and compressed air energy storage flywheels cryogenic systems and superconducting magnetic coils Surplus power can also be converted into methane sabatier process with stockage in the natural gas network In 2011 the Bonneville Power Administration in Northwestern United States created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds Under central control home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in special space heaters to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified hot water heater tanks After charging the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed The experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down or in the case of a nuclear power plant reduced to its lowest possible operating level leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy Another advanced method used at the former Solar Two project in the United States and the Solar Tres Power Tower in Spain uses molten salt to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power The system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun Insulated tanks store the solution Electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to turbines Since the early 21st century batteries have been applied to utility scale loadleveling and frequency regulation capabilities In vehicletogrid storage electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed Generation Chemical fuels remain the dominant form of energy storage for electricity generation Natural gas is crowding out other forms such as oil and coal Air conditioning Main article Ice storage air conditioning Thermal energy storage TES can be used for air conditioning It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings andor groups of smaller buildings Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads In 2009 thermal storage was used in over 3300 buildings in over 35 countries It works by creating ice at night and using the ice to for cooling during the hotter daytime periods The most popular technique is ice storage which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels In this application a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile Water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chillers daytime output A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day At night they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water Such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 50 of the size needed for a conventional nostorage design Storage sufficient to store half a days available heat is usually adequate A full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours Capital costs are higher as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system This ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower Offpeak cooling systems can lower energy costs The US Green Building Council has developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED program to encourage the design of reducedenvironmental impact buildings Offpeak cooling may help toward LEED Certification Thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night Latent heat can also be stored in technical phase change materials PCMs These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels to moderate room temperatures Transport Liquid hydrocarbon fuels are the most commonly used forms of energy storage for use in transportation Other energy carriers such as hydrogen can be used to avoid producing greenhouse gases Electronics Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass In analog filter networks they smooth the output of power supplies In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies In electric power transmission systems they stabilize voltage and power flow Use cases Main article United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database The United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database IESDB is a freeaccess database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the United States Department of Energy Office of Electricity and Sandia National Labs Storage capacity Storage capacity is the amount of energy extracted from a power plant energy storage system usually measured in joules or kilowatthours and their multiples it may be given in number of hours of electricity production at power plant nameplate capacity when storage is of primary type ie thermal or pumpedwater output is sourced only with the power plant embedded storage system Economics The economics of Energy Storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of Energy Storage Therefore not every Energy Storage is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several MWh and the optimal size of the Energy Storage is market and location dependent Moreover ESS are affected by several risks eg 1 technoeconomic risks which are related to the specific technology 2 Market risks which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system 3 Regulation and policy risks Therefore traditional techniques based on deterministic Discounted Cash Flow DCF for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investor’s flexibility to deal with them Hence the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the Real Option Analysis ROA which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts The economic valuation of largescale applications including pumped hydro storage and compressed air considers benefits including wind curtailment avoidance grid congestion avoidance price arbitrage and carbon free energy delivery In one technical assessment by the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre economic goals could be met with batteries if energy storage were achievable at a capital cost of 30 to 50 per kilowatthour of storage capacity A metric for calculating the energy efficiency of storage systems is Energy Storage On Energy Invested ESOI which is the useful energy used to make the storage system divided into the lifetime energy storage For lithium ion batteries this is around 10 and for lead acid batteries it is about 2 Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI such as 210 Research Germany The German Federal government has allocated €200M approximately US270M for advanced research as well as providing a further €50M to subsidize battery storage for use with residential rooftop solar panels according to a representative of the German Energy Storage Association Siemens AG commissioned a productionresearch plant to open in 2015 at the Zentrum für Sonnenenergie und Wasserstoff ZSW the German Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research in the State of BadenWürttemberg a universityindustry collaboration in Stuttgart Ulm and Widderstall staffed by approximately 350 scientists researchers engineers and technicians The plant develops new nearproduction manufacturing materials and processes NPMMP using a computerized Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA system Its goals will enable the expansion of rechargeable battery production with both increased quality and reduced manufacturing costs United States In 2014 research and test centers opened to evaluate energy storage technologies Among them was the Advanced Systems Test Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in Wisconsin State which partnered with battery manufacturer Johnson Controls The laboratory was created as part of the universitys newly opened Wisconsin Energy Institute Their goals include the evaluation of stateoftheart and next generation electric vehicle batteries including their use as grid supplements The State of New York unveiled its New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology NYBEST Test and Commercialization Center at Eastman Business Park in Rochester New York at a cost of 23 million for its almost 1700 m laboratory The center includes the Center for Future Energy Systems a collaboration between Cornell University of Ithaca New York and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy New York NYBEST tests validates and independently certifies diverse forms of energy storage intended for commercial use United Kingdom In the United Kingdom some fourteen industry and government agencies allied with seven British universities in May 2014 to create the SUPERGEN Energy Storage Hub in order to assist in the coordination of energy storage technology
