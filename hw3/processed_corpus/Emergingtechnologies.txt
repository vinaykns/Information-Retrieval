 For specific emerging technologies see the List of emerging technologies Emerging technologies are technologies that are perceived as capable of changing the status quo These technologies are generally new but include older technologies that are still controversial and relatively undeveloped in potential such as 3D printing preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene therapy which date to 1981 1989 and 1990 respectively Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty relatively fast growth coherence prominent impact and uncertainty and ambiguity In other words an emerging technology can be defined as a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socioeconomic domains which is observed in terms of the composition of actors institutions and patterns of interactions among those along with the associated knowledge production processes Its most prominent impact however lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as educational technology information technology nanotechnology biotechnology cognitive science psychotechnology robotics and artificial intelligence New technological fields may result from the technological convergence of different systems evolving towards similar goals Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice and telephony features data and productivity applications and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other creating new efficiencies Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for competitive advantage converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger interconnection and similar goals However the opinion on the degree of the impact status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies vary History of emerging technologies Main article History of technology In the history of technology emerging technologies are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of technology Over centuries innovative methods and new technologies are developed and opened up Some of these technologies are due to theoretical research and others from commercial research and development Technological growth includes incremental developments and disruptive technologies An example of the former was the gradual rollout of DVD digital video disc as a development intended to follow on from the previous optical technology compact disc By contrast disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous technology and makes it redundant for example the replacement of horsedrawn carriages by automobiles Emerging technology debates See also Technology and society Many writers including computer scientist Bill Joy have identified clusters of technologies that they consider critical to humanitys future Joy warns that the technology could be used by elites for good or evil They could use it as good shepherds for the rest of humanity or decide everyone else is superfluous and push for mass extinction of those made unnecessary by technology Advocates of the benefits of technological change typically see emerging and converging technologies as offering hope for the betterment of the human condition Cyberphilosophers Alexander Bard and Jan SÃ¶derqvist argue in The Futurica Trilogy that while Man himself is basically constant throughout human history genes change very slowly all relevant change is rather a direct or indirect result of technological innovation memes change very fast since new ideas always emanate from technology use and not the other way around Man should consequently be regarded as historys main constant and technology as its main variable However critics of the risks of technological change and even some advocates such as transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom warn that some of these technologies could pose dangers perhaps even contribute to the extinction of humanity itself ie some of them could involve existential risks Much ethical debate centers on issues of distributive justice in allocating access to beneficial forms of technology Some thinkers such as environmental ethicist Bill McKibben oppose the continuing development of advanced technology partly out of fear that its benefits will be distributed unequally in ways that could worsen the plight of the poor By contrast inventor Ray Kurzweil is among technoutopians who believe that emerging and converging technologies could and will eliminate poverty and abolish suffering Some analysts such as Martin Ford author of The Lights in the Tunnel Automation Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future argue that as information technology advances robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines and software begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine jobs As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further even many skilled jobs may be threatened Technologies such as machine learning may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledgebased jobs that require significant education This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels stagnant or falling wages for most workers and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever larger fraction of the economy This in turn could lead to depressed consumer spending and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy See also Technological innovation system Technological utopianism and Technoprogressivism See also Current research in evolutionary biology Bioconservatism Bioethics and Biopolitics Examples Main article List of emerging technologies Artificial intelligence Main articles Artificial intelligence and Outline of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence AI is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software and the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with humanlike intelligence Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success John McCarthy who coined the term in 1955 defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines The central problems or goals of AI research include reasoning knowledge planning learning natural language processing communication perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects General intelligence or strong AI is still among the fields longterm goals Currently popular approaches include deep learning statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI There are an enormous number of tools used in AI including versions of search and mathematical optimization logic methods based on probability and economics and many others 3D Printing Main article 3D Printing 3D printing also known as additive manufacturing has been posited by Jeremy Rifkin and others as part of the third industrial revolution Combined with Internet technology 3D printing would allow for digital blueprints of virtually any material product to be sent instantly to another person to be produced on the spot making purchasing a product online almost instantaneous Although this technology is still too crude to produce most products it was controversially done with guns in 2013 and the technology is rapidly developing Gene therapy Main article Gene therapy See also Genetic engineering timeline Gene therapy was first successfully demonstrated in late 1990early 1991 for adenosine deaminase deficiency though the treatment was somatic that is did not affect the patients germ line and thus was not heritable This led the way to treatments for other genetic diseases and increased interest in germ line gene therapy therapy affecting the gametes and descendants of patients Between September 1990 and January 2014 there were around 2000 gene therapy trials conducted or approved Cancer vaccines Main article Cancer vaccine A cancer vaccine is a vaccine that treats existing cancer or prevents the development of cancer in certain highrisk individuals Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as therapeutic cancer vaccines There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general On April 14 2009 Dendreon Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of Provenge a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer had demonstrated an increase in survival It received US Food and Drug Administration FDA approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29 2010 The approval of Provenge has stimulated interest in this type of therapy In vitro meat Main article In vitro meat In vitro meat also called cultured meat crueltyfree meat shmeat and testtube meat is an animalflesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the fetal calf serum taken from a slaughtered cow In the 21st century several research projects have worked on in vitro meat in the laboratory The first in vitro beefburger created by a Dutch team was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013 There remain difficulties to be overcome before in vitro meat becomes commercially available Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves In vitro meat is also an ethical issue Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesnt involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally Nanotechnology Main articles Nanotechnology and Outline of nanotechnology Nanotechnology sometimes shortened to nanotech is the manipulation of matter on an atomic molecular and supramolecular scale The earliest widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantumrealm scale and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold Robotics Main articles Robotics and Outline of robotics Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design construction operation and application of robots as well as computer systems for their control sensory feedback and information processing These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes or resemble humans in appearance behavior andor cognition Many of todays robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bioinspired robotics Stem cell therapy Main article Stem cell therapy Stem cell therapy is an intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue in order to treat disease or injury Many medical researchers believe that stem cell treatments have the potential to change the face of human disease and alleviate suffering The ability of stem cells to selfrenew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities offers significant potential for generation of tissues that can potentially replace diseased and damaged areas in the body with minimal risk of rejection and side effects Development of emerging technologies As innovation drives economic growth and large economic rewards come from new inventions a great deal of resources funding and effort go into the development of emerging technologies Some of the sources of these resources are described below Research and development Research and development is directed towards the advancement of technology in general and therefore includes development of emerging technologies See also List of countries by research and development spending Applied research is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science It accesses and uses some part of the research communities the academias accumulated theories knowledge methods and techniques for a specific often state business or clientdriven purpose Science policy is the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science and research enterprise including the funding of science often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development weapons development health care and environmental monitoring DARPA The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA is an agency of the US Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military DARPA was created in 1958 as the Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA by President Dwight D Eisenhower Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements Projects funded by DARPA have provided significant technologies that influenced many nonmilitary fields such as computer networking and graphical user interfaces in information technology Technology competitions and awards There are awards that provide incentive to push the limits of technology generally synonymous with emerging technologies Note that while some of these awards reward achievement afterthefact via analysis of the merits of technological breakthroughs others provide incentive via competitions for awards offered for goals yet to be achieved The Orteig Prize was a 25000 award offered in 1919 by French hotelier Raymond Orteig for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris In 1927 underdog Charles Lindbergh won the prize in a modified singleengine Ryan aircraft called the Spirit of St Louis In total nine teams spent 400000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize The XPRIZE series of awards public competitions designed and managed by the nonprofit organization called the X Prize Foundation are intended to encourage technological development that could benefit mankind The most highprofile XPRIZE to date was the 10000000 Ansari XPRIZE relating to spacecraft development which was awarded in 2004 for the development of SpaceShipOne The Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery ACM to an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community It is stipulated that The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and in 2014 grew to 1000000 The Millennium Technology Prize is awarded once every two years by Technology Academy Finland an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the Finnish state in partnership The first recipient was Tim BernersLee inventor of the World Wide Web In 2003 David Gobel seedfunded the Methuselah Mouse Prize Mprize to encourage the development of new life extension therapies in mice which are genetically similar to humans So far three Mouse Prizes have been awarded one for breaking longevity records to Dr Andrzej Bartke of Southern Illinois University one for lateonset rejuvenation strategies to Dr Stephen Spindler of the University of California and one to Dr Z Dave Sharp for his work with the pharmaceutical rapamycin Role of science fiction Science fiction has criticized developing and future technologies but also inspires innovation and new technology This topic has been more often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums Cinema and media theorist Vivian Sobchack examines the dialogue between science fiction films and technological imagination Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination How William Shatner Changed the World is a documentary that gave a number of realworld examples of actualized technological imaginations While more prevalent in the early years of science fiction with writers like Arthur C Clarke new authors still find ways to make currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized See also Technology portal List of emerging technologies
