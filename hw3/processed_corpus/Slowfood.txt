 Slow Food is a grassroots organization founded by Carlo Petrini in Italy in 1986 It has since spread worldwide Promoted as an alternative to fast food it strives to preserve traditional and regional cuisine and encourages farming of plants seeds and livestock characteristic of the local ecosystem It was the first established part of the broader slow movement Its goals of sustainable foods and promotion of local small businesses are paralleled by a political agenda directed against globalization of agricultural products Organization Slow Food began in Italy with the founding of its forerunner organisation Arcigola in 1986 to resist the opening of a McDonalds near the Spanish Steps in Rome In 1989 the founding manifesto of the international Slow Food movement was signed in Paris France by delegates from 15 countries At its heart is the aim to promote local foods and traditional gastronomy and food production Conversely this means an opposition to fast food industrial food

President Carlo Petrini believes everyone has the right to good clean and fair food Good meaning a high quality product with a flavorful taste clean meaning the naturalness in the way the product was

date dubbed Slow Food Nation in San Francisco As of 2013 Slow Food USA has a membership of roughly 12000 down from over 30000 in 2008 In 2011 the organisation was forced to make a series of staff layoffs and reductions and had faced a significant reduction in their income from wealthy supporters This was partly attributed to the economic recession but also to disagreements within the movement and a loss of several key personalities Slow Food USA currently has 200 chapters down from 225 chapters in 2011 These are locally based organisations that hold events and education outreach programs that benefit their communities while carrying out the message of the slow food and advancing the local environmental movement The movement also encourages the creation of urban gardens Beyond the chapters established within the cities in the United States there are a number of Universities that are becoming recognised by Slow Food USA including the University of Wisconsin at Madison Slow

Queenslandnative bunya nut bullboar sausage from Victoria and Tasmanian Leatherwood honey Wine In 2010 Slow Food International began its independent Slow Wine project with the release of a wine guide Prior to 2010 Slow Food worked with publisher Gambero Rosso to release a guide The first edition of Slow Foods first solo effort was released in 1993 with the title Slow Food guide to the wines of the world translated into 5 languages and sold in more than fifty thousand copies The guide was an attempt to review not only the wines but the wineries and the people behind the bottle There have been two editions of the guide also available in English Criticisms Slow Foods aims have been compared to the Arts and Crafts movements response to 19thcentury industrialisation Some of the criticisms aimed at the movement are socioeconomic For example without significantly altering the working day of the masses slow food preparation can be an additional burden to whoever prepares food In contrast the more affluent society can afford the time and expense of developing taste knowledge and discernment Slow Foods stated aim of preserving itself from the contagion of the multitude can be seen as elitist In 1989 Petrini visited Venezuela and began to recognize the socioeconomic barriers that many faced with regard to the slow food movement To address this he adjusted the slow food agenda to include an alternative food approach that favored healthy local communitybased food consumption and production While this made the slow food movement more accessible for many it did not eliminate all of the socioeconomic barriers faced within the movement See also Food portal Agroecology Ark of Taste Artisanal food Cittaslow Declaration for Healthy Food and Agriculture Good Food March Local food
