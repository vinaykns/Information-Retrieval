of 2015 The city serves as the county seat of Richland County and a portion of the city extends into neighboring Lexington County It is the center of the Columbia metropolitan statistical area which had a population of 767598 as of the 2010 United States Census growing to 810068 by July 1 2015 according to 2015 US Census estimates The name Columbia was a poetic term used for the United States originating from the name of Christopher Columbus The city is located approximately 13 miles 21 km northwest of the geographic center of South Carolina and is the primary city of the Midlands region of the state It lies at the confluence of the Saluda River and the Broad River which merge at Columbia to form the Congaree River Columbia is home to the University of South Carolina the states flagship and largest university and is also the site of Fort Jackson the largest United States Army installation for Basic Combat Training In 1860 the city was the location of the South Carolina Secession Convention which marked the departure of the first state from the Union in the events leading up to the Civil War History See also Timeline of Columbia South Carolina Early history At the time of European encounter the inhabitants of the area that became Columbia were a people called the Congaree In May 1540 a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto traversed what is now Columbia while moving northward The expedition produced the earliest written historical records of the area which was part of the regional Cofitachequi chiefdom From the creation of Columbia by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1786 the site of Columbia was important to the overall development of the state The Congarees a frontier fort on the west bank of the Congaree River was the head of navigation in the Santee River system A ferry was established by the colonial government in 1754 to connect the fort with the growing settlements on the higher ground on the east bank Like many other significant early settlements in colonial America Columbia is on the fall line from the Piedmont region The fall line is the spot where a river becomes unnavigable when sailing upstream and where falling water downstream cannot power a mill State Senator John Lewis Gervais of the town of Ninety Six introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22 1786 to create a new state capital There was considerable argument over the name for the new city According to published accounts Senator Gervais said he hoped that in this town we should find refuge under the wings of COLUMBIA for that was the name which he wished it to be called One legislator insisted on the name Washington but Columbia won by a vote of 11–7 in the state senate The site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786 due to its central location in the state The State Legislature first met there in 1790 After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854 Columbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to Charleston by the Santee Canal This canal connected the Santee and Cooper rivers in a 22milelong 35 km section It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800 making it one of the earliest canals in the United States With increased railroad traffic it ceased operation around 1850 The commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a 2mile 3 km square along the river The blocks were divided into lots of 05 acres 2000 m and sold to speculators and prospective residents Buyers had to build a house at least 30 feet 91 m long and 18 feet 55 m wide within three years or face an annual 5 penalty The perimeter streets and two through streets were 150 feet 46 m wide The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares 100 feet 30 m wide The width was determined by the belief that dangerous and pesky mosquitoes could not fly more than 60 feet 18 m without dying of starvation along the way Columbians still enjoy most of the magnificent network of wide streets The commissioners comprised the local government until 1797 when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly Three main issues occupied most of their time public drunkenness gambling and poor sanitation As one of the first planned cities in the United States Columbia began to grow rapidly Its population was nearing 1000 shortly after the start of the 19th century 19th century Main article Columbia South Carolina in the American Civil War In 1801 South Carolina College now the University of South Carolina was founded in Columbia The original building survives The city was chosen as the site of the institution in part to unite the citizens of the Upcountry and the Lowcountry and to discourage the youth from migrating to England for their higher education At the time South Carolina sent more young men to England than did any other state The leaders of South Carolina wished to monitor the progress and development of the school for many years after the founding of the university commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session Columbia received its first charter as a town in 1805 An intendant and six wardens would govern the town John Taylor the first elected intendant later served in both houses of the General Assembly both houses of Congress and eventually as governor By 1816 there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854 with an elected mayor and six aldermen Two years later Columbia had a police force consisting of a fulltime chief and nine patrolmen The city continued to grow at a rapid pace and throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales not passengers Cotton was the lifeblood of the Columbia community in 1850 virtually all of the citys commercial and economic activity was related to cotton In 1830 approximately 1500 slaves lived and worked in Columbia this population grew to 3300 by 1860 Some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters households Masters also frequently hired out slaves to Columbia residents and institutions including South Carolina College Hiredout slaves sometimes returned to their owners home daily others boarded with their temporary masters During this period legislators developed state and local statutes to restrict the movement of urban slaves in hopes of preventing rebellion Although various decrees established curfews and prohibited slaves from meeting and from learning to read and write such rulings were difficult to enforce Indeed several prewar accounts note that many Columbia slaves were literate some slaves even conducted classes to teach others to read and write As well many slaves attended services at local Baptist Presbyterian and Methodist churches yet some struggled to obtain membership in these institutions Columbias First Baptist Church hosted the South Carolina Secession Convention on December 17 1860 The delegates drafted a resolution in favor of secession 159–0 Columbias location made it an ideal location for other conventions and meetings within the Confederacy On February 17 1865 in the last months of the Civil War much of Columbia was destroyed by fire while being occupied by Union troops under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman Jeff Goodwyn mayor of Columbia sent William B Stanley and Thomas W Radcliffe to surrender the city to Shermans troops According to legend Columbias First Baptist Church barely missed being torched by Shermans troops The soldiers marched up to the church and asked the sexton if he could direct them to the First Baptist Church The sexton directed the men to the nearby Washington Street Methodist Church thus the historic landmark was saved from destruction by Union soldiers and the sexton preserved his employment at the cost of another Controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton which had been stacked in the streets General Sherman denied ordering the burning though he did order militarily significant structures such as the Confederate Printing Plant destroyed Firsthand accounts by local residents Union soldiers and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by Union troops for Columbias and South Carolinas pivotal role in leading Southern states to secede from the Union Today tourists can follow the path General Shermans army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire During Reconstruction Columbia became the focus of considerable attention Reporters journalists travelers and tourists flocked to South Carolinas capital city to witness a Southern state legislature whose members included former slaves The city also made somewhat of a rebound following the devastating fire of 1865 a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction and repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created jobs for area citizens Following Reconstruction the Columbia Music Festival Association CMFA was established in 1897 by Mayor William McB Sloan and the aldermen of the city of Columbia It was headquartered in the Opera House on Main Street which was also City Hall Its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city 20th century The first few years of the 20th century saw Columbia emerge as a regional textile manufacturing center In 1907 Columbia had six mills in operation Richland Granby Olympia Capital City Columbia and Palmetto Combined they employed over 3400 workers with an annual payroll of 819000 giving the Midlands an economic boost of over 48 million Columbia had no paved streets until 1908 when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced There were however 115 publicly maintained street crossings at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks As an experiment Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925 The years 1911 and 1912 were something of a construction boom for Columbia with 25 million worth of construction occurring in the city These projects included the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais the Palmetto National Bank a shopping arcade and large hotels at Main and Laurel the Jefferson and at Main and Wheat the Gresham In 1917 the city was selected as the site of Camp Jackson a US military installation which was officially classified as a Field Artillery Replacement Depot The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1 1917 In 1930 Columbia was the hub of a trading area with approximately 500000 potential customers It had 803 retail establishments 280 of them being food stores There were also 58 clothing and apparel outlets 57 restaurants and lunch rooms 55 filling stations 38 pharmacies 20 furniture stores 19 auto dealers 11 shoe stores nine cigar stands five department stores and one book store Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119 with onethird of them dealing in food In 1934 the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall Built of granite from nearby Winnsboro Columbia City Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places Designed by Alfred Built Millet President Ulysses S Grants federal architect the building was completed in 1876 Millet best known for his design of the Executive Office Building in Washington DC had originally designed the building with a clock tower Large cost overruns probably caused it to be left out Copies of Mullets original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of Columbias beginnings Federal offices were moved to the J Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse Reactivated Camp Jackson became Fort Jackson in 1940 giving the military installation the permanence desired by city leaders at the time The fort was annexed into the city in the fall of 1968 with approval from the Pentagon In the early 1940s shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor which began Americas involvement in World War II Lt Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his group of nowfamous pilots began training for the Doolittle Raid over Tokyo at what is now Columbia Metropolitan Airport They trained in B25 Mitchell bombers the same model as the plane that now rests at Columbias Owens Field in the CurtissWright hangar The areas population continued to grow during the 1950s having experienced a 40 percent increase from 186844 to 260828 with 97433 people residing within the city limits of Columbia The 1940s saw the beginning of efforts to reverse Jim Crow laws and racial discrimination in Columbia In 1945 a federal judge ruled that the citys black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts However in years following the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned voting rights and segregation particularly regarding public schools On August 21 1962 eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time The University of South Carolina admitted its first black students in 1963 around the same time many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions and a nondiscriminatory hiring policy was adopted by the city These and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964 AllAmerica City Award for the second time the first being in 1951 and a 1965 article in Newsweek magazine lauded Columbia as a city that had liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal apartheid Historic preservation has played a significant part in shaping Columbia into the city that it is today The historic Robert Mills House was restored in 1967 which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures such as the HamptonPreston House and homes associated with President Woodrow Wilson Maxcy Gregg Mary Boykin Chesnut and noted free black Celia Mann In the early 1970s the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its Horseshoe Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time among them the Fort Jackson Museum the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina and most notably the South Carolina State Museum which opened in 1988 Mayor Kirkman Finlay Jr was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park now known as Finlay Park in the historic Congaree Vista district as well as the compilation of the 60 million Palmetto Center package which gave Columbia an office tower parking garage and the Columbia Marriott which opened in 1983 The year 1980 saw the Columbia metropolitan population reach 410088 and in 1990 this figure had hit approximately 470000 Recent history The 1990s and early 2000s saw revitalization in the downtown area The Congaree Vista district along Gervais Street once known as a warehouse district became a thriving district of art galleries shops and restaurants The Colonial Life Arena formerly known as the Colonial Center opened in 2002 and brought several bignamed concerts and shows to Columbia EdVenture the largest

move their October 10 home game Spirit Communications Park home of the Columbia Fireflies opened in April 2016 Geography and climate One of Columbias more prominent geographical features is its fall line the boundary between the upland Piedmont region and the Atlantic Coastal Plain across which rivers drop as falls or rapids Columbia grew up at the fall line of the Congaree River which is formed by the convergence of the Broad River and the Saluda River The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation The energy of falling water also powered Columbias early mills The city has capitalized on this location which includes three rivers by christening itself The Columbia Riverbanks Region Columbia is located roughly halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Blue Ridge Mountains and sits at an elevation of around 292 ft 89 m Soils in Columbia are well drained in most cases with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil The subsoil may be yellowish red sandy clay loam
