 This article is about the idea of harmony and the absence of hostility For other uses see Peace disambiguation Peace occurs between heterogeneous social groups and is characterized by a lack of conflict and freedom from fear of violence Leaders throughout history have established periods of regional peace through peace treaties that have resulted from bilateral and multilateral peace talks Commonly understood as the absence of hostility peace often involves compromise and therefore is initiated with thoughtful listening and communication to enhance and create mutual understanding Peace can be defined in a positive direction and in a negative sense Positively peace is a state of tranquility and stillness however in a negative sense peace is the absence of war or violence Etymology The term peace originates most recently from the AngloFrench pes and the Old French pais meaning peace reconciliation silence agreement 11th century But Pes itself comes from the Latin pax meaning peace compact agreement treaty of peace tranquility absence of hostility harmony The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word shalom which according to Jewish theology comes from a Hebrew verb meaning to be complete whole Although peace is the usual translation however it is an incomplete one because shalom which is also cognate with the Arabic salaam has multiple other meanings in addition to peace including justice good health safety wellbeing prosperity equity security good fortune and friendliness At a personal level peaceful behaviors are kind considerate respectful just and tolerant of others beliefs and behaviors — tending to manifest goodwill This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individuals introspective sense or concept of herhimself as in being at peace in ones own mind as found in European references from c1200 The early English term is also used in the sense of quiet reflecting calm serene and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek tranquility — an absence of disturbance or agitation In many languages the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell for example the Hawaiian word aloha as well as the Arabic word salaam In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell especially for the dead as in the phrase rest in peace Wolfgang Dietrich in his research project which led to the book The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies 2011 maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world Later in his Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture 2012 he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families EnergeticHarmony MoralJustice ModernSecurity PostmodernTruth and Transrational a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families Religious beliefs and peace Religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life including the conflicts between among and within persons and societies Among pagan faiths worship of personified Peace was organized in

knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and deaths shadow to guide our feet into the path of peace Numerous pontifical documents on the Holy Rosary document a continuity of views of the Popes to have confidence in the Holy Rosary as a means to foster peace Subsequently to the Encyclical Mense maio1965 in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary the prayer so dear to the Virgin and so much recommended by the Supreme Pontiffs and as reaffirmed in the encyclical Christi Matri 1966 to implore peace Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic Recurrens mensis october 1969 that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the great gift of peace Islam derived

be attained once all suffering ends They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings in the extreme greed aversions fears or delusions To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace

the heavens peace in the atmosphere peace on the earth Let there be coolness in the water healing in the herbs and peace radiating from the trees Let there be harmony in the planets and in the stars and perfection in eternal knowledge May everything in the universe be at peace Let peace pervade everywhere at all times May I experience that peace within my own heart — Yajur Veda 3617 Let us not concord with our own people and concord with people who are strangers to us Celestial Twins create between us and the strangers a unity of hearts May we unite in our minds unite in our purposes and not fight against the heavenly spirit within us Let not the battlecry rise amidst many slain nor the arrows of the wargod fall with the break of day — Yajur Veda 752 A superior being does not render evil for evil This is a maxim one should observe One should never harm the wicked or the good or even animals meriting death A noble soul will exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or cruel deeds Who is without fault — Valmiki Ramayana The chariot that leads to victory is of another kind Valour and fortitude are its wheels truthfulness and tirtuous conduct are its banner strength discretion selfrestraint and benevolence are its four horses harnessed with the cords of forgiveness compassion and equanimity Whoever has this righteous chariot has no enemy to conquer anywhere — Valmiki Ramayana Inner peace Main article Inner peace Inner peace or peace of mind refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress Being at peace is considered by many to be healthy homeostasis and the opposite of being stressed or anxious Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness Peace of mind serenity and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress In some cultures inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training such as prayer meditation tai chi chuan 太极拳 tàijíquán or yoga for example Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself Finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism as well as the New Age movement Satyagraha Main article Satyagraha Satyagraha Sanskrit सत्याग्रह satyāgraha is a philosophy and practice of nonviolent resistance developed by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for Indian independence and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa The word satyagraha itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa Indian Opinion when he realized that neither the common contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict According to Gandhis autobiography the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi presumably no relation who submitted the entry sadagraha which Gandhi then modified to satyagraha Etymologically this Hindic word means truthfirmness and is commonly translated as steadfastness in the truth or truthforce Satyagraha theory also influenced Martin Luther King Jr during the campaigns he led during the civil rights movement in the United States The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable Therefore it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace As Gandhi wrote They say means are after all means I would say means are after all everything As the means so the end A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi but also to A J Muste sums it up There is no way to peace peace is the way Justice and injustice Since classical times it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures In his book Agricola the Roman historian Tacitus includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome One that Tacitus says is by the Caledonian chieftain Calgacus ends Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium atque ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant To ravage to slaughter to usurp under false titles they call empire and where they make a desert they call it peace — Oxford Revised Translation Discussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace Is it simple absence of mass organized killing war or does peace require a particular morality and justice just peace A peace must be seen at least in two forms A simple silence of arms absence of war Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations which are characterized by terms such as justice mutual respect respect for law and good will More recently advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of nonpunitive nonviolent Restorative Justice methods and many of those studying the success of these methods including a United Nations working group on Restorative Justice have attempted to redefine justice in terms related to peace From the late 2000s on a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory Long periods of peace See also List of periods of regional peace The longest continuing period of peace among currently existing states is observed in Sweden which has had peace since 1814 for 203 years if Swedish participation in the wars in Afghanistan and Libya is not considered after its loss of major parts of the country to Russia in the Napoleonic wars Swedish peace may partly be explained by its geographical position partly by nonparticipation in military alliances during peacetime resulting in a certain level of Swedish neutrality during wartime and partly by the periods of relative peace in Europe and the world known as Pax Britannica 18151914 and Pax EuropaeaPax Americana since 1950s Other examples of long periods of peace are the isolationistic Edo period also known as Tokugawa shogunate in Japan 1603 to 1868 250 years Pax Khazarica in Khazar Khanate southeast Turkey about 700950 AD 250 years Pax Romana in the Roman empire for 190 or 206 years Movements and activism Pacifism Main article Pacifism Pacifism is the categorical opposition to any forms of war or violence as means of settling disputes or gaining advantage Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved to calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war to opposition to any organization of society through governmental force anarchist or libertarian pacifism to rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political economic or social goals to opposition to violence under any circumstance including defense of self and others Pacifism may be based on moral principles a deontological view or pragmatism a consequentialist view Principled pacifism holds that violence of any form is an inappropriate response to conflict and is morally wrong Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and interpersonal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found Pacifists in general reject theories of Just War Organizations United Nations Main article United Nations The United Nations UN is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law international security economic development social progress human rights and achieving world peace The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations to stop wars between countries and to provide a platform for dialogue See also List of United Nations peacekeeping missions The UN after approval by the Security Council sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities Since the UN does not maintain its own military peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN The forces also called the Blue Helmets who enforce UN accords are awarded United Nations Medals which are considered international decorations instead of military decorations The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988 League of Nations The principal forerunner of the United Nations was the League of Nations It was created at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and emerged from the advocacy of Woodrow Wilson and other idealists during World War I The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the League was based in Geneva until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s for example amongst members of the League of Nations Union gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany Fascist Italy and Japan One of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir Alfred Zimmern Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League such as Gilbert Murray and Florence Stawell the socalled Greece and peace set he came to this from the study of the classics The creation of the League of Nations and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues expressed for example by the Union for Democratic Control during World War I also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs such as the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House in London At the same time the academic study of international relations started to professionalize with the creation of the first professorship of international politics named for Woodrow Wilson at Aberystwyth Wales in 1919 Olympic Games The late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the Nobel Peace Prize the Rhodes Scholarships the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and ultimately the League of Nations also saw the reemergence of the ancient Olympic ideal Led by Pierre de Coubertin this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the modern Olympic Games Nobel Peace Prize Main article Nobel

outstanding students from the United States Germany and much of the British Empire Cecil Rhodes wrote in 1901 that the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie This peace purpose of the Rhodes Scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century and became prominent again in recent years under Warden of the Rhodes House Donald Markwell a historian of thought about the causes of war and peace This vision greatly influenced Senator J William Fulbright in the goal of the Fulbright fellowships to promote international understanding and peace and has guided many other international fellowship programs including the Schwarzman Scholars to China created by Stephen A Schwarzman in

international level Smaller institutions Randolph Bourne Institute The McGill Middle East Program of Civil Society and Peace Building International Festival of Peace Poetry Monuments The following are monuments to peace Theories Many different theories of peace exist in the world of peace studies which involves the study of conflict transformation disarmament and cessation of violence The definition of peace can vary with religion culture or subject of study One definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences tolerance persists conflicts are resolved through dialog peoples rights are respected and their voices are heard and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension Game theory Main article Peace war game The Peace War Game is a game theory approach to peace and conflict studies An iterated game originally played in academic groups and by computer simulation for years to study possible strategies of cooperation and aggression As peace makers became richer over time it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated The only strategy that acquired wealth more rapidly was a Genghis Khan a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources This led to the development of the provokable nice guy strategy a peacemaker until attacked improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked Multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor Balance of power theories Main article Balance of power international relations The classical realist position is that the key to promoting order between states and so of increasing the chances of peace is the maintenance of a balance of power between states a situation where no state is so dominant that it can lay down the law to the rest Exponents of this view have included Metternich Bismarck Hans Morgenthau and Henry Kissinger A related approach more in the tradition of Hugo Grotius than Thomas Hobbes was articulated by the socalled English school of international relations theory such as Martin Wight in his book Power Politics 1946 1978 and Hedley Bull in The Anarchical Society 1977 As the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for hegemony In the second half of the 20th century and especially during the cold war a particular form of balance of power mutual nuclear deterrence emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace and that the nuclear umbrella made it safe for smaller wars eg the Vietnam war and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia to end the Prague Spring so making such wars more likely Democratic peace theory Main article Democratic peace theory The democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another Peace free trade interdependence and globalization It was a central tenet of classical liberalism for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century that free trade promoted peace For example the Cambridge economist John Maynard Keynes 18831946 said that he was brought up on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s During the economic globalization in the decades leading up to World War I writers such as Norman Angell argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely He made this argument in 1914 These ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century These ideas have seen capitalism as consistent with even conducive to peace Peace socialism capitalism and managed capitalism Socialist communist and leftwing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries eg Lenin JA Hobson John Strachey argued that capitalism caused war eg through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace However in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war the economist John Maynard Keynes 18831946 argued that managed capitalism could promote peace This involved international coordination of fiscalmonetary policies an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other and a high degree of freedom of trade These ideas underlay Keyness work during World War II that led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at Bretton Woods in 1944 and later of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade subsequently the World Trade Organization Theory of active peace Borrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist Johan Galtung one of the pioneers of the field of Peace Research on Positive Peace and on the writings of Maine Quaker Gray Cox a consortium of theorists activists and practitioners in the experimental John Woolman College initiative have arrived at a theory of active peace This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad which also includes justice and wholeness or wellbeing an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word shalom Furthermore the consortium have integrated Galtungs teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking peacekeeping and peacebuilding to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure Vermont Quaker John V Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals communities and societies whereby one transcends first the surface awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues emerging successively into acquiescence pacifism passive resistance active resistance and finally into active peace dedicating themselves to peacemaking peacekeeping andor peace building Peace international organization and international law One of the most influential theories of peace especially since Woodrow Wilson led the creation of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of international law promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations the United Nations and other functional international organizations One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir Alfred Zimmern for example in his 1936 book The League of Nations and the Rule of Law Transnational solidarity Many idealist thinkers about international relations eg in the traditions of Kant and Karl Marx have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples or classes of people spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war One version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students an idea most powerfully advanced by Cecil Rhodes in the creation of the Rhodes Scholarships and his successors such as J William Fulbright Another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources Many peaces Following Wolfgang Dietrich Wolfgang Sützl and the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and allencompassing definition of peace Rather they promote the idea of many peaces They argue that since no singular correct definition of peace can exist peace should be perceived as a plurality This postmodern understanding of peaces was based on the philosophy of Jean Francois Lyotard It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of transrational peaces and elicitive conflict transformation Transrational peaces In 2008 Wolfgang Dietrich enlarged his earlier approach of the many peaces to the socalled five families of peace interpretations the energetic moral modern postmodern and transrational approach Transrationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culturebased manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations The systemic understanding of transrational peaces advocates a clientcentred method of conflict transformation the socalled elicitive approach Peace without weapons The theory of peace without weapons is as old as philosophy and human consciousness This theory holds that weapons per se are a threat to peace and a removal of all weapons is the way to everlasting peace Peace and conflict studies Main article Peace and conflict studies Peace and conflict studies is an academic field which identifies and analyses violent and nonviolent behaviours as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non violent social conflicts This is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable human condition One variation Peace studies irenology is an interdisciplinary effort aiming at the prevention deescalation and solution of conflicts This contrasts with war studies polemology directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts Disciplines involved may include political science geography economics psychology sociology international relations history anthropology religious studies and gender studies as well as a variety of other disciplines Measuring and ranking peace Although peace is widely perceived as something intangible various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it The Global Peace Index produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the presenceabsence of violence The last edition of the Index ranks 162 countries on their internal and external levels of peace According to the 2015 Global Peace Index Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Syria is the least peaceful one Fragile States Indexformerly known as the Failed States Index created by the Fund for Peace focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics social economy and military facets in countries The 2015 Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan and the least fragile one is Finland University of Maryland publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a threeyear period The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation Besides indicated above reports from the Institute for Economics and Peace Fund for Peace and University of Maryland other organizations like the Economist Intelligence Unit and George Mason
