 This article is about profit motive For profit in economics and political economy see Profit economics In economics the profit motive is the motivation of firms that operate so as to maximize their profits Mainstream microeconomic theory posits that the ultimate goal of a business is to make money Stated differently the reason for a business’s existence is to turn a profit The profit motive is a key tenet of rational choice theory or the theory that economic agents tend to pursue what is in their own best interests Accordingly businesses seek to benefit themselves andor their shareholders by maximizing profits As it extends beyond economics into ideology the profit motive has been a great matter of contention Economics The profit motive ensures that resources are being allocated efficiently For instance Austrian economist Henry Hazlitt explains “If there is no profit in making an article it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself In other words profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing Theoretically in free and competitive markets maximizing profits ensures that resources are not wasted Free and competitive markets rarely exist in reality so market intervention is required to ensure maintenance of the profit efficiency of an economy The profit motive is a good of value to the economy It is needed to provide incentive to generate efficiency and innovation However overremuneration of the profit motive creates profit inefficiency Criticisms The majority of criticisms against the profit motive center on the idea that profits should not supersede the needs of people Michael Moore’s film Sicko for example attacks the healthcare industry for its alleged emphasis on profits at the expense of patients Moore explains Another common criticism of the profit motive is that it is believed to encourage selfishness and greed Critics of the profit motive contend that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits Countercriticisms Freemarket economists argue that the profit motive coupled with competition actually reduces the final price of an item for consumption rather than raising it They argue that businesses profit by selling a good at a lower price and at a greater volume than the competition Economist Thomas Sowell uses supermarkets as an example to illustrate this point “It has been estimated that a supermarket makes a clear profit of about a penny on a dollar of sales If that sounds pretty skimpy remember that it is collecting that penny on every dollar at several cash registers simultaneously and in many cases around the clock” Economist Milton Friedman has argued that greed and selfinterest are universal human traits On a 1979 episode of The Phil Donahue Show Friedman states “The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests” He continues by explaining that only in capitalist countries where individuals can pursue their own selfinterest people have been able to escape from “grinding poverty” Author and philosopher Ayn Rand defended selfishness on ethical grounds Her nonfiction work The Virtue of Selfishness argues that selfishness is a moral good and not an excuse to act with disregard for others See also Incentive References Hazlitt Henry The Function of Profits Economics in One Lesson Ludwig Von Mises Institute Web 22 Apr 2013 Press Room Michaelmoorecom Michael Moore Web 22 Apr 2013 Ballasy Nicholas Michael Moore ‘Its Absolutely a Good Thing’ for Government to Drive Private Health Insurance Out of Business Michael Moore Its Absolutely a Good Thing for Government to Drive Private Health Insurance Out of Business CNS News 02 Oct 2009 Web 22 Apr 2013 Occupy Wall Street Protests Give Voice to Anger Over Greed Corporate Culture PBScom PBS 5 Oct 2011 Web 22 Apr 2013 Sowell Thomas Profit Motive Underrated By Intelligentsia Sunsentinelcom SunSentinel 26 Dec 2003 Web 22 Apr 2013 Pantin Travis Milton Friedman Answers Phil Donahues Charges Nysuncom The New York Sun 12 Nov 2007 Web 22 Apr 2013 Rand Ayn and Nathaniel Branden Introduction The Virtue of Selfishness A New Concept of Egoism New York Signet Book 1964 Ix Print
