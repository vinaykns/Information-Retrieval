 Further information 1979 world oil market chronology The 1979 or second oil crisis or oil shock occurred in the United States due to decreased oil output in the wake of the Iranian Revolution Despite the fact that global oil supply decreased by only 4 widespread panic resulted driving the price far higher The price of crude oil more than doubled to 3950 per barrel over the next 12 months and long lines once again appeared at gas stations as they had in the 1973 oil crisis In 1980 following the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War oil production in Iran nearly stopped and Iraqs oil production was severely cut as well Economic recessions were triggered in the US and other countries Oil prices did not subside to precrisis levels until the mid1980s After 1980 oil prices began a 20year decline eventually reaching a 60 percent falloff during the 1990s As with the 1973 crisis global politics and power balance were impacted Oil exporters such as Mexico Nigeria and Venezuela expanded production the USSR became the top world producer North Sea and Alaskan oil flooded the market and OPEC lost influence Iran See also Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War Amid massive protests the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled his country in early 1979 and the Ayatollah Khomeini soon became the new leader of Iran Protests severely disrupted the Iranian oil sector with production being greatly curtailed and exports suspended In November 1978 a strike by 37000 workers at Irans nationalized oil refineries initially reduced production from 6 million barrels 950000 m per day to about 15 million barrels 240000 m Foreign workers including skilled oil workers fled the country On January 16 1979 the Shah and his wife left Iran at the behest of Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar a longtime opposition leader himself who sought to calm the situation Effects Other OPEC members The rise in oil price benefited other OPEC members which made record profits When oil exports were later resumed under the new Iranian government they were inconsistent and at a lower volume pushing prices up Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations under the presidency of Mana Al Otaiba increased production to offset most of the decline and in early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was about 4 percent OPEC failed to hold on to its preeminent position especially after Iran and Iraq went to war in 1980 and caused a further 10 drop in worldwide production – and by 1981 OPEC production was surpassed by other exporters Additionally its own member nations were divided among themselves Saudi Arabia a swing producer trying to gain back market share after 1985 increased production and caused downward pressure on prices making highcost oil production facilities less profitable or even unprofitable United States The oil crisis had mixed effects in the United States due to some parts of the country being oilproducing regions and other parts being oilconsuming regions Richard Nixon had imposed price controls on domestic oil Gasoline controls were repealed but controls on domestic US oil remained The Jimmy Carter administration began a phased deregulation of oil prices on April 5 1979 when the average price of crude oil was US1585 per barrel 42 US gallons 160 L Starting with the Iranian revolution the price of crude oil rose to 3950 per barrel over the next 12 months its alltime highest real price until March 3 2008 Deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed US oil output to rise sharply from the large Prudhoe Bay fields while oil imports fell sharply And although not directly related the neardisaster at Three Mile Island on March 28 1979 also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability Due to memories of oil shortage in 1973 motorists soon began panic buying and long lines appeared at gas stations as they had six years earlier during the 1973 oil crisis As the average vehicle of the time consumed between two and three liters about 0508 gallons of gasoline petrol an hour while idling it was estimated that Americans wasted up to 150000 barrels 24000 m of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at gas stations During the period many people believed the oil companies artificially created oil shortages to drive up prices rather than factors beyond human control or the US own price controls The amount of oil sold in the United States in 1979 was only 35 percent less than the record set for oil sold the year previously A telephone poll of 1600 American adults conducted by the Associated Press and NBC News and released in early May 1979 found that only 37 of Americans thought the energy shortages were real 9 were not sure and 54 thought the energy shortages were a hoax Many politicians proposed gas rationing one such proponent was Harry Hughes Governor of Maryland who proposed oddeven rationing only people with an oddnumbered license plate could purchase gas on an oddnumbered day as was used during the 1973 Oil Crisis Several states actually implemented oddeven gas rationing including California Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Oregon and Texas Coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis On July 15 1979 President Carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his Crisis of Confidence speech sometimes known as the malaise speech It is often said that during the speech Carter wore a cardigan he actually wore a blue suit and encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy He had already installed solar hot water panels on the roof of the White House and a woodburning stove in the living quarters However the panels were removed in 1986 reportedly for roof maintenance during the administration of his successor Ronald Reagan Carters speech argued the oil crisis was the moral equivalent of war Critics then and now argued that his varied proposals would make the situation worse not better In November 1979 Iranian revolutionaries seized the American Embassy and Carter imposed an embargo against Iranian oil In January 1980 he issued the Carter Doctrine declaring An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States Additionally as part of his administrations efforts at deregulation Carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the administration of Richard Nixon before the 1973 crisis Carter agreed to remove price controls in phases they were finally dismantled in 1981 under Reagan Carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies While the regulated price of domestic oil was kept to 6 a barrel the world market price was 30 In 1980 the US Government established the Synthetic Fuels Corporation to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels When the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980 the oilproducing areas of Texas Oklahoma Louisiana Colorado Wyoming and Alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows Other oilconsuming nations In response to the high oil prices of the 1970s industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal natural gas or nuclear power national governments initiated multibilliondollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil and commercial exploration developed major nonOPEC oilfields in Siberia Alaska North Sea and Gulf of Mexico By 1986 daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels nonOPEC production rose by an evenlarger amount and OPECs market share sank from 50 in 1979 to just 29 in 1985 Automobile fuel economy Main article Fuel economy in automobiles See also Malaise era At the time Detroits Big Three automakers Ford Chrysler GM were marketing downsized fullsized automobiles like the Chevrolet Caprice the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and the Dodge St Regis which met the CAFE fuel economy mandates passed in 1978 Detroits response to the growing popularity of imported compacts like the Toyota Corolla and the Volkswagen Rabbit were the Chevrolet Citation and the Ford Fairmont Ford replaced the Ford Pinto with the Ford Escort and Chrysler on the verge of bankruptcy introduced the Dodge Aries K GM was having unfavorable market reactions to the Citation and introduced the Chevrolet Corsica and Chevrolet Beretta in 1987 which did sell better GM also replaced the Chevrolet Monza introducing the 1982 Chevrolet Cavalier which was better received Ford experienced a similar market rejection of the Fairmont and introduced the front wheel drive Ford Tempo in 1984 Checker Motors known for its iconic Marathon sedans used for the taxicab livery ceased its automotive production in 1982 transitioning to stamping sheetmetal for GM American Motors the final independent manufacturer outside of Detroits Big Three entered into a joint venture with Renault where its mass market automobiles were sold alongside the remaining AMC product lineup which have declined in sales while AMCs Jeep division was profiting especially with the introduction of its downsized XJ sport utilities which led to the companys demise its homegrown compacts dating back to 1970 they were phased out in 1983 with the exception of the Eagle 4WD wagon making it the final AMC designed product and financial woes with the Renault partnership ended the reign of the final independent Renault ended up owning 100 of AMC in 1982 resulting in the divestment of AM General until late 1986 where they sold AMCs shares to Chrysler Corporation they later absorbed AMC in late 1987 where the Jeep division is now part of Chrysler now FCA automobiles Detroit was not well prepared for the sudden rise in fuel prices and imported brands primarily the Asian marques which were mass marketed and had a lower manufacturing cost as opposed to British and West German brands the rising value of the Deutsche Mark and English Pound resulted in the transition to the rise of Japanese manufacturers where exporting their product from Japan at a lower cost would yield profitable gains despite accusations of price dumping were now more widely available in North America and had developed a loyal customer base the Japanese Big Three launched their respective advertisement campaigns Honda with its We Make It Simple tagline Datsun Nissan after 1984 with the tagline We Are Driven and Toyota with Oh What A Feeling they ran a previous ad campaign prior to 1979 where the company mocked the Plymouth Volare with the tagline You Asked For It You Got It luring away traditional Big Three consumers Subaru in the late 1970s ran an ad campaign where former owners of a Big Three automobile drove their products one TV ad started with the tagline Ford drives Subaru A year after the 1979 Iranian Revolution Japanese manufacturers surpassed Detroits production totals becoming first in the world Japanese exports would later displace the automotive market once dominated by lowered tier European manufacturers Alfa Romeo Fiat Opel Peugeot MG Triumph Citroen some would declare bankruptcy eg Triumph Simca or withdraw from the US market especially in the wake of grey market automobiles or the inability of the vehicle to meet DOT requirements from emission requirements to automotive lighting Many imported brands utilized fuel saving technologies such as fuel injection and multivalve engines over the common use of carburetors Also the imported brands used their innovative business ethic eg a justintime inventory system but the US Government imposed import quotas where the Japanese brands later extended to South Korean and European marques began outsourcing their operations by opening assembly plants in the United States especially the Southern US where import automakers were not on friendly terms with labor unions from the Rust Belt states Canada and Mexico to produce their mass market automobiles and light trucks Import brands also complied with local content laws where an import automobile must have a percentage of automotive components in the United States automobiles with 70 percent local content manufacture is considered a domestic build regardless of manufacturer sourced from the United States Canada or Mexico prior to the establishment of NAFTA and the American Automobile Labeling Act of 1994 which mandated the percentage of automotive parts content printed on the Monroney sticker of an automobile sold through a dealership The import quota resulted in the Japanese automakers importing a limited amount of automobiles but to comply with the US Government imposition of the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints the automakers established their respective luxury marques Acura Lexus Infiniti but run respectively by their parent manufacturers Honda Toyota Nissan GMs Cadillac division experimented with their V864 power plant the ancestor of the modernday Active Fuel Management andor variable displacement which was a market failure Nonetheless overall fuel economy increased which was one factor
