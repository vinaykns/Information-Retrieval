Latin lingua latīna IPA ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈtiːna is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the IndoEuropean languages The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet Latin was originally spoken in Latium in the Italian Peninsula Through the power of the Roman Republic it became the dominant language initially in Italy and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages such as Italian Portuguese Spanish French and Romanian Latin Italian and French have contributed many words to the English language Latin and Ancient Greek roots are used in theology biology and medicine By the late Roman Republic 75 BC Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and Medieval Latin the language used from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin Later Early Modern Latin and Modern Latin evolved Latin was used as the language of international communication scholarship and science until well into the 18th century when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church Today many students scholars and members of the Catholic clergy speak Latin fluently It is taught in primary secondary and postsecondary educational institutions around the world Latin is a highly inflected language with three distinct genders seven noun cases four verb conjugations four verb principal parts six tenses three persons three moods two voices two aspects and two numbers Legacy The language has been passed down through various forms Inscriptions Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed monumental multivolume series the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum CIL Authors and publishers vary but the format is about the same volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy About 270000 inscriptions are known Literature The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology They are in part the subject matter of the field of classics Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions such as the Loeb Classical Library published by Harvard University Press or the Oxford Classical Texts published by Oxford University Press Latin translations of modern literature such as The Hobbit Treasure Island Robinson Crusoe Paddington Bear Winnie the Pooh The Adventures of Tintin Asterix Harry Potter Walter the Farting Dog Le Petit Prince Max and Moritz How the Grinch Stole Christmas The Cat in the Hat and a book of fairy tales fabulae mirabiles are intended to garner popular interest in the language Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin such as Meissners Latin Phrasebook Linguistics The Latin influence in English has been significant at all stages of its insular development In the Middle Ages borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century or indirectly after the Norman Conquest through the AngloNorman language From the 16th to the 18th centuries English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words dubbed inkhorn terms as if they had spilled from a pot of ink Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten but some useful ones survived such as imbibe and extrapolate Many of the most common polysyllabic English words are of Latin origin through the medium of Old French Romance words make respectively 59 20 and 14 of English German and Dutch vocabularies Those figures can rise dramatically when only noncompound and nonderived words are included Accordingly Romance words make roughly 35 of the vocabulary of Dutch The influence of Roman governance and Roman technology on the lessdeveloped nations under Roman dominion made those nations adopted Latin phraseology in some specialized areas such as science technology medicine and law For example the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by Historia Naturalis an encyclopedia of people places plants animals and things published by Pliny the Elder Roman medicine recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen established that todays medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words the Greek being filtered through the Latin Roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms A few international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin Interlingua is sometimes considered a simplified modern version of the language Latino sine Flexione popular in the early 20th century is Latin with its inflections stripped away among other grammatical changes One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin comparing phonology inflection discourse syntax vocabulary and intonation indicated the following percentages the higher the percentage the greater the distance from Latin Sardinian 8 Italian 12 Spanish 20 Romanian 235 Occitan 25 Portuguese 31 and French 44 Education Throughout European history an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles Instruction in Latin is an essential aspect In todays world a large number of Latin students in the US learn from Wheelocks Latin The Classic Introductory Latin Course Based on Ancient Authors This book first published in 1956 was written by Frederic M Wheelock who received a PhD from Harvard University Wheelocks Latin has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses The Living Latin movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught as a means of both spoken and written communication It is available at the Vatican and at some institutions in the US such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels such as the Cambridge Latin Course series It has also published a subseries of childrens texts in Latin by Bell Forte which recounts the adventures of a mouse called Minimus In the United Kingdom the Classical Association encourages the study of antiquity through various means such as publications and grants The University of Cambridge the Open University a number of prestigious independent schools for example Eton and Harrow and Via Facilis a Londonbased charity run Latin courses In the United States and in Canada the American Classical League supports every effort to further the study of classics Its subsidiaries include the National Junior Classical League with more than 50000 members which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin and the National Senior Classical League which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college The league also sponsors the National Latin Exam Classicist Mary Beard wrote in The Times Literary Supplement in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it Official status Latin was or is the official language of European states  Holy See – used in the diocese with Italian being the official language of Vatican City  Hungary Latin was the sole official language of the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11th century to the mid 19th century when it was replaced by Hungarian in 1844 The best known Latin language poet originating from Hungary was Janus Pannonius  Croatia – Latin was the official language of Croatian Parliament Sabor from the 13th to the 19th century 1847 The oldest preserved records of the parliamentary sessions Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis – held in Zagreb Zagabria Croatia – date from 19 April 1273 An extensive Croatian Latin literature exists  Poland – officially recognised and widely used between the 9th and 18th centuries commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility History Main article History of Latin A number of historical phases of the language have been recognised each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary usage spelling morphology and syntax There are no hard and fast rules of classification different scholars emphasise different features As a result the list has variants as well as alternative names In addition to the historical phases Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church as well as by Protestant scholars from Late Antiquity onward After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 and Germanic kingdoms took its place the Germanic people adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other formal uses Old Latin Main article Old Latin The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin which was spoken from the Roman Kingdom to the middle of the Roman Republic period It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works such as the comedies of Plautus and Terence The Latin alphabet was devised from the Etruscan alphabet The writing later changed from an initial righttoleft or boustrophedon to a lefttoright script Classical Latin Main article Classical Latin During the late republic and into the first years of the empire a new Classical Latin arose a conscious creation of the orators poets historians and other literate men who wrote the great works of classical literature which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools Todays instructional grammars trace their roots to such schools which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech Vulgar Latin Main articles Vulgar Latin and Late Latin Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works such as those of Plautus which contain snippets of everyday speech indicates that a spoken language Vulgar Latin termed sermo vulgi the speech of the masses by Cicero existed at the same time as the literate Classical Latin The informal language was rarely written so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti As it was free to develop on its own there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically On the contrary romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language The Decline of the Roman Empire meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about Late Latin a postclassical stage of the language seen in Christian writings of the time It was more in line with the everyday speech not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses Despite the dialect variation which is found in any widespread language the languages of Spain France Portugal and Italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common Christian Roman Catholic culture It was not until the Moorish conquest of Spain in 711 cut off communications between the major Romance regions that the languages began to diverge seriously The Vulgar Latin dialect that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties as it was largely cut off from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire One way to determine whether a Romance language feature was in Vulgar Latin is to compare it with its parallel in Classical Latin If it was not preferred in Classical Latin then it most likely came from the invisible contemporaneous Vulgar Latin For example Romance horse cavallochevalcaballocavalo came from Latin caballus However Classical Latin used equus Caballus therefore was most likely the spoken form Vulgar Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear They were throughout the period confined to everyday speech as Medieval Latin was used for writing Medieval Latin Main article Medieval Latin Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages however in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base Moreover this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin such as the Germanic and Slavic nations It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies Without the institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion for example in classical Latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive which are compound tenses Medieval Latin might use fui and fueram instead Furthermore the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail Renaissance Latin Main article Renaissance Latin The Renaissance briefly reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken language by its adoption by the Renaissance Humanists Often led by members of the clergy they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature They strove to preserve what they could and restore Latin to what it had been and introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts By no later than the 15th century they had replaced Medieval Latin with versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities who attempted by scholarship to discover what the classical language had been New Latin Main article New Latin During the Early Modern Age Latin still was the most important language of culture in Europe Therefore until the end of the 17th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin Afterwards most diplomatic documents were written in French and later just native or other languages Contemporary Latin Main article Contemporary Latin The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasiofficial contexts is the Catholic Church Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite the Tridentine Mass is celebrated in Latin Although the Mass of Paul VI is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language it can be and often is said in Latin in part or whole especially at multilingual gatherings It is the official language of the Holy See the primary language of its public journal the Acta Apostolicae Sedis and the working language of the Roman Rota Vatican City is also home to the worlds only automatic teller machine that gives instructions in Latin In the pontifical universities postgraduate courses of Canon law are taught in Latin and papers are written in the same language In the Anglican Church after the publication of the Book of Common Prayer of 1559 a Latin edition was published in 1560 for use at universities such as Oxford and the leading public schools English private academies where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin and there have been several Latin translations since Most recently a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer has appeared Some films of ancient settings such as Sebastiane and The Passion of the Christ have been made with dialogue in Latin for the sake of realism Occasionally Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy in such filmtelevision series as The Exorcist and Lost Jughead Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin There are also songs written with Latin lyrics The libretto for the operaoratorio Oedipus rex opera by Igor Stravinsky is in Latin Switzerland adopts the countrys Latin short name Helvetia on coins and stamps since there is no room to use all of the nations four official languages For a similar reason it adopted the international vehicle and internet code CH which stands for Confoederatio Helvetica the countrys full Latin name Many organizations today have Latin mottos such as Semper paratus always ready the motto of the United States Coast Guard and Semper fidelis always faithful the motto of the United States Marine Corps Several of the states of the United States also have Latin mottos such as Qui transtulit sustinet He who transplanted still sustains the state motto of Connecticut Ad astra per aspera To the stars through hardships that of Kansas Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice If you seek a pleasant peninsula look about you that of Michigan Salus populi suprema lex esto The health of the people should be the highest law that of Missouri Esse quam videri To be rather than to seem that of North Carolina Sic semper tyrannis Thus always for tyrants that of Virginia and Montani semper liberi Mountaineers are always free that of West Virginia Another Latin motto is Per ardua ad astra Through adversitystruggle to the stars the motto of the Royal Air Force RAF Some schools adopt Latin mottos for example Harvard Universitys motto is Veritas meaning truth Veritas was the goddess of truth a daughter of Saturn and the mother of Virtue Similarly Canadas motto A mari usque ad mare from sea to sea and most provincial mottos are also in Latin British Columbias is Splendor Sine Occasu splendor without diminishment Occasionally some media outlets broadcast in Latin which is targeted at enthusiasts Notable examples include Radio Bremen in Germany YLE radio in Finland and Vatican Radio Television all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin There are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts The Latin Wikipedia has more than 100000 articles written in Latin Latin is taught in many high schools especially in Europe and the Americas It is most common in British public schools and grammar schools the Italian liceo classico and liceo scientifico the German Humanistisches Gymnasium and the Dutch gymnasium In the United States it is taught in Baltimore City College Boston Latin Academy Boston Latin School Brooklyn Latin School Central High School of Philadelphia English High School of Boston Norwell High School Massachusetts and Oak Hall School Phonology Main article Latin spelling and pronunciation No inherited verbal knowledge of the ancient pronunciation of Latin exists so it must be reconstructed Among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors misspellings puns ancient etymologies and the spelling of Latin loanwords in other languages Consonants The consonant phonemes of Classical Latin are shown in the following table In Old and Classical Latin the Latin alphabet had no distinction between uppercase and lowercase and the letters ⟨J U W⟩ did not exist In place of ⟨J U⟩ ⟨I V⟩ were used ⟨I V⟩ represented both vowels and consonants Most of the letterforms were similar to modern uppercase as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article The spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts however normally use ⟨i u⟩ in place of Classicalera ⟨i v⟩ Some systems use ⟨j v⟩ for the consonant sounds j w except in the combinations ⟨gu su qu⟩ for which ⟨v⟩ is never used Some notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below Doubled consonants in Latin are pronounced long In English consonants are pronounced double only between two words or morphemes as in unnamed which has a doubled nn like the nn in Latin annus Vowels Simple vowels In Classical Latin the letter ⟨U⟩ was written as ⟨V⟩ even if it was used as a vowel ⟨Y⟩ was adopted to represent upsilon in loanwords from Greek but it was pronounced like ⟨u⟩ and ⟨i⟩ by some speakers It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning such as sylva and ὕλη Classical Latin distinguished between long and short vowels Then long vowels except for ⟨I⟩ were frequently marked using the apex which was sometimes similar to an acute accent ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩ Long iː was written using a taller version of ⟨I⟩ called i longa long I ⟨ꟾ⟩ In modern texts long vowels are often indicated by a macron ⟨ā ē ī ō ū⟩ and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words when they are marked with a breve ⟨ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ⟩ Long vowels in Classical Latin were pronounced with a different quality from short vowels and also were longer The difference is described in table below A vowel and ⟨m⟩ at the end of a word or a vowel and ⟨n⟩ before ⟨s⟩ or ⟨f⟩ was long and nasal as in monstrum mõːstrũː Diphthongs Classical Latin had several diphthongs The two most common were ⟨ae au⟩ ⟨oe⟩ was fairly rare and ⟨ui eu ei ou⟩ were very rare at least in native Latin words The sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in aēnus aˈeːnʊs of bronze and coēpit kɔˈeːpɪt began and ⟨au ui eu ei ou⟩ represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels j w in cavē ˈkaweː beware cuius ˈkʊjjʊs whose monuī ˈmɔnʊiː I warned solvī ˈsɔɫwiː I released dēlēvī deːˈleːwiː I destroyed eius ˈɛjjʊs his and novus ˈnɔwʊs new Old Latin had more diphthongs but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin The Old Latin diphthong ⟨ai⟩ and the sequence ⟨āī⟩ became Classical ⟨ae⟩ Old Latin ⟨oi⟩ and ⟨ou⟩ changed to Classical ⟨ū⟩ except in a few words whose ⟨oi⟩ became Classical ⟨oe⟩ These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root for instance Classical poena punishment and pūnīre to punish Early Old Latin ⟨ei⟩ usually changed to Classical ⟨ī⟩ In Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages ⟨ae au oe⟩ merged with ⟨e ō ē⟩ A similar pronunciation also existed during the Classical Latin period for lesseducated speakers Orthography Main article Latin alphabet Latin was written in the Latin alphabet derived from the Old Italic script which was in turn drawn from the Greek alphabet and ultimately the Phoenician alphabet This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance Celtic Germanic Baltic Finnic and many Slavic languages Polish Slovak Slovene Croatian and Czech and it has been adopted by many languages around the world including Vietnamese the Austronesian languages many Turkic languages and most languages in subSaharan Africa the Americas and Oceania making it by far the worlds single most widely used writing system The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet it contained only 21 letters Later G was added to represent ɡ which had previously been spelled C and Z ceased to be included in the alphabet as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative The letters Y and Z were later added to represent Greek letters upsilon and zeta respectively in Greek loanwords W was created in the 11th century from VV It represented w in Germanic languages not Latin which still uses V for the purpose J was distinguished from the original I only during the late Middle Ages as was the letter U from V Although some Latin dictionaries use J it is rarely used for Latin text as it was not used in classical times but many other languages use it Classical Latin did not contain sentence punctuation letter case or interword spacing but apices were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the interpunct was used at times to separate words The first line of Catullus 3 originally written as or with interpunct as would be rendered in a modern edition as or with macrons The Roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on Hadrians Wall in Britain Curiously enough most of the Vindolanda tablets show spaces between words but spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era Alternate scripts Occasionally Latin has been written in other scripts The Praeneste fibula is a 7thcentury BC pin with an Old Latin inscription written using the Etruscan script The rear panel of the early 8thcentury Franks Casket has an inscription that switches from Old English in AngloSaxon runes to Latin in Latin script and to Latin in runes Grammar Main articles Latin grammar and Latin syntax Latin is a synthetic fusional language in the terminology of linguistic typology In more traditional terminology it is an inflected language but typologists are apt to say inflecting Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements amō I love is produced from a semantic element ama love to which ō a first person singular marker is suffixed The grammatical function can be changed by changing the markers the word is inflected to express different grammatical functions but the semantic element does not change Inflection uses affixing and infixing Affixing is prefixing and suffixing Latin inflections are never prefixed For example amābit he or she or it will love is formed from the same stem amā to which a future tense marker bi is suffixed and a third person singular marker t is suffixed There is an inherent ambiguity t may denote more than one grammatical category masculine feminine or neuter gender A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context All natural languages contain ambiguities of one sort or another The inflections express gender number and case in adjectives nouns and pronouns a process called declension Markers are also attached to fixed stems of verbs to denote person number tense voice mood and aspect a process called conjugation Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process such as adverbs prepositions and interjections Nouns Main article Latin declension A regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions a group of nouns with similar inflected forms The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun The first declension with a predominant ending letter of a is signified by the genitive singular ending of ae The second declension with a predominant ending letter of o is signified by the genitive singular ending of i The third declension with a predominant ending letter of i is signified by the genitive singular ending of is The fourth declension with a predominant ending letter of u is signified by the genitive singular ending of ūs The fifth declension with a predominant ending letter of e is signified by the genitive singular ending of ei There are seven Latin noun cases which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a nouns syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections Thus word order is not as important in Latin as it is in English which is less inflected The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary The cases are as follows Nominative – used when the noun is the subject or a predicate nominative The thing or person acting the girl ran puella cucurrit or cucurrit puella Genitive – used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object the horse of the man or the mans horse in both instances the word man would be in the genitive case when it is translated into Latin It also indicates the partitive in which the material is quantified a group of people a number of gifts people and gifts would be in the genitive case Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives The cup is full of wine Poculum plēnum vīnī est The master of the slave had beaten him Dominus servī eum verberāverat Dative – used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence with special verbs with certain prepositions and if it is used as agent reference or even possessor The merchant hands the stola to the woman Mercātor fēminae stolam trādit Accusative – used when the noun is the direct object of the subject and as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which The man killed the boy Vir necāvit puerum Ablative – used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source cause agent or instrument or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions adverbial You walked with the boy Cum puerō ambulāvistī Vocative – used when the noun is used in a direct address The vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative but exceptions include seconddeclension nouns ending in us The us becomes an e in the vocative singular If it ends in ius such as fīlius the ending is just ī filī as distinct from the nominative plural filiī in the vocative singular Master shouted the slave Domine clāmāvit servus Locative – used to indicate a location corresponding to the English in or at It is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns such as the word domus house In the singular of the first and second declensions its form coincides with the genitive Roma becomes Romae in Rome In the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions it coincides with the ablative Athēnae becomes Athēnīs at Athens In the fourthdeclension word domus the locative form domī at home differs from the standard form of all other cases Latin lacks both definite and indefinite articles so puer currit can mean either the boy is running or a boy is running Adjectives Main article Latin declension There are two types of regular Latin adjectives first and second declension and thirddeclension They are socalled because their forms are similar or identical to first and seconddeclension and thirddeclension nouns respectively Latin adjectives also have comparative more er and superlative most est forms There are also a number of Latin participles Latin numbers are sometimes declined See Numbers below First and seconddeclension adjectives First and seconddeclension adjectives are declined like firstdeclension nouns for the feminine forms and like seconddeclension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms For example for mortuus mortua mortuum dead mortua is declined like a regular firstdeclension noun such as puella girl mortuus is declined like a regular seconddeclension masculine noun such as dominus lord master and mortuum is declined like a regular seconddeclension neuter noun such as auxilium help First and seconddeclension er adjectives Some first and seconddeclension adjectives have an er as the masculine nominative singular form and are declined like regular first and seconddeclension adjectives Some but not all adjectives keep the e for all of the forms Thirddeclension adjectives Thirddeclension adjectives are mostly declined like normal thirddeclension nouns with a few exceptions In the plural nominative neuter for example the ending is ia omnia all everything and for thirddeclension nouns the plural nominative neuter ending is a or ia capita heads animalia animals They can have one two or three forms for the masculine feminine and neuter nominative singular Participles Latin participles like English participles are formed from a verb There are a few main types of participles Present Active Participles Perfect Passive Participles Future Active Participles and Future Passive Participles Prepositions Latin sometimes uses prepositions depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used Prepositions can take two cases for their object the accusative apud puerum with the boy with puerum being the accusative form of puer boy and the ablative sine puero without the boy puero being the ablative form of puer boy Verbs Main article Latin conjugation A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main conjugations A conjugation is a class of verbs with similar inflected forms The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verbs present stem The present stem can be found by omitting the re rī in deponent verbs ending from the present infinitive form The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in āre or āri active and passive respectively amāre to love hortārī to exhort of the second conjugation by ēre or ērī monēre to warn verērī to fear of the third conjugation by ere ī dūcere to lead ūtī to use of the fourth by īre īrī audīre to hear experīrī to attempt Irregular verbs may not follow the types or may be marked in a different way The endings presented above are not the suffixed infinitive markers The first letter in each case is the last of the stem so the conjugations are also called aconjugation econjugation and iconjugation The fused infinitive ending is re or rī Thirdconjugation stems end in a consonant the consonant conjugation Further there is a subset of the third conjugation the istems which behave somewhat like the fourth conjugation as they are both istems one short and the other long The stem categories descend from IndoEuropean and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other IndoEuropean languages There are six general tenses in Latin present imperfect future perfect pluperfect and future perfect three moods indicative imperative and subjunctive in addition to the infinitive participle gerund gerundive and supine three persons first second and third two numbers singular and plural two voices active and passive and three aspects perfective imperfective and stative Verbs are described by four principal parts The first principal part is the firstperson singular present tense indicative mood active voice form of the verb If the verb is impersonal the first principal part will be in the thirdperson singular The second principal part is the present infinitive active The third principal part is the firstperson singular perfect indicative active form Like the first principal part if the verb is impersonal the third principal part will be in the thirdperson singular The fourth principal part is the supine form or alternatively the nominative singular perfect passive participle form of the verb The fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders us for masculine a for feminine and m for neuter in the nominative singular The fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive Most modern Latin dictionaries if they show only one gender tend to show the masculine but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter as it coincides with the supine The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs but strictly in Latin they can be made passive if they are used impersonally and the supine exists for such verbs There are six tenses in the Latin language These are divided into two tense systems the present system which is made up of the present imperfect and future tenses and the perfect system which is made up of the perfect pluperfect and future perfect tenses Each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person and number referred to Subject nominative pronouns are generally omitted for the first I we and second you persons unless emphasis on the subject is desired The table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses For the future tense the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations The future perfect endings are identical to the future forms of sum with the exception of erint and that the pluperfect endings are identical to the imperfect forms of sum Deponent verbs Some Latin verbs are deponent causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning hortor hortārī hortātus sum to urge Vocabulary As Latin is an Italic language most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic ultimately from the ancestral ProtoIndoEuropean language However because of close cultural interaction the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some Etruscan words into their language including persona mask and histrio actor Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from Oscan another Italic language After the Fall of Tarentum 272 BC the Romans began hellenizing or adopting features of Greek culture including the borrowing of Greek words such as camera vaulted roof sumbolum symbol and balineum bath This hellenization led to the addition of Y and Z to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds Subsequently the Romans transplanted Greek art medicine science and philosophy to Italy paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece Thus many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words as ars craft and τέχνη art Because of the Roman Empires expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words such as beber beaver of Germanic origin and bracae breeches of Celtic origin The specific dialects of Latin across Latinspeaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society Christian vocabulary became a part of the language either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms Continuing into the Middle Ages Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages including Old English and other Germanic languages Over the ages Latinspeaking populations produced new adjectives nouns and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments For example the compound adjective omnipotens allpowerful was produced from the adjectives omnis all and potens powerful by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating Often the concatenation changed the part of speech and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives Phrases The phrases are mentioned with accents to show where stress is placed In Latin most words are stressed at the secondlast penultimate syllable called in Latin paenultima or syllaba paenultima A few words are stressed at the thirdlast syllable called in Latin antepaenultima or syllaba antepaenultima sálve
