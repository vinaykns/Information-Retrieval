 This article is about the physical energy derived biological sources For the idea that all living things contain a bioenergy of a spiritual nature see Energy esotericism Bioenergy is renewable energy made available from materials derived from biological sources Biomass is any organic material which has stored sunlight in the form of chemical energy As a fuel it may include wood wood waste straw manure sugarcane and many other byproducts from a variety of agricultural processes By 2010 there was 35 GW 47000000 hp of globally installed bioenergy capacity for electricity generation of which 7 GW 9400000 hp was in the United States In its most narrow sense it is a synonym to biofuel which is fuel derived from biological sources In its broader sense it includes biomass the biological material used as a biofuel as well as the social economic scientific and technical fields associated with using biological sources for energy This is a common misconception as bioenergy is the energy extracted from the biomass as the biomass is the fuel and the bioenergy is the energy contained in the fuel There is a slight tendency for the word bioenergy to be favoured in Europe compared with biofuel in America Solid biomass Main article Biomass One of the advantages of biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct residue or wasteproduct of other processes such as farming animal husbandry and forestry In theory this means there is no competition between fuel and food production although this is not always the case Land use existing biomass industries and relevant conversion technologies must be considered when evaluating suitability of developing biomass as feedstock for energy Biomass is the material derived from recently living organisms which includes plants animals and their byproducts Manure garden waste and crop residues are all sources of biomass It is a renewable energy source based on the carbon cycle unlike other natural resources such as petroleum coal and nuclear fuels Another source includes Animal waste which is a persistent and unavoidable pollutant produced primarily by the animals housed in industrialsized farms There are also agricultural products specifically being grown for biofuel production These include corn and soybeans and to some extent willow and switchgrass on a precommercial research level primarily in the United States rapeseed wheat sugar beet and willow 15000 ha or 37000 acres in Sweden primarily in Europe sugarcane in Brazil palm oil and miscanthus in Southeast Asia sorghum and cassava in China and jatropha in India Hemp has also been proven to work as a biofuel Biodegradable outputs from industry agriculture forestry and households can be used for biofuel production using eg anaerobic digestion to produce biogas gasification to produce syngas or by direct combustion Examples of biodegradable wastes include straw timber manure rice husks sewage and food waste The use of biomass fuels can therefore contribute to waste management as well as fuel security and help to prevent or slow down climate change although alone they are not a comprehensive solution to these problems Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel Rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas—also called landfill gas or biogas Crops such as corn and sugar cane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol Biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats Also Biomass to liquids BTLs and cellulosic ethanol are still under research Sewage biomass A new bioenergy sewage treatment process aimed at developing countries is now on the horizon the Omni Processor is a selfsustaining process which uses the sewerage solids as fuel to convert sewage waste water into drinking water and electrical energy Electricity generation from biomass The biomass used for electricity production ranges by region Forest byproducts such as wood residues are popular in the United States Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius sugar cane residue and Southeast Asia rice husks Animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter is popular in the UK Electricity from sugarcane bagasse in Brazil Sucrose accounts for little more than 30 of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant 35 is in the leaves and stem tips which are left in the fields during harvest and 35 are in the fibrous material bagasse left over from pressing The production process of sugar and ethanol in Brazil takes full advantage of the energy stored in sugarcane Part of the bagasse is currently burned at the mill to provide heat for distillation and electricity to run the machinery This allows ethanol plants to be energetically selfsufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities current production is 600 MW 800000 hp for selfuse and 100 MW 130000 hp for sale This secondary activity is expected to boom now that utilities have been induced to pay fair price about US10GJ or US0036kWh for 10 year contracts This is approximately half of what the World Bank considers the reference price for investing in similar projects see below The energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low Estimates of potential power generation from bagasse range from 1000 to 9000 MW 1300000 to 12100000 hp depending on technology Higher estimates assume gasification of biomass replacement of current lowpressure steam boilers and turbines by highpressure ones and use of harvest trash currently left behind in the fields For comparison Brazils Angra I nuclear plant generates 657 MW 881000 hp Presently it is economically viable to extract about 288 MJ of electricity from the residues of one tonne of sugarcane of which about 180 MJ are used in the plant itself Thus a mediumsize distillery processing 1000000 tonnes 980000 long tons 1100000 short tons of sugarcane per year could sell about 5 MW 6700 hp of surplus electricity At current prices it would earn US18 million from sugar and ethanol sales and about US1 million from surplus electricity sales With advanced boiler and turbine technology the electricity yield could be increased to 648 MJ per tonne of sugarcane but current electricity prices do not justify the necessary investment According to one report the World Bank would only finance investments in bagasse power generation if the price were at least US19GJ or US0068kWh Bagasse burning is environmentally friendly compared to other fuels like oil and coal Its ash content is only 25 against 30–50 of coal and it contains very little sulfur Since it burns at relatively low temperatures it produces little nitrous oxides Moreover bagasse is being sold for use as a fuel replacing heavy fuel oil in various industries including citrus juice concentrate vegetable oil ceramics and tyre recycling The state of São Paulo alone used 2000000 tonnes 1970000 long tons 2200000 short tons saving about US35 million in fuel oil imports Researchers working with cellulosic ethanol are trying to make the extraction of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and other plants viable on an industrial scale Electricity from electrogenic microorganisms Another form of bioenergy can be attained from microbial fuel cells in which chemical energy stored in wastewater or soil is converted directly into electrical energy via the metabolic processes of electrogenic microorganisms The power generation capability of this technology has not been economical to date however and this technology has found more utility for chemical treatment processes and student education Environmental impact Further information Environmental impact of biodiesel Some forms of forest bioenergy have recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council for the harmful impacts they can have on forests and the climate Greenpeace recently released a report entitled Fuelling a BioMess which outlines their concerns around forest bioenergy Because any part of the tree can be burned the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages WholeTree Harvesting which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting and can be harmful to the longterm health of the forest In some jurisdictions forest biomass is increasingly consisting of elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems including standing trees naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees and even longer in low productivity areas furthermore logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change a number of environmental groups are opposing the largescale use of forest biomass in energy production The New Scientist described a scenario in a September 2016 article which illustrated why the journal believed bioenergy can be bad Suppose you cut down a 50 year oak tree in your garden and use the logs to heat your house instead of coal Wood emits more carbon dioxide than coal per unit of heat gained and the roots left in the soil emit more carbon dioxide as they rot If you plant another tree it will soak up that carbon dioxide in about 50 years But if you had left the original tree in place it would have soaked up the carbon dioxide from the coal and more It could take centuries before cutting down the tree would give any benefit But the world needed to cut carbon dioxide over the next few decades if the global warming was to be kept below 3 degrees C The journal also concluded that official claimed carbon reductions from renewables had been overstated The European Union for example got more 64 of its renewable energy from biomass mostly wood but United Nations and EU rules did not count the carbon emissions from burning biomass See also Energy portal
