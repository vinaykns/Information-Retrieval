 Bridges to Prosperity is a United Statesbased nonprofit organization that builds footbridges and trains local people in developing countries to build pedestrian bridges It was established by Kenneth Frantz in 2001 after seeing a photo in National Geographic Magazine of a broken bridge over the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia with ten men on either side of the broken span pulling themselves across the chasm by rope Bridges to Prosperity is now based in the Denver Colorado area Footbridges are simple and inexpensive enough for rural communities to build with only modest outside help and they provide major benefits such as improved safety and access to markets schools and medical care Typically the training is done through Community Bridge Building programs in which Bridges to Prosperity trains incountry partner organizations or government agencies in both engineering and organizational techniques Since its founding in March 2001 Bridges to Prosperity or their technology has built over 200 footbridges and expanded to 18 countries across Southeast Asia Africa and Central and South America Bridges to Prosperity is supported by and partners with a number of other organizations such as Rotary International Mission Bridges to Prosperity provides isolated communities with access to essential health care education and economic opportunities by building footbridges over impassable rivers History Transport is a crucial driver of development bringing socioeconomic opportunities within the reach of the poor and enabling economies to be more competitive Transport infrastructure connects people to jobs education and health services it enables the supply of goods and services around the world and allows people to interact and generate the knowledge that creates longterm growth Rural roads for example can help prevent maternal deaths through timely access to childbirthrelated care boost girls’ enrollment in school and increase and diversify farmers’ income by connecting them to markets The World Bank estimates that over 1 billion people do not have access to transportation networks B2P determined that positive results could be attained by spreading the technology by building approximately 1020 demonstration bridges per country training locals partnering with local technological institutes providing downloadable easy to use step by step photo and video manuals and supplying free wire rope and wire rope clampsclips for post trainingdemonstration programs As there is much relating to best practices B2P has focused on education and training and the propagation of technical manuals and footbridge building text books Bridges to Prosperity provides the needed capital in the form of free recycled wire rope and strand Best practice dictates that when capital is provided in this manner that there are no unintended consequences eg B2P does not provide free cable to countries where there is an existing or budding wire rope industry Materials are not donated where that would cause unintended harm to existing business In 2005 B2P received a long term donation of free 78 inch to 125 inch wire rope from the ports of Portsmouth and Norfolk Virginia The wire rope donated was American manufactured high tensile steel wire rope used on gantry cranes for unloading container ships Later the port of Baltimore was added as were Texas and west coast ports In 2012 approximately 100000 feet of such donated used wire rope and strand was shipped in an intermodal container to programs all over the world To build one footbridge the average number of feet of wire rope required is approximately 1800 feet Worldwide there is enough recycled wire rope from gantry cranes to build approximately 2500 footbridges every year Each container shipped overseas weighs approximately 52000 pounds and contains 20000 feet of cable Awards Bridges to Prosperity has been recognized by a number of global awards In 2016 B2P was named the 2016 Eurostar Ashden Award for Sustainability and one of the top 10 social enterprises in the world by Classyorg Corporate sponsorship Building on the affinity with construction firms especially those that design and build highway bridges a corporate sponsor program was started to allow employees to form teams to design and build footbridges Today B2P provides cobranded bridge building opportunities for companies around the world ranging from financial services firms to construction industry giants Sponsors include Ross Construction of Palo Alto California Parsons Brinckerhoff of Australia and Flatiron Construction along with Flatirons parent company Hochtief of Germany and Turner Construction USA Rotary An important supporter have been various Rotary International clubs who collaborate in providing Rotary Foundation matched humanitarian grants When Bridges to Prosperity was founded Kenneth Frantz was a member of the Gloucester Point Rotary Club in Gloucester Virginia That club assisted in the purchase of materials for the repair of the Blue Nile Bridge There are now over 65 rotary clubs worldwide and over 800 individual Rotarians who have participated directly in Bridges to Prosperity programs Partnerships with the local developing country rotary clubs such as the Rotary Club of Nkwazi Lusaka Zambia facilitate access and operation in countries with little bureaucratic interference The partnerships with local Rotary clubs allow quick customs clearance of wire rope imports and expedited business contacts allow USA based Rotarians to easily travel and participate in schemes as well as adding a defense against potential corruption University programs Support from CEO Avery Bang’s alma mater the University of Iowa engineering school and nonprofit Continental Crossings has led the construction of three additional bridges There are now over 10 each Bridges to Prosperity university chapters in the USA To start the university program a fund was established by the Signe Ostby and Scott Cook family Other university engineering programs include Arizona State University Colorado School of Mines Duke University Massachusetts Institute of Technology New Mexico State University Rice University University of Colorado at Boulder Notre Dame University of Waterloo Virginia Tech Washington State University Financial information In the fiscal year ending 82012 the organisation had
