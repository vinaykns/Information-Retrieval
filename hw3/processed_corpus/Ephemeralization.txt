 Ephemeralization a term coined by R Buckminster Fuller is the ability of technological advancement to do more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing that is an accelerating increase in the efficiency of achieving the same or more output products services information etc while requiring less input effort time resources etc Fullers vision was that ephemeralization will result in everincreasing standards of living for an evergrowing population despite finite resources The concept has been embraced by those who argue against Malthusian philosophy Fuller uses Henry Fords assembly line as an example of how ephemeralization can continuously lead to better products at lower cost with no upper bound on productivity Fuller saw ephemeralization as an inevitable trend in human development The progression was from compression to tension to visual to abstract electrical ie nonsensorial radiation such as radio waves x rays etc Length measurement technologies in human development for example started with a compressive measure such as a ruler The compressive technique reached an upper limit with a rod For longer measures a tensive measure such as a string or rope was used This reached an upper limit with sagging of the string Next was a surveyorâ€™s telescope visual This reached an upper limit with curvature of the earth Next was radio triangulation abstract electrical The technological progression is a continuing increase in lengthmeasuring ability per pound of instrument with no apparent upper limit according to Fuller Consequences to society Francis Heylighen and Alvin Toffler have written that ephemeralization though it may increase our power to solve physical problems can make nonphysical problems worse According to Heylighen and Toffler increasing system complexity and information overload make it difficult and stressful for the people who must control the ephemeralized systems This can negate the advantages of ephemeralization The solution proposed by Heylighen is the integration of human intelligence computer intelligence and coordination mechanisms that direct an issue to the cognitive resource document person or computer program most fit to address it This requires a distributed selforganizing system formed by all individuals computers and the communication links that connect them The selforganization can be achieved by algorithms According to Heylighen the effect is to superpose the contributions of many different human and computer agents into a collective map that may link the cognitive and physical resources relatively efficiently The resulting information system could react relatively rapidly and adaptively to requests for guidance or changes in the situation In Heylighens view the system could frequently be fed with new information from its myriad human users and computer agents which it would take into account to offer the human users a list of the best possible approaches to achieve tasks Heylighen believes nearoptimization could be achieved both at the level of the individual who makes the request and at the level of society which attempts to minimize the conflicts between the desires of its different members and to aim at long term global progress while as much as possible protecting individual liberty and privacy See also Accelerating change Accidental complexity Attention economy Collective intelligence Global brain Intelligence amplification Miniaturization References Further reading Essay on ephemeralization worldtransorg An Essay by Paul Graham Quote The smartphone and tablet computer have effectively drilled a hole that will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas
