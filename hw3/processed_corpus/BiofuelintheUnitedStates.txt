 Main articles Biofuel and Renewable energy in the United States The United States produces mainly biodiesel and ethanol fuel which uses corn as the main feedstock In 2005 the US overtook Brazil as the worlds largest ethanol producer In 2006 the US produced 4855 billion US gallons 1838×10 m of ethanol The United States together with Brazil accounted for 70 percent of all ethanol production with total world production of 135 billion US gallons 51×10 m 40 million metric tons When accounting just for fuel ethanol production in 2007 the US and Brazil are responsible for 88 of the 131 billion US gallons 50×10 m total world production Biodiesel is commercially available in most oilseedproducing states As of 2005 it was somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities in comparison to petroleum products and ethanol fuel Due to increasing pollution control and climate change requirements and tax relief the US market is expected to grow to 1 to 2 billion US gallons 38×10 to 76×10 m by 2010 Biofuels are mainly used mixed with fossil fuels They are also used as additives The largest biodiesel consumer is the US Army Most light vehicles on the road today in the US can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends The demand for bioethanol fuel in the United States was stimulated by the discovery in the late 90s that methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE an oxygenate additive in gasoline was contaminating groundwater Cellulosic biofuels are under development to avoid upward pressure on food prices and land use changes that would be expected to result from a major increase in use of food biofuels Biofuels are not just limited to liquid fuels One of the often overlooked uses of biomass in the United States is in the gasification of biomass There is a small but growing number of people using woodgas to fuel cars and trucks all across America The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date Flexfuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability It should also be noted that the growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction operations and maintenance mostly in rural communities According to the Renewable Fuels Association the ethanol industry created almost 154000 US jobs in 2005 alone boosting household income by 57 billion It also contributed about 35 billion in tax revenues at the local state and federal levels On the other hand in 2010 the industry received 6646 billion in federal support not counting state and local support Based upon average US corn yields for the years 2007 through 2012 conversion of the entire US corn crop would yield 344 billion gallons of ethanol which is approximately 25 of 2012 finished motor fuel demand History The United States used biofuel in the beginning of the 20th century For example models of Ford T ran with ethanol fuel Then the interest in biofuels declined until the first and second oil crisis 1973 and 1979 The Department of Energy established the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 1974 and started to work in 1977 The NREL publish papers on biofuels Congress also voted the Energy Policy Act in 1994 and a newer in 2005 to promote renewable fuels Congress established regulars under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 intended to encourage the mixing of renewable fuels into our nations motor vehicle fuel supply Congress supported the renewable fuels program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to contain particular annual volume standards for complete renewable fuel and also for the fixed renewable fuel groups of biomassbased diesel biofuel and advanced biofuel The reassessed statutory requirements also incorporate new criteria for both renewable fuels and for the feedstocks used to produce them including lifecycle greenhouse gas emission thresholds Legislation Further information 2007 US Farm Bill Renewable Fuel Standard RFS1 Further information Lowcarbon fuel standard The current National Renewable Fuel Standard program RFS1 was established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which amended the Clean Air Act by establishing the first national renewable fuel standard The US Congress gave the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA the responsibility to coordinate with the US Department of Energy the US Department of Agriculture and stakeholders to design and implement this new program The Renewable Fuel Standard called for 75 billion US gallons 28×10 m of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 expanding the market for biofuels The EPA announced that the 2009 Renewable Fuel Standard will require most refiners importers and nonoxygenate blenders of gasoline to displace 1021 of their gasoline with renewable fuels such as ethanol That requirement aims to ensure that at least 111 billion US gallons 42×10 m of renewable fuels will be sold in 2009 in keeping with the targets established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 EISA While the RFS requirement is increasing by about 23—from 9 billion US gallons 34×10 m in 2008 to 111 billion US gallons 42×10 m in 2009—the percentage requirement is increasing by nearly one third from 776 in 2008 to 1021 in 2009 The EPA determines that fuel blenders are meeting renewable fuel requirements by examining Renewable Identification Numbers that they submit to the agency The 2009 RFS is also pushing up against what is known as the blend wall To address the blend wall issue DOE and others are studying the use of midrange blends such as E15 and E20 for use in standard gasolineburning vehicles Allowing all gasoline blends to contain up to 20 ethanol would double the potential market for ethanol Renewable Fuel Standard RFS2 In May 2009 the EPA released proposed revisions to the National Renewable Fuel Standard program These revisions addressed changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard program as required by EISA The revised statutory requirements establish new specific volume standards for cellulosic biofuel biomassbased diesel advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel that must be used in transportation fuel each year The revised statutory requirements also include new definitions and criteria for both renewable fuels and the feedstocks used to produce them including new greenhouse gas emission GHG thresholds for renewable fuels The regulatory requirements for RFS will apply to domestic and foreign producers and importers of renewable fuel Of these modifications several are significantly notable First the volume standard under RFS2 was increased beginning in 2008 from 54 to 90 billion US gallons 20000000 to 34000000 m Thereafter the required volume continues to increase under RFS2 eventually reaching 36 billion US gallons 140×10 m by 2022 Volume Standards Greenhouse gas reduction thresholds EISA established new renewable fuel categories and eligibility requirements including setting the first ever mandatory greenhouse gas reduction thresholds for the various categories of fuels For each renewable fuel pathway greenhouse gas emissions are evaluated over the full life cycle including production and transport of the feedstock land use change production distribution and blending of the renewable fuel and end use of the renewable fuel The GHG emissions are then compared to the life cycle emissions of 2005 petroleum baseline fuels base year established as 2005 by EISA displaced by the renewable fuel such as gasoline or diesel The life cycle GHG emissions performance reduction thresholds as established by EISA range from 20 to 60 percent reduction depending on the renewable fuel category Renewable fuels Ethanol fuel Main article Ethanol fuel in the United States The demand for ethanol fuel in the United States was stimulated by the discovery in the late 1990s that methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE an oxygenate additive in gasoline was contaminating groundwater Due to the risks of widespread and costly litigation and because MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states by 2006 the substitution of MTBE opened a new market for ethanol fuel This demand shift for ethanol as an oxygenate additive took place at a time when oil prices were already significantly rising This shift also contributed to an expansion in the use of gasohol E10 and to a sharp increase in the production and sale of E85 flex vehicles since 2002 Low ethanol blends See also Common ethanol fuel mixtures Most cars on the road today in the US can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol E10 and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends Though E10 is mandatory only in 10 states ethanol blends in the US are available in other states as optional or added on lower percentages as a substitute to MTBE used to oxygenate gasoline without any labeling making E blends present in twothirds of the US gas supply Flexfuel vehicles See also E85 in the United States and Flexiblefuel vehicle Ford DaimlerChrysler and GM are among the automobile companies that sell flexiblefuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 ethanol E85 By mid2008 there were approximately seven million E85compatible vehicles on US roads However a 2005 survey found that 68 of American flexfuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex This is due to the fact that the exterior of flex and nonflex vehicles look exactly the same there is no sale price difference between them the lack of consumers awareness about E85s and also the decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling so buyers can be aware they are getting an E85 vehicle Since 2006 many new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and GM is also using badging with the text FlexfuelE85 Ethanol to clearly mark the car as an E85 FFV A major restriction hampering sales of E85 flex vehicles or fuelling with E85 is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 to the public as by October 2008 there were only 1802 gasoline filling stations selling E85 to the public in the entire US with a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states led by Minnesota with 357 stations more than any other state followed by Illinois with 189 Wisconsin with 118 and Missouri with 112 Only seven states do not have E85 available to the public Alaska Hawaii Maine New Hampshire New Jersey Rhode Island and Vermont The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations at an estimated cost of USD 60000 for each dedicated ethanol tank Chrysler General Motors and Ford have each pledged to manufacture 50 percent of their entire vehicle line as flexible fuel in model year 2012 if enough fueling infrastructure develops Regarding energy policy Presidentelect Barack Obama pledged during his electoral campaign to significantly reduce oil consumption with measures that among others include mandating all new vehicles to have FFV capability by the end of 2013 Biodiesel Main article Biodiesel in the United States GreenHunter Energy Inc has begun commercial operations at its biodiesel refinery in Houston Texas that can produce 105 million US gallons per year 400×10 ma of biodiesel That production capacity makes it the largest biodiesel refinery in the United States barely beating out the 100 million US gallons per year 380×10 ma biodiesel refinery built by Imperium Renewables in Washington For comparison the total US production capacity for biodiesel reached 2240 million US gallons per year 85×10 ma in 2007 although poor market conditions held 2007 production to about 450 million US gallons 17×10 m according to the National Biodiesel Board NBB In 2006 Fuel Bio Opened the largest biodiesel manufacturing plant on the east coast of the United States in Elizabeth New Jersey Fuel Bios operation is capable of producing a name plate capacity of 50 million US gallons 190×10 m of biodiesel per year Methanol fuel Main article Methanol fuel Methanol was first produced from pyrolysis of wood resulting in its common English name of wood alcohol Presently methanol is usually produced using methane the chief constituent of natural gas as a raw material It may also be produced by pyrolysis of many organic materials or by Fischer Tropsch from synthetic gas so be called biomethanol Production of methanol from synthesis gas using BiomassToLiquid can offer methanol production from biomass at efficiencies up to 75 Widespread production by this route has a postulated potential see Olah reference above to offer methanol fuel at a low cost and with benefits to the environment These production methods however are not suitable for small scale production Successful test programs in Europe and the US mainly in California were conducted with methanol flexfuel vehicles known as M85 flexfuel vehicles Ford began development of a flexiblefuel vehicle in 1982 and between 1985 and 1992 705 experimental FFVs were built and delivered to California and Canada including the 16L Ford Escort the 30L Taurus and the 50L LTD Crown Victoria These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford In 1996 a new FFV Ford Taurus was developed with models fully capable of running on either methanol or ethanol blended with gasoline This ethanol version of the Taurus became the first commercial production of an E85 FFV The momentum of the FFV production programs at the American car companies continued although by the end of the 1990s the emphasis shifted to the E85 version as it is today Ethanol was preferred over methanol because there is a large support from the farming community and thanks to the governments incentive programs and cornbased ethanol subsidies In 2005 Californias Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger terminated the use of methanol after 25 years and 200 million miles of successful operation to join the expanding use of ethanol driven by producers of corn In spite of this he was optimistic about the future of the program claiming it will be back Ethanol is currently as of 2009 priced at 2 to 3 dollars per gallon while methanol made from natural gas remains at 47 cents per gallon Presently there are over 60 operating gas stations in California supplying methanol in their pumps Butanol fuel A team of chemical engineers at the University of Arkansas have developed a method for converting common algae into butanol which can be used as fuel in existing gasoline internal combustible engines The algae are grown on raceway troughs and the algaes growth is enhanced by delivering high concentrations of carbon dioxide through hollow fiber membranes Questions have been raised about the amount of energy needed to produce fuelgrade ethanol compared to the amount of energy it releases upon combustion Depending on who you ask you may get a different answer as to whether or not ethanol from corn produces more energy than it consumes Therefore companies like BP and DuPont have been looking at the next generation of biofuel specifically investigating butanol Specific advantages to using butanol compared to ethanol include higher energy content per kg the ability to be blended at higher concentrations without further adaptation of vehicles and potential to use existing storagetransport infrastructure However using corn as a feedstock to produce either ethanol or butanol seems infeasible without significant technology improvements regarding yields Currently about 25 US gallons 95 L of butanol can be produced per bushel of corn 373 lt Meanwhile about 275 US gallons 104 L of ethanol can be produced per bushel of corn 410 lt Our current production of ethanol is about 5 billion US gallons per year 19×10 ma but it requires 20 of the United States corn crop and only replaces 1 of its petroleum use Reaching the 36 billion US gallons 140×10 m biofuel mandate by 2022 would be a difficult task if only using a corn grain feedstock Renewable Natural Gas RNG Many cellulosic biomass materials produce methane naturally Methane is the main component of natural gas Naturally occurring methane is often considered a source of pollution from landfills dairy farms and human waste sources The EPA routinely issues rules to reduce the emission of methane from landfills and other sources Naturally occurring methane emissions typically called landfill gas or biogas are not clean enough to be introduced directly in the US National Natural Gas Pipeline system but technology to do so has been developed The pipeline quality gas is called Renewable Natural Gas RNG In July 2014 the EPA issued a ruling that RNG produced from landfills would qualify as D3 RIN qualifying fuel under RFS2 In one month’s time D3 RIN generation soared from the 4000 recorded for July to 349 million for August 2014 As can be seen by the 4000 D3 RIN credits issued in July 2014 industry had made little progress at developing an economically viable D3 fuel prior to the EPAs ruling that RNG from landfills would qualify as a D3 fuel D3 RIN generation has continued to increase and 2 years later in August 2016 it was 156 million EGE ethanol equivalent gallons In 2015 over 98 of D3 RIN credits issued were issued for RNG The American Biogas Council believes 179 billion diesel gallon equivalents of RNG can be produced each year from the existing US waste stream By state Louisiana Louisiana State University Agricultural Center researchers in the Louisiana Institute for Biofuels and Bioprocessing are studying the regular production of biomass for economically viable conversion to biofuels and bioenergy using existing refinery infrastructure This project called the LSU AgCenter Sustainable Bioproducts Initiative involves a team of university and industry partners who are studying how to use energy cane and sweet sorghum to help reinvigorate the Louisiana sugar and chemical industries The project will expand the United States’ southern regional agricultural sector by utilizing sweet sorghum and energy cane to produce butanol gasoline isoprene and byproduct chemicals Developers believe the project eventually will contribute significantly to improving rural prosperity and job creation in the southern region of the United States Michigan Michigan State University researcher Bruce Dale says that 30 of USAs energy can be achieved by 2030 The greenhouse emissions are reduced by 86 for cellulose compared to corns 29 reduction A plant is being built now in Georgia to make up to 100 million US gallons 380000 m per year Minnesota Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty signed a bill on May 12 2008 that will require all diesel fuel sold in the state for use in internal combustion engines to contain at least 20 biodiesel by May 1 2015 Oregon Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski signed legislation in July 2007 that will require all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10 bioethanol a blend known as BE10 and all diesel fuel sold in the state to be blended with 2 biodiesel a blend known as BD2 Oregon currently has the only biofuels station in the country that can be used by any type of vehicle United States Department of Energy projects The United States Department of Energy has announced that it has selected six universityled advanced biofuels projects to receive up to 44 million subject to annual appropriations The awardees—Georgia Tech Research Corporation the University of Georgia the University of Maine Montana State University Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and the University of Toledo in Ohio—will all receive funding to conduct research and development of costeffective environmentally friendly biomass conversion technologies for turning nonfood feedstocks into advanced biofuels Combined with a university cost share of 20 more than 57 million is slated for investment in these projects Most of the projects will involve microbiology including the University of Georgia and Montana State University projects which are both focused on producing oils from algae The University of Georgia will investigate the use of poultry litter to produce lowcost nutrients for algae while Montana State in partnership with Utah State University will research the oil content growth and oil production of algae cultures in open ponds Applying microbiology to biomass conversion the University of Maine will study the use of bacteria to create biofuels from regionally available feedstocks such as seaweed sludge and paper mill waste streams while the University of Toledo will attempt to use pellets containing enzymes to efficiently convert cellulosic biomass into ethanol In contrast Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Stevens Institute of Technology are both investigating the gasification of biomass Georgia Tech will evaluate two experimental gasifiers run on forest residues while Stevens Institute will test a novel microchannel reactor that gasifies pyrolysis oil a petroleumlike oil produced by exposing biomass sources such as wood chips to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen Gasified biomass can be used as a gaseous fuel or passed through a catalyst to produce a wide range of liquid fuels and chemicals Biofuel companies Unfortunately costs of producing ethanol from cellulosic feedstock such as wood chips are still about 70 higher than production from corn because of an extra step in the production process when compared to production of cornderived ethanol Until recently the idea of extracting ethanol from farm waste and other sources was barely clinging to life in the recesses of university campuses and federal labs because production problems as well as the need to bring together a vast team of specialists Consider Finding a bacterium from a cows intestinal tract or from elephant dung that has the correct enzyme to degrade cellulose and then bringing in geneticists to modify that enzyme kept this discouraging feat from ever growing beyond its embryonic state Now that is all changing with a race by approximately thirty companies attempting to accomplish this alchemical feat and in the process working directly or coordinating with environmental groups biotechnology firms some major oil companies chemical giants auto makers defense hawks and venture capitalists The winner will be whoever can make cellulosic ethanol in mass quantities for as little money per gallon as possible With the majority of such biofuel companies Iogen Corporation SunOptas BioProcess Group Genencor Novozymes Dyadic International Inc DYAI Kansas Citybased Alternative Energy Sources Inc NasdaqAENS Flex Fuels USA based in Huntsville Alabama now owned by Alternative Energy Sources or BRI Energy LLC Abengoa Bioenergy located in North America the United States is in a unique position to lead the way in the development production and sale of a new source of energy One notable company that deserves special mention is ArcherDanielsMidland Company ADM which has already invested heavily into building approximately 100 cornethanol production plants known as biorefineries and churns out about onefifth of the countrys ethanol supply This occurred due to seasonal overcapacity in its corn syrup plants when surplus was available to produce ethanol Moreover ADM is in a unique position to utilize unused parts of the corn crop and convert previously discarded waste into a viable product The hull surrounding corn contains fiber that the Decatur Illinois grainprocessing giants ethanolmaking microorganisms can not use Figuring out how to convert the fiber into more sugar could increase the output of an existing cornethanol plant by 15 Consequently ADM wouldnt have to figure out how to collect a new source of biomass but merely use the existing infrastructure for gathering corn—resulting in an advantage over its competitors ADM executives want government help to build a plant that could cost between 50 million and 100 million Prescient in their position in the quest for success ADM recently hired the head of petroleum refining at Chevron Patricia A Woertz to metamorphasize ADM into the ExxonMobil of the ethanol industry If ADM succeeds it will catapult beyond the ethanol industry to compete with the larger global energy industry In essence the old paradigm of processing a barrel of crude oil into gasoline will be replaced with processing a bushel of corn into ethanol Meanwhile DuPont the chemical giant is attempting to figure out how to construct a biorefinery fueled by corn stover—the stalk and leaves that are left in the field after farmers harvest their crop The companys goal is to make ethanol from cellulose as cheaply as from corn kernels by 2009 If it works the technology could double the amount of ethanol produced by a field of corn Diversa Corporation a biotech company based in San Diego examined how biomass is converted into energy in the natural environment They have found that the enzymes inherent in the bacteria and protozoa that inhabit the digestive tracts of the household termite efficiently convert 95 of cellulose into fermentable sugars Using proprietary DNA extraction and cloning technologies they were able to isolate the cellulosedegrading enzymes By reenacting this natural process the company created a cocktail of highperformance enzymes for industrial ethanol production enablers Although still in the early stages of this work the initial results are promising Currently these expensive enzymes cost about 25 cents per gallon of ethanol although this price is very likely to decline by half in the coming years Construction of the first US commercial plant producing cellulosic ethanol will commence in the State of Iowa in February 2007 The Voyager Ethanol plant in Emmetsburg owned by POET LLC will be converted from a 50millionUSgallonperyear 190×10 ma conventional corn dry mill facility into a 125millionUSgallonperyear 470×10 ma commercialscale biorefinery producing ethanol from not only corn but also the stalk leaves and cobs of the corn plant Most ethanol plants rely on natural gas to power their processing equipment The process to be used at the Emmetsburg plant will enable the plant to make 11 more ethanol by weight of corn and 27 more by area of corn The process cuts the need for fossil fuel power at the plant by 83 by using some of its own byproduct for power The 200 million plant is scheduled to begin in February and take about 30 months to complete Project completion is contingent upon partial funding from a USDOE grant which is likely as the US Government views the renewable energy project as a fullblown national security issue Green Plains Renewable Energy claims to be the fourth largest ethanol fuel producer in North America as of February 2012 See also Biobutanol Biorefinery
