puɾtuɣezɐ is a country on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe To the west and south it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east and north by Spain The Portugal–Spain border is 1214 kilometres 754 miles long and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira both autonomous regions with their own regional governments The territory of modern Portugal has been continuously settled invaded and fought over since prehistoric times The PreCelts Celts Carthaginians and the Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples In 711 the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by the Moors making Portugal part of Muslim Al Andalus Portugal was born as result of the Christian Reconquista and in 1139 Afonso Henriques was proclaimed King of Portugal thus firmly establishing Portuguese independence In the 15th and 16th centuries Portugal established the first global empire becoming one of the worlds major economic political and military powers During this time Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration in the Age of Discovery notably under royal patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator and King João II with such notable discoveries as Bartolomeu Diass reach of the Cape of Good Hope 1488 the Vasco da Gamas sea route to India 1497–98 and the discovery of Brazil 1500 Portugal monopolized the spice trade during this time and the Portuguese Empire expanded with military campaigns led in Asia But the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake the countrys occupation during the Napoleonic Wars the independence of Brazil 1822 and the Liberal Wars 1828–34 all left Portugal crippled from war and diminished in its world power After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established later being superseded by the Estado Novo rightwing authoritarian regime Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974 Shortly after independence was granted to almost all its overseas territories marking the end of the longestlived colonial empire Portugal has left a profound cultural and architectural influence across the globe and a legacy of over 250 million Portuguese speakers today Portugal is a developed country with a highincome advanced economy and a high living standard It is the 5th most peaceful country in the world maintaining a unitary semipresidential republican form of government It has the 18th highest Social Progress in the world putting it ahead of other Western European countries like France Spain and Italy A founding member of NATO and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries it is also a member of numerous other international organizations including the United Nations the European Union the eurozone and OECD Portugal is a pioneer when it comes to drug decriminalization as the nation decriminalized the possession of all drugs for personal use in 2001 Moreover after years of investment and cooperation Portugal marked a climax on renewable energy worldwide in 2016 when it was powered for 107 consecutive hours exclusively by wind sun and water which advocates say further shows fossil fuels are indeed replaceable History Main article History of Portugal Early history PreCelts and Celts Main articles Lusitania and Kingdom of the Suebi The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in South Western Europe The name of Portugal derives from the joined RomanoCeltic name Portus Cale The region was settled by PreCelts and Celts giving origin to peoples like the Gallaeci Lusitanians Celtici and Cynetes visited by Phoenicians and Carthaginians incorporated in the Roman Republic dominions as Lusitania and part of Gallaecia after 45 BC until 298 AD settled again by Suebi Buri and Visigoths and conquered by Moors Other influences include some 5thcentury vestiges of Alan settlements which were found in Alenquer old Germanic Alankerk from Alankerk meaning temple of the Alans Coimbra and Lisbon The region of presentday Portugal was inhabited by Neanderthals and then by Homo sapiens who roamed the borderless region of the northern Iberian peninsula These were subsistence societies that although they did not establish prosperous settlements did establish organized societies Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals the raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing It is believed by some scholars that early in the first millennium BC several waves of Celts invaded Portugal from Central Europe and intermarried with the local populations forming different ethnic groups with many tribes Chief among these tribes were the Calaicians or Gallaeci of Northern Portugal the Lusitanians of central Portugal the Celtici of Alentejo and the Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve Among the lesser tribes or subdivisions were the Bracari Coelerni Equaesi Grovii Interamici Leuni Luanqui Limici Narbasi Nemetati Paesuri Quaquerni Seurbi Tamagani Tapoli Turduli Turduli Veteres Turdulorum Oppida Turodi and Zoelae A few small semipermanent commercial coastal settlements such as Tavira were also founded in the Algarve region by PhoeniciansCarthaginians Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia Main articles Lusitania Gallaecia and Hispania Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC During the last days of Julius Caesar almost the entire peninsula had been annexed to the Roman Republic The Carthaginians Romes adversary in the Punic Wars were expelled from their coastal colonies The Roman conquest of what is now part of modernday Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and the lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slavery mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire It suffered a severe setback in 150 BC when a rebellion began in the north The Lusitanians and other native tribes under the leadership of Viriathus wrested control of all of western Iberia Rome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion but to no avail—the Lusitanians kept conquering territory The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy They bribed Viriathuss allies to kill him In 139 BC Viriathus was assassinated and Tautalus became leader Rome installed a colonial regime The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the Visigothic era In 27 BC Lusitania gained the status of Roman province Later a northern province of Lusitania was formed known as Gallaecia with capital in Bracara Augusta todays Braga There are still many ruins of castros hill forts all over modern Portugal and remains of Castro culture Numerous Roman sites are scattered around presentday Portugal some urban remains are quite large like Conímbriga and Mirobriga The former beyond being one of the largest Roman settlements in Portugal is also classified as a National Monument Conímbriga lies 16 kilometres 99 miles from Coimbra which by its turn was the ancient Aeminium The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations Several works of engineering such as baths temples bridges roads circus theatres and laymans homes are preserved throughout the country Coins some of which coined in Lusitanian land as well as numerous pieces of ceramics were also found Contemporary historians include Paulus Orosius c 375–418 and Hydatius c 400–469 bishop of Aquae Flaviae who reported on the final years of the Roman rule and arrival of the Germanic tribes Germanic kingdoms Suebi and Visigoths In the early 5th century Germanic tribes namely the Suebi and the Vandals Silingi and Hasdingi together with their allies the Sarmatians and Alans invaded the Iberian Peninsula where they would form their kingdom The Kingdom of the Suebi was the Germanic postRoman kingdom established in the former Roman provinces of GallaeciaLusitania About 410 and during the 6th century it became a formally declared kingdom where king Hermeric made a peace treaty with the Gallaecians before passing his domains to Rechila his son In 448 Réchila died leaving the state in expansion to Rechiar In the year 500 the Visigothic Kingdom was installed in Iberia centred on Toledo The Visigoths eventually conquered the Suebi and its capital city Bracara modern day Portugals Braga in 584–585 following the consecutive defeats of the two last Suebi kings Audeca and Malaric The former Kingdom of the Suebi then became the sixth province of the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania For the next 300 years and by the year 700 the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths This period lasted until 711 when King Roderic Rodrigo was killed while opposing a Moorish invasion from the south From the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia the Suebi left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal Galicia and Asturias Islamic period and the Reconquista Todays modern day continental Portugal along with most of modern Spain was part of the Umayyad Caliphate between 711 AD – 1249 AD following the Umayyad Caliphate conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 AD This occupation lasted from some decades in the North to approximately five centuries in the South After defeating the Visigoths in only a few months the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula Beginning in 711 the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphates empire of Damascus which stretched from the Indus river in the Indian subcontinent now Pakistan up to the South of France until its collapse in 750 That year the west of the empire gained its independence under AbdarRahman I with the establishment of the Emirate of Córdoba After almost two centuries the Emirate became the Caliphate of Córdoba in 929 until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms called Taifa kingdoms The governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves Emir of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north Most of Portugal fell into the hands of the Taifa of Badajoz of the Aftasid Dynasty and after a short spell of an ephemeral Taifa of Lisbon in 1022 fell under the dominion of the Taifa of Seville of the Abbadids poets The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the Almoravids who came from Morocco in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Sagrajas followed a century later in 1147 after the second period of Taifa by the Almohads also from Marrakesh AlAndalus was divided into different districts called Kura Gharb AlAndalus at its largest was constituted of ten kuras each with a distinct capital and governor The main cities of the period in Portugal were Beja Silves Alcácer do Sal Santarém and Lisbon The Muslim population of the region consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam the socalled Muwallad or Muladi and berbers The Arabs were principally noblemen from Syria and Oman and though few in numbers they constituted the elite of the population The Berbers were originally from the Atlas mountains and Rif mountains of North Africa and were essentially nomads County of Portucale Main article County of Portugal An Asturian Visigothic noble named Pelagius of Asturias in 718 AD was elected leader by many of the ousted Visigoth nobles Pelagius called for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands better known today as the Cantabrian Mountains in what is today the small mountain region in Northwestern Spain adjacent to the Bay of Biscay Pelagius plan was to use the Cantabrian mountains as a place of refuge and protection from the invading Moors He then aimed to regroup the Iberian Peninsulas Christian armies and use the Cantabrian mountains as a springboard from which to regain their lands In the process after defeating the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722 AD Pelagius was proclaimed king thus founding the Christian Kingdom of Asturias and starting the war of Christian reconquest known in Portuguese as the Reconquista Cristã At the end of the 9th century the region of Portugal between the rivers Minho and Douro was freed or reconquered from the Moors by Vímara Peres on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias Finding that the region had previously had two major cities—Portus Cale in the coast and Braga in the interior with many towns that were now deserted—he decided to repopulate and rebuild them with Portuguese and Galician refugees and other Christians Vímara Peres organized the region he freed from the Moors and elevated it to the status of County naming it the County of Portugal after the regions major port city—Portus Cale or modern Porto One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes known today as Guimarães – the birthplace of the Portuguese nation or the cradle city Cidade Berço in Portuguese After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias King Alfonso III of Asturias knighted Vímara Peres in 868 AD as the First Count of Portus Cale Portugal The region became known as Portucale Portugale and simultaneously Portugália — the County of Portugal Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring With the forced abdication of Alfonso III the Great of Asturias by his sons in 910 the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms of León Galicia and Asturias The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 León and Galicia in 914 Asturias later under the crown of León During the century of internecine struggles for dominance among the Northern Christians kingdoms the County of Portugal formed the southern portion of the Kingdom of Galicia At times the Kingdom of Galicia existed independently for short periods but usually formed an important part of the Kingdom of León Throughout this period the people of County of Portugal as Galicians found themselves struggling to maintain the autonomy of Galicia with its distinct language and culture GalicianPortuguese from the Leonese culture whenever the status of the Kingdom of Galicia changed in relation to the Kingdom of León As a result of political division GalicianPortuguese lost its unity when the County of Portugal separated from the Kingdom of Galicia a dependent kingdom of León to establish the Kingdom of Portugal In 1093 Alfonso VI of León and Castile bestowed the county to Henry of Burgundy and married him to his daughter Teresa of León for his role in reconquering the land from Moors Henry based his newly formed county in Bracara Augusta modern Braga capital city of the ancient Roman province and also previous capital of several kingdoms over the first millennia Independence and Afonsine era Main articles Portugal in the Middle Ages and Portuguese House of Burgundy On 24 June 1128 the Battle of São Mamede occurred near Guimarães Afonso Henriques Count of Portugal defeated his mother Countess Teresa and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava thereby establishing himself as sole leader Afonso then turned his arms against the Moors in the south Afonsos campaigns were successful and on 25 July 1139 he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal as a fief of the Kingdom of León was transformed into the independent Kingdom of Portugal Afonso then established the first of the Portuguese Cortes at Lamego where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the Portuguese Restoration War Afonso was recognized in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of León and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III During the Reconquista period Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Moorish domination Afonso Henriques and his successors aided by military monastic orders pushed southward to drive out the Moors At this time Portugal covered about half of its present area In 1249 the Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast giving Portugal its presentday borders with minor exceptions In one of these situations of conflict with the kingdom of Castile Dinis I of Portugal signed with the king Fernando IV of Castile which was represented when being a minor by his mother the queen Maria de Molina the Treaty of Alcañices 1297 which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant Juan de Castilla This treaty established inter alia the border demarcation between the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of Leon where the disputed town of Olivenza was included The reigns of Dinis I Denis I Afonso IV Alphons IV and Pedro I Peter I for the most part saw peace with the Christian kingdoms of Iberia In 1348 and 1349 Portugal like the rest of Europe was devastated by the Black Death In 1373 Portugal made an alliance with England which is the longeststanding alliance in the world Over time this went way beyond geopolitical and military cooperation protecting both nations interests in Africa the Americas and Asia against French Spanish and Dutch rivals and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies Particularly in the Oporto region there is visible English influence to this day Joanine era and Age of Discoveries Main articles History of Portugal 1415–1578 Portuguese discoveries and House of Aviz In 1383 John I of Castile husband of Beatrice of Portugal and soninlaw of Ferdinand I of Portugal claimed the throne of Portugal A faction of petty noblemen and commoners led by John of Aviz later King John I of Portugal and commanded by General Nuno Álvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota With this battle the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal Portugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery Prince Henry the Navigator son of King João I became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour During this period Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean discovering several Atlantic archipelagos like the Azores Madeira and Cape Verde explored the African coast colonized selected areas of Africa discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope discovered Brazil explored the Indian Ocean established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan In 1415 Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic Madeira and the Azores which led to the first colonization movements Throughout the 15th century Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time ranging from gold to slaves as they looked for a route to India and its spices which were coveted in Europe The Treaty of Tordesillas intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus which was made by Pope Alexander VI the mediator between Portugal and Spain It was signed on 7 June 1494 and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands off the west coast of Africa In 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 17 million residents helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance In 1500 the Portuguese explorer Gaspar CorteReal reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal CoveSt Philips Newfoundland and Labrador long before the French and English in the 17th century and being just one of many Portuguese Colonizations of the Americas In 1500 Pedro Álvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal Ten years later Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait and Malacca now a state in Malaysia Thus the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe landing in such places as Taiwan Japan the island of Timor and in the Moluccas Although for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521 The Treaty of Zaragoza signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain specified the antimeridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas All these factors made Portugal one of the worlds major economic military and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century Iberian Union Restoration and early Brigantine era Main articles Iberian Union Portuguese Restoration War and House of Braganza Portugals sovereignty was interrupted between 1580 and 1640 This occurred because the last two kings of the House of Aviz – King Sebastian who died in the battle of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco and his greatuncle and successor King Henry of Portugal – both died without heirs resulting in the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 Subsequently Philip II of Spain claimed the throne and so became Philip I of Portugal Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence it was governed by the same monarch who governed the Spanish Empire briefly forming a union of kingdoms At this time Spain was a geographic territory The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of an independent foreign policy and led to its involvement in the Eighty Years War between Spain and the Netherlands War led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugals oldest ally England and the loss of Hormuz a strategic trading post located between Iran and Oman From 1595 to 1663 the DutchPortuguese War primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese colonies and commercial interests in Brazil Africa India and the Far East resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian sea trade monopoly In 1640 John IV spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king The Portuguese Restoration War between Portugal and the Spanish Empire in the aftermath of the 1640 revolt ended the sixtyyear period of the Iberian Union under the House of Habsburg This was the beginning of the House of Braganza which reigned in Portugal until 1910 King John IVs eldest son came to reign as Afonso VI however his physical and mental disabilities left him overpowered by Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor In a palace coup organized by the Kings wife Maria Francisca of Savoy and his brother Pedro Duke of Beja King Afonso VI was declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores and then to the Royal Palace of Sintra outside Lisbon After Afonsos death Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II Pedros reign saw the consolidation of national independence imperial expansion and investment in domestic production Pedro IIs son John V saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury supplied largely by the royal fifth a tax on precious metals that was received from the Portuguese colonies of Brazil and Maranhão Acting as an absolute monarch John nearly depleted his countrys tax revenues on ambitious architectural works most notably Mafra Palace and on commissions and additions for his sizable art and literary collections Official estimates – and most estimates made so far – place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600000 This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies in the Americas during colonial times Pombaline era and Enlightenment Main article History of Portugal 1640–1777 In 1738 Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo 1st Marquis of Pombal began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London and later in Vienna The Queen consort of Portugal Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria was fond of Melo and after his first wife died she arranged the widowed de Melos second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal Leopold Josef Count von Daun King John V of Portugal however was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749 John V died the following year and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned In contrast to his father Joseph I was fond of de Melo and with the Queen Mothers approval he appointed Melo as Minister of Foreign Affairs As the Kings confidence in de Melo increased the King entrusted him with more control of the state By 1755 Sebastião de Melo was made Prime Minister Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from the Ambassador he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India reorganized the army and the navy restructured the University of Coimbra and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal But Sebastião de Melos greatest reforms were economic and financial with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity He demarcated the region for production of Port to ensure the wines quality and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class along with a widespread review of the countrys tax system These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes especially among the high nobility who despised him as a social upstart Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755 when Lisbon was struck by a violent earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude of 85–9 The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires Sebastião de Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city with his famous quote What now We bury the dead and take care of the living Despite the calamity and huge death toll Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes Architectural models were built for tests and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbons tourist attractions Sebastião de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country Following the earthquake Joseph I gave his Prime Minister even more power and Sebastião de Melo became a powerful progressive dictator As his power grew his enemies increased in number and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination The Távora family and the Duke of Aveiro were implicated and executed after a quick trial The Jesuits were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown Sebastião de Melo prosecuted every person involved even women and children This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of Oeiras in 1759 In 1762 Spain invaded Portuguese territory as part of the Seven Years War but by 1763 the status quo between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored Following the Távora affair the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition Made Marquis of Pombal in 1770 he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph Is death in 1779 However historians also argue that Pombal’s enlightenment while farreaching was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition suppressing criticism and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit Napoleonic era Main articles History of Portugal 1777–1834 and United Kingdom of Portugal Brazil and the Algarves The new ruler Queen Maria I of Portugal disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the Távora family and upon her accession to the throne she withdrew all his political offices Pombal died on his estate at Pombal in 1782 In the autumn of 1807 Napoleon moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal From 1807 to 1811 BritishPortuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal while the royal family and the Portuguese nobility including Maria I relocated to the Portuguese territory of Brazil at that time a colony of the Portuguese Empire in South America This episode is known as the Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil With the occupation by Napoleon Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the countrys largest colonial possession Brazil In 1807 as Napoleons army closed in on Lisbon the Prince Regent João VI of Portugal transferred his court to Brazil and established Rio de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire In 1815 Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it forming a pluricontinental State the United Kingdom of Portugal Brazil and the Algarves As a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family Brazilian administrative civic economical military educational and scientific apparatus were expanded and highly modernized Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the French Invasion of Portugal and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that João VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon However the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820 which started in Porto demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821 Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status his son Pedro with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites declared Brazils independence from Portugal Cisplatina todays sovereign state of Uruguay in the south was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule Brazilian independence was recognized in 1825 whereby Emperor Pedro I granted unto his father the titular honour of Emperor of Brazil John VIs death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession Though Pedro was his heir and reigned briefly as Pedro IV his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter Maria II However Pedros brother Infante Miguel claimed the throne in protest After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed Miguel seized power as King Miguel I in 1828 In order to defend his daughters rights to the throne Pedro launched the Liberal Wars to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal The war ended in 1834 with Miguels defeat the promulgation of a constitution and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II Constitutional monarchy Main article History of Portugal 1834–1910 Queen Maria II and King Ferdinand IIs son King Pedro V modernized the country during his short reign 1853–1861 Under his reign roads telegraphs and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced His popularity increased when during the cholera outbreak of 1853–1856 he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick Pedros reign was short as he died of cholera in 1861 after a series of deaths in the royal family including his two brothers Infante Fernando and Infante João Duke of Beja and his wife Stephanie of HohenzollernSigmaringen Not having children his brother Luís I of Portugal ascended the throne and continued his modernization At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia Luanda Benguela Bissau Lourenço Marques Porto Amboim and the Island of Mozambique were among the oldest Portuguesefounded port cities in its African territories During this phase Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nationsized territories to compete with other European powers there With the Conference of Berlin of 1884 Portuguese Africa territories had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centurieslong Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the Scramble for Africa Portuguese Africas cities and towns like Nova Lisboa Sá da Bandeira Silva Porto Malanje Tete Vila Junqueiro Vila Pery and Vila Cabral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond New coastal towns like Beira Moçâmedes Lobito João Belo Nacala and Porto Amélia were also founded Even before the turn of the 20th century railway tracks as the Benguela railway in Angola and the Beira railway in Mozambique started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the 1890 British Ultimatum This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola most of presentday Zimbabwe and Zambia which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its Pink Map which clashed with British aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway The Portuguese territories in Africa were Cape Verde São Tomé and Príncipe Portuguese Guinea Angola and Mozambique The tiny fortress of São João Baptista de Ajudá on the coast of Dahomey was also under Portuguese rule In addition Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of Portuguese India Portuguese Timor and Macau On 1 February 1908 the king Dom Carlos I of Portugal and his heir apparent Prince Royal Dom Luís Filipe Duke of Braganza were murdered in Lisbon Under his rule Portugal had twice been declared bankrupt – on 14 June 1892 and again on 10 May 1902 – causing social turmoil economic disturbances protests revolts and criticism of the monarchy Manuel II of Portugal became the new king but was eventually overthrown by the 5 October 1910 revolution which abolished the regime and instated republicanism in Portugal First Republic and Estado Novo Main articles Portuguese First Republic and Estado Novo Portugal Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the Portuguese First Republic These conditions would lead to the failed Monarchy of the North 28 May 1926 coup détat and the creation of the National Dictatorship Ditadura Nacional This in turn led to the establishment of the rightwing dictatorship of the Estado Novo under António de Oliveira Salazar in 1933 Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in World War II From the 1940s to the 1960s Portugal was a founding member of NATO OECD and the European Free Trade Association EFTA Gradually new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated with Angola and Mozambique as the largest and richest overseas territories being the main targets of those initiatives These actions were used to affirm Portugals status as a transcontinental nation and not as a colonial empire After India attained independence in 1947 proIndian residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the support of the Indian government and the help of proindependence organisations separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954 In 1961 São João Baptista de Ajudás annexation by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuriesold Portuguese Empire According to the census of 1921 São João Baptista de Ajudá had 5 inhabitants and at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of Goa Daman and Diu As a result the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces The operations resulted in the defeat and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories which continued to be represented in Portugals National Assembly until the military coup of 1974 Also in the early 1960s independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of Angola Mozambique and Guinea in Africa resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War 1961–1974 Throughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community However the authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime first installed and governed by António de Oliveira Salazar and from 1968 onwards led by Marcelo Caetano tried to preserve a vast centurieslong intercontinental empire with a total area of 2168071 km Carnation Revolution and European integration Main articles Carnation Revolution and Portuguese transition to democracy The Portuguese government and army resisted the decolonization of its overseas territories until April 1974 when a bloodless leftwing military coup in Lisbon known as the Carnation Revolution led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC Processo Revolucionário Em Curso This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left and rightwing political forces The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations which would create independent states in 1975 prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugals African territories mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique Over one million Portuguese refugees fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia Mário Soares and António de Almeida Santos were charged with organising the independence of Portugals overseas territories By 1975 all the Portuguese African

Iberian Peninsula referred to as the continent by most Portuguese and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores It lies between latitudes 32° and 43° N and longitudes 32° and 6° W Mainland Portugal is split by its main river the Tagus that flows from Spain and disgorges in Tagus Estuary in Lisbon before escaping into the Atlantic The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys whereas the south that includes the Algarve and the Alentejo regions is characterized by rolling plains Portugals highest peak is the similarly named Mount Pico on the island of Pico in the Azores This ancient volcano which measures 2351 m 7713 ft is an iconic symbol of the Azores while the Serra da Estrela on the mainland the summit being 1991 m 6532 ft above sea level is an important seasonal attraction for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean the Azores straddling the MidAtlantic Ridge on a tectonic triple junction and Madeira along a range formed by inplate hotspot geology Geologically these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events The last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957–58 Capelinhos and minor earthquakes occur sporadically usually of low intensity Portugals exclusive economic zone a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources has 1727408 km This is the 3rd largest exclusive economic zone of the European Union and the

Portugal The Algarve separated from the Alentejo region by mountains reaching up to 900 metres 3000 ft in Alto de Fóia has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over 3200 mm 1260 in in the northern mountains to less than 300 mm 118 in in the area of the Massueime River near Côa along the Douro

Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate although variations between islands exist making weather predictions very difficult owing to rough topography The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range with annual average temperatures exceeding 20 °C 68 °F along the coast according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer Consequently the island of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean climate both Csa and Csb types while some islands such as Flores or Corvo are classified as Maritime Temperate Cfb and Humid subtropical Cfa respectively according to KöppenGeiger classification Porto Santo island in Madeira has a semiarid steppe climate BSh The Savage Islands which are part of the

migratory birds in places such as Cape St Vincent or the Monchique mountains where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring return migration Most of the avian species congregate along the Iberian Peninsula since it is the closest stopover between Northern Europe and Africa Six hundred bird species occur in Portugal either for nesting or during the course of migration and annually there are new registries of nesting species The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American European and African birds while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species There are more than 100 freshwater fish species varying from the giant European catfish in the Tagus International Natural Park to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes along the western portion of country for example Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss pollution and drought Upwelling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world Marine fish species are more common and include thousands of species such as the sardine Sardina pilchardus tuna and Atlantic mackerel Bioluminescent species are also well represented including species in different colour spectrum and forms like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe in some beaches There are many endemic insect species most only found in certain parts of Portugal while other species are more widespread like the stag beetle Lucanus cervus and the cicada The Macaronesian islands Azores and Madeira have many endemic species like birds reptiles bats insects snails and

considerable resources of wind and river power the two most costeffective renewable sources Since the turn of the 21st century there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuel resources In 2006 the worlds largest solar power plant at that date the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station began operating near Moura in the south while the worlds first commercial wave power farm the Aguçadoura Wave Farm opened in the Norte region 2008 By the end of 2006 66 of the countrys electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants while 29 were derived from hydroelectric dams and 6 by wind energy In 2008 renewable energy resources were producing 43 of the nations consumption of electricity even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe droughts As of June 2010 electricity exports had outnumbered imports In the period between January and May 2010 70 of the national production of energy came from renewable sources Portugal’s national energy transmission company Redes Energéticas Nacionais REN uses sophisticated modeling to predict weather especially wind patterns and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewableenergy plants Before the solarwind revolution Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades New programs combine wind and water winddriven turbines pump water uphill at night the most blustery period then the water flows downhill by day generating electricity when consumer demand is highest Portugal’s distribution system is also now a twoway street Instead of just delivering electricity it draws electricity from even the smallest generators like rooftop solar panels The government aggressively encouraged such

years ago All subsequent migrations did leave an impact genetically and culturally but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations The total fertility rate TFR as of 2015 was estimated at 152 children bornwoman which is below the replacement rate of 21 In 2015 507 of

informed about their health status the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examinationbased data show about levels of illness within populations Thus survey results based on selfreporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal Kasmel et al 2004 This is the lowest of the EurA countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity Culture Main article Culture of Portugal Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various
