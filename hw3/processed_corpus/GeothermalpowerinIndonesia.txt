 Geothermal power in Indonesia is an increasingly significant source of Renewable Energy As a result of its volcanic geology it is often reported that Indonesia has 40 of the worlds potential geothermal resources estimated at 28000 megawatts MW Currently Indonesia is the worlds third largest geothermal electricity producer after the United States and the Philippines Installed production capacity 2011 is almost 1200 MW from six geothermal fields in Java North Sumatra and North Sulawesi In 2007 geothermal energy represented 19 of the countrys total energy supply and 37 of its electric power At the 2010 World Geothermal Congress in Bali President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono announced a plan to build 44 new geothermal plants by 2014 more than tripling capacity to 4000 MW By 2025 Indonesia aims to produce more than 9000 MW of geothermal power becoming the worlds leading geothermal energy producer This would account for 5 of Indonesias total energy needs A detailed report on the geothermal sector in Indonesia issued in 2015 by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank Unlocking Indonesias Geothermal Potential indicated that reforms in key areas of policy were likely to be needed to stimulate sustained expansion in the sector History The first proposal on energy from volcanoes came in 1918 during the Dutch colonial era In 1926 five test borings were drilled in Javas Kawah Kamojang field the third being the first that was successful In the early 1980s it was still discharging superheated steam from a depth of 66 metres at a temperature of 140 °C and a pressure of 35 to 4 bars A prefeasibility study for electricity generation was initiated in 1972 by Geothermal Energy New Zealand The first generator was inaugurated in 1983 by President Suharto and subsequently expanded in 1987 Current capacity is 140 MW Since the mid1980s Chevron the worlds largest geothermal power producer has operated two geothermal fields in West Java at Salak and Darajat with a combined capacity of around 365 MW Between 1989 and 1997 explorations were conducted at the Sibayak geothermal field in northern Sumatra and subsequently a 12 MW plant has been placed in operation In 1991 the Indonesia Geothermal Association Asosiasi Panasbumi Indonesia API a nongovernmental organisation was established to promote geothermal energy It has approximately 500 members including geothermal experts companies and stakeholders The Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station in West Java owned by British Star Energy has been in operation since 2000 It currently comprises two units with a total capacity of 227 MW There are plans for a third unit of 127 MW which is expected to be onstream by mid2013 Exploration and development Exploration of the Bedugul Geothermal Field in Bali started in 1974 and though production capacity was estimated at 175 MW in 2008 the project is on hold after being opposed by local residents At the 2010 World Geothermal Congress in Bali several companies were awarded the rights to develop geothermal fields and power plants Golden Spike Indonesia won the tender to develop a power plant at Mount Ungaran in Central Java Sokoria Geothermal Indonesia gained rights to develop a plant at Ende on Flores island while Supreme Energy was chosen to develop plants at Mount Rajabasa in Lampung and Solok in West Sumatra These projects were estimated to require a total investment of US168 billion As of 2010 a total of 265 potential sites for plants have been identified across the country Development of the industry however involves a range of complex policy issues some of which are proving to be a continuing source of controversy In mid2011 for example the Indonesian Government issued an expected regulation providing certain guarantees for investors with the aim of encouraging increased investment in the geothermal sector However investor response was guarded suggesting that key aspects had not been addressed in the regulation In late 2013 PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy PGE a geothermal business branch of state oil and gas company PT Pertamina—said that it planned to develop eight new geothermal plants with a total capacity of 655 MW expected to require 20 bn of new investments These included Of these several were to be financed with loans from World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency In addition work is starting on the Sarulla geothermal plant in North Sumatra with a total planned capacity of 320 MW The plant has been on the books since the early 1990s but development was stalled over various issues The plant expected to cost around 165 billion will be built with financial support from the Asian Development Bank along with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and other lenders Installed capacity According to the Renewable Energy Policy Networks Renewables 2013 Global Status Report Indonesia has the third largest installed generating capacity in the world in the geothermal sector With 13 GW installed capacity Indonesia trails only the United States 34 GW and the Philippines 19 GW However it leads Mexico 10 GW Italy 09 GW New Zealand 08 GW Iceland 07 GW and Japan 05 GW Recent developments In recent years the Indonesian Government has announced plans for two fasttrack increases in the total capacity of Indonesias electricity generation network of 10000 MW each Under the second 10000 MW fasttrack plan it was forecast that a relatively large share of 3970 MW would be installed in geothermal plants But under the first 10000 MW fasttrack plan investment in the geothermal sector appears to be lagging September 2011 The Indonesian stateowned electricity utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara PLN announced that the outlook was that by 2014 only 1200 MW of power was likely to be produced from geothermal plants The thenpresident director of the PLN Dahlan Iskan said that plans to develop a number of geothermal plants were behind schedule because private sector investors were reluctant to invest as a result of the perceived risks in the sector July 2012 A senior official from the PLN reported that there were 13 geothermal power plants that were still stuck in the exploration stages and were likely to miss development deadlines Problems mentioned included disappointing results at drilling sites lack of adequate supporting infrastructure mainly roads and difficulties that firms faced in obtaining required permits for their activities from the forestry department and local governments June 2013 The first International Geothermal Conference and Exhibition was held in Indonesia The relatively slow development of the sector attracted comment The Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources announced that the prices to be paid for energy supplied by geothermal suppliers would be increased to encourage activity in the sector Speaking at the conference the Indonesian Vice President Boediono called for changes in policy to speed up development June 2013 Work on a significant geothermal project in Lampung in South Sumatra planned size 220 MW was suspended following local protests Local villagers in the Mount Rajabasa area claimed that development of the project would damage the social structure of the community The Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan sided with the local community saying that the company developing the site PT Supreme Energy would need to convince the local villagers of the safety of the project In response the chair of the Indonesian Geothermal Association said that the government should shut all geothermal projects if top officials were halfhearted in their commitment to investors August 2014 The Indonesian Parliament approved a new Geothermal Law aimed at facilitating development in the sector Key points of the new law included the following a Geothermal activities would no longer be considered mining activities development of geothermal resources can be carried out in forest conservation areas Under the existing Forestry Law mining operations are prohibited in protected forests b Tenders for geothermal projects will be called by the central government instead of by local administrations c New geothermal projects will be developed under new more favorable pricing arrangements d Local administrations will receive a portion of the revenues derived from geothermal resources e Quite detailed provisions were set out regarding such things as surveys of geothermal sites exploration tendering procedures the size of working areas arrangements for determining prices and administrative sanctions obligations of the holders of geothermal licenses and so on Policy issues Expansion in the sector appears to be being held back by a range of factors including an uncertain regulatory environment including especially uncertainty over land laws and the perceived risks of development The Indonesian Governments plans for development of the geothermal sector rely largely on private sector investment But numerous reports indicate that private sector investors are concerned about a range of risks including technical geological risks regulatory risks stemming from uncertain government policy and financial risks arising from the pricing policies determined by the Indonesian Government There is disagreement within the Indonesian Government as to who should bear these risks Policy makers in the power sector with an eye to meeting the governments official investment targets are often inclined to the view that at least some of the risks should be borne by the Indonesian Government through the national budget managed by the Ministry of Finance Official policy from the Ministry of Finance has traditionally been cautious resisting the suggestion that unspecified risks should be borne by the Indonesian budget In response to reports about certain of the risks that private sector investors were concerned about in mid2011 the government issued a regulation intended to provide guarantees that the state electricity utility PLN would meet financial obligations to independent power producers IPPs who invested in the geothermal sector But the regulation was quickly criticised by representatives of private investors as being too limited and for failing to clarify important concerns Pricing policy Prices have been another important policy issue in the sector In an effort to encourage private sector investment the Indonesian government has been establishing a feedin tariff scheme by instructing state electricity utility PLN to purchase power from geothermal projects at various rates ranging from around 65 US cents to over 12 US cents per kWh The government is also preparing a regulation that is expected to specify the price that the PLN must purchase power from geothermal plans in the second 10000 MW fasttrack electricity sector program which the government has announced this regulation is expected to be finalised by early 2012 Environmental issues According to the Ministry of Forestry around 80 of geothermal reserves are located in designated conserved forest areas The 2009 mineral and coal mining law lists geothermal exploration as a mining activity so a presidential decree would be required to allow geothermal activities conserved forest areas According to the ministry geothermal mining is unlikely to cause environmental harm In May 2011 the Indonesian government imposed a twoyear moratorium on logging However this excepts the energy sector including geothermal activities See also Renewable energy portal Indonesia portal List of power stations in Indonesia
