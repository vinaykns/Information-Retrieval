 This article is about the type of forest For other uses see Woodland disambiguation Woodland ˈwʊdlənd is a lowdensity forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests Conservationists have worked hard to preserve woodlands because people are destroying animals habitats when building homes and other buildings For example the woodlands in Northwest Indiana have been preserved as part of the Indiana Dunes Definitions United Kingdom Woodland is used in British woodland management to mean treecovered areas which arose naturally and which are then managed while forest is usually used in the British Isles to describe plantations usually more extensive or hunting Forests which are a land use with a legal definition and may not be wooded at all The term ancient woodland is used in British nature conservation to refer to any wooded land that has existed since 1600 and often though not always for thousands of years since the last Ice Age equivalent to the American term oldgrowth forest North America Woodlot is a closely related American term which refers to a stand of trees generally used for firewood While woodlots often technically have closed canopies they are so small that light penetration from the edge makes them ecologically closer to woodland than forest Australia In Australia a woodland is defined as an area with sparse 1030 cover of trees and an open woodland has very sparse 10 cover Woodlands are also subdivided into tall woodlands or low woodlands if their trees are over 30 m or under 10 m high respectively This contrasts with forests which have greater than 30 cover by trees
