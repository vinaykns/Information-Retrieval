 For other uses see Acid rain disambiguation Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions low pH It can have harmful effects on plants aquatic animals and infrastructure Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests freshwaters and soils killing insect and aquatic lifeforms causing paint to peel corrosion of steel structures such as bridges and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health Definition Acid rain is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet rain snow sleet fog cloudwater and dew and dry acidifying particles and gases acidic components Distilled water once carbon dioxide is removed has a neutral pH of 7 Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic and those with a pH greater than 7 are alkaline Clean or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH but usually no lower than 57 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid according to the following reaction Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of hydronium and carbonate ions However unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH acidity level A common example is nitric acid produced by electric discharge in the atmosphere such as lightning Acid deposition as an environmental issue discussed later in the article would include additional acids other than H2CO3 History The corrosive effect of polluted acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by John Evelyn who remarked upon the poor condition of the Arundel marbles Since the Industrial Revolution emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased In 1852 Robert Angus Smith was the first to show the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in Manchester England Though acidic rain was discovered in 1853 it was not until the late 1960s that scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon The term acid rain was coined in 1872 by Robert Angus Smith Canadian Harold Harvey was among the first to research a dead lake Public awareness of acid rain in the US increased in the 1970s after The New York Times published reports from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire of the myriad deleterious environmental effects shown to result from it Occasional pH readings in rain and fog water of well below 24 have been reported in industrialized areas Industrial acid rain is a substantial problem in China and Russia and areas downwind from them These areas all burn sulfurcontaining coal to generate heat and electricity The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth but has become more widespread The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local pollution has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition simply because of their higher rainfall An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in Scandinavia History of acid rain in the United States The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from Hubbard Brook Valley In 1972 a group of scientists including Gene Likens discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic The pH of the sample was measured to be 403 at Hubbard Brook The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study followed up with a series of research that analyzed the environmental effects of acid rain Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species In 1980 a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook New Hampshire and observed the change in species’ behaviors There was a decrease in species diversity an increase in community dominants and a decrease in the food web complexity In 1980 the US Congress passed an Acid Deposition Act This Act established an 18year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program NAPAP NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was and to determine longterm trends and established a network for dry deposition It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems historical buildings monuments and building materials It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs From the start policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts or to disparage those of their opponents For the US Governments scientific enterprise a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists program managers and the public In 1981 the National Academy of Sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US Reagan honored the agreement to Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau’s enforcement of antipollution regulation In 1982 US President Ronald Reagan commissioned William Nierenberg to sit on National Science Board Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to sit on a panel to draft a report on acid rain In 1983 the panel of scientists came up with a draft report which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reviewed the draft report and sent Fred Singer’s suggestions of the report which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nirenberg in April In May 1983 the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulfur emissions There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the Houses vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published In 1991 DENR provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States It reported that 5 of New England Lakes were acidic with sulfates being the most common problem They noted that 2 of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout and 6 of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems nitrogen saturation decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil episodic acidification regional haze and damage to historical monuments Meanwhile in 1989 the US Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act Title IV of these amendments established the Acid Rain Program a cap and trade system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO2 emissions from power plants It was implemented in two phases Phase I began in 1995 and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 87 million tons of sulfur dioxide One power plant in New England Merrimack was in Phase I Four other plants Newington Mount Tom Brayton Point and Salem Harbor were added under other provisions of the program Phase II began in 2000 and affects most of the power plants in the country During the 1990s research continued On March 10 2005 EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule CAIR This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO2 and NOx in the eastern United States When fully implemented CAIR will reduce SO2 emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70 and NOx emissions by over 60 from 2003 levels Overall the programs cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals Since the 1990s SO2 emissions have dropped 40 and according to the Pacific Research Institute acid rain levels have dropped 65 since 1976 Conventional regulation was used in the European Union which saw a decrease of over 70 in SO2 emissions during the same time period In 2007 total SO2 emissions were 89 million tons achieving the programs longterm goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010 the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be 1 billion to 2 billion a year only one fourth of what was originally predicted Forbes says In 2010 by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W Bush administration’s Clean Air Interstate Rule SO2 emissions had fallen to 51 million tons The term Citizen science can be traced back as far as January 1989 and a campaign by the Audubon Society to measure Acid rain Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the Wilson Center entitled Citizen Science and Policy A European Perspective a first use of the term citizen science by R Kerson in the magazine MIT Technology Review from January 1989 Quoting from the Wilson Center report The new form of engagement in science received the name citizen science The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989 describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acidrain awareness raising campaign The volunteers collected samples checked for acidity and reported back to the organization The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form nitric acid are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur containing compounds 70 TgS per year in the form of SO2 comes from fossil fuel combustion and industry 28 TgS from wildfires and 7–8 TgS per year from volcanoes Natural phenomena The principal natural phenomena that contribute acidproducing gases to the atmosphere are emissions from volcanoes Thus for example fumaroles from the Laguna Caliente crater of Poás Volcano create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog with acidity as high as a pH of 2 clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements Acidproducing gasses are also created by biological processes that occur on the land in wetlands and in the oceans The major biological source of sulfur containing compounds is dimethyl sulfide Nitric acid in rainwater is an important source of fixed nitrogen for plant life and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as lightning Acidic deposits have been detected in glacial ice thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe Soils of coniferous forests are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain Human activity The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources such as electricity generation factories and motor vehicles Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited In the past factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally thus factories now have taller smoke funnels However dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther causing widespread ecological damage Chemical processes Combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid Gas phase chemistry In the gas phase sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the hydroxyl radical via an intermolecular reaction which is followed by In the presence of water sulfur trioxide SO3 is converted rapidly to sulfuric acid Nitrogen dioxide reacts with OH to form nitric acid Chemistry in cloud droplets When clouds are present the loss rate of SO2 is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then like carbon dioxide hydrolyses in a series of equilibrium reactions There are a large number of aqueous reactions that oxidize sulfur from SIV to SVI leading to the formation of sulfuric acid The most important oxidation reactions are with ozone hydrogen peroxide and oxygen reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by iron and manganese in the cloud droplets Acid deposition Wet deposition Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation rain snow and so on removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earths surface This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops see aqueous phase chemistry above or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition Dry deposition Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60 of total acid deposition This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground plants or other surfaces Adverse effects Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests freshwaters and soils killing insect and aquatic lifeforms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health Surface waters and aquatic animals Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species including the brook trout in some lakes streams and creeks in geographically sensitive areas such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States However the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity ie depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed is variable The United States Environmental Protection Agencys EPA website states Of the lakes and streams surveyed acid rain caused acidity in 75 of the acidic lakes and about 50 of the acidic streams Soils Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed The enzymes of these microbes are denatured changed in shape so they no longer function by the acid The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize toxins such as aluminium and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations such as calcium and magnesium are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species such as sugar maple Acer saccharum Forests and other vegetation Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain like the acids effects on soil see above or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients In cultivated areas limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death Ocean Acidification Main article Ocean acidification Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans However acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their exoskeletons that they need to survive These coastal species link together as part of the oceans food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die Corals limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop because the calcium carbonate core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic low pH solutions Human health effects Acid rain does not directly affect human health The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects However the particulates responsible for acid rain sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides do have an adverse effect Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including asthma and bronchitis Other adverse effects Acid rain can damage buildings historic monuments and statues especially those made of rocks such as limestone and marble that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum which then flakes off The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible Acid rain also increases the corrosion rate of metals in particular iron steel copper and bronze Affected areas Places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia the eastern third of the United States and southeastern Canada Other affected areas include the southeastern coast of China and Taiwan Prevention methods Technical solutions Many coalfiring power stations use fluegas desulfurization FGD to remove sulfurcontaining gases from their stack gases For a typical coalfired power station FGD will remove 95 or more of the SO2 in the flue gases An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pHneutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber That is the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as gypsum when the purity of calcium sulfate is high In others they are placed in landfill However the effects of acid rain can last for generations as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to restore native life Fluidized bed combustion also reduces the amount of sulfur emitted by power production Vehicle emissions control reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles International treaties A number of international treaties on the longrange transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example the 1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions under the Convention on LongRange Transboundary Air Pollution Canada and the US signed the Air Quality Agreement in 1991 Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties Emissions trading Main article Emissions trading See also Acid Rain Program In this regulatory scheme every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits Operators can then install pollution control equipment and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide SO2 and nitrogen oxides NOx the primary causes of acid rain To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society the program employs both regulatory and market based
