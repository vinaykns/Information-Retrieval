Born March 13 1916 Jacque Fresco grew up in a Sephardi Jewish home in Bensonhurst in the Brooklyn borough of New York City Fresco was a teenager during the Great Depression Fresco spent time with friends discussing Charles Darwin Albert Einstein science and the future Fresco attended the Young Communist League After a discussion with the league president during a meeting Fresco was physically ejected after loudly stating that Karl Marx was wrong Fresco left home at the age of 14 hitchhiking and jumping trains as one of the socalled Wild Boys of the Road Fresco later turned his attention to technocracy Career Aircraft industry Fresco worked at Douglas Aircraft Company in California during the late 1930s He presented designs including a flying wing and a diskshaped aircraft Some of his designs were considered impractical at the time and Frescos design ideas were not adopted Fresco resigned from Douglas because of design disagreements In 1942 Fresco was drafted into the United States Army He was assigned technical design duties for the Army Air Force at Wright Field design laboratories in Dayton Ohio One design he produced was a radical variable camber wing with which he attempted to optimize flight control by allowing the pilot to adjust the thickness of the wings during lift and flight Fresco did not adjust to military life and was discharged Trend Home Fresco was commissioned by Earl Muntz to design housing that was low cost Muntz invested 500000 seed money in the project Fresco along with his associates Harry Giaretto and Eli Catran conceived designed and engineered a project house called the Trend Home Fresco 32 years old at the time came closest to traditional career success with this project Built mostly of aluminum and glass it was on prominent display at Stage 8 of the Warner Bros Sunset Lot in Hollywood for three months The home could be toured for one dollar with proceeds going to the Cancer Prevention Society In the summer of 1948 a Federal Housing Administration official met Muntz about the project The officials proposal according to Muntz would add a bureaucratic overhead negating the low production costs Without Federal or further private funding the project did not make mass production This experience led Fresco to the conclusion that society would have to be changed for his inventions to reach their potential Scientific Research Laboratories In the late 1940s Fresco created and was director of Scientific Research Laboratories in Los Angeles Here he also gave lectures and taught technical design meanwhile researching and working on inventions as a freelance inventor and scientific consultant During this period Fresco struggled to get his research funded and faced setbacks and financial difficulties In 1955 Fresco left California after his lab was removed to build the Golden State Freeway Midlife In 1955 Fresco moved to Miami Florida He opened a business as a psychological consultant but had no formal schooling in the subject Receiving a barrage of criticism from the American Psychological Association Fresco stopped that business In a newspaper article from that time period Fresco claimed to have a degree from Sierra University Los Angeles California which is unverified Fresco described white supremacist organizations he joined to test the feasibility of changing people He tells of joining a local Ku Klux Klan and White Citizens Council in an attempt to change their views about racial discrimination In Miami Fresco presented designs of a circular city Fresco made his living working as an industrial designer for various companies such as Alcoa and the Major Realty Corporation In 1961 with Pietro Belluschi and C Frederick Wise Fresco collaborated on a project known as the Sandwich House Consisting of mostly prefabricated components partitions and aluminum it sold for 2950 or 7500 with foundation and all internal installations During this period Fresco supported his projects by designing prefabricated aluminum devices through Jacque Fresco Enterprises Inc From 1955 to 1969 Fresco named his social ideas Project Americana Looking Forward Looking Forward was published in 1969 Author Ken Keyes Jr and Jacques Fresco coauthored the book Looking Forward is a speculative look at the future The authors picture an ideal cybernetic society in which want has been banished and work and personal possessions no longer exist individual gratification is the total concern Sociocyberneering Inc Fresco formed Sociocyberneering a membership organization claiming 250 members according to an interview with Fresco He hosted lectures in Miami Beach and Coral Gables Fresco promoted his organization by lecturing at universities and appearing on radio and television Although Fresco is presented as a Doctor on the Larry King show there is no evidence of that being the case Fresco did not complete high school Frescos sociocyberneering as a membership group was discontinued and land was purchased at another location in rural Venus Florida He established his home and research center there The Venus Project and later career Fresco with Meadows supported the project in the 1990s through freelance inventing industrial engineering conventional architectural modeling and invention consultations In 2002 Fresco published his main work The Best That Money Cant Buy In 2006 William Gazecki directed the semibiographical film about Fresco Future by Design In 2008 Peter Joseph featured Fresco in the film Zeitgeist Addendum where his ideas of the future were given as possible alternatives Peter Joseph founder of the Zeitgeist Movement began advocating Frescos approach In April 2012 the two groups disassociated due to disagreements regarding goals and objectives In 2010 Fresco attempted to trademark the phrase resourcebased economy The phrase was reviewed and found to be too generic and the trademark was denied Throughout 2010 Fresco traveled with Meadows worldwide to promote interest in the Venus Project On January 15 2011 Zeitgeist Moving Forward was released in theaters featuring Fresco In November 2011 Fresco spoke to protesters at the occupy Miami site at Government Center in Miami In April 2012 Roxanne Meadows released a film Paradise or Oblivion summarizing the goals and proposals of the Venus Project In June 2012 Maja Borg

assisted Fresco since 1976 As Frescos domestic partner and administrative colleague she oversees much of the management of the Venus Project Critical appraisals It’s a lack of professional engagement William Gazecki who in 2006 completed Future by Design a featurelength profile of Jacque Fresco says that has hurt Fresco the most “The real missing link in Jacque’s world is having put Jacque to work” Gazecki says “It’s exemplified when people say ‘Well show me some buildings he’s built And I don’t mean the domes out in Venus I mean let’s see an office building let’s see a manufacturing plant let’s see a circular city’ And that’s where he should have been 30 years ago He should have been applying his work in the real world … but he’s not a collaborator and I think that’s why he’s never had great public achievements” Fresco on Fresco when asked by a reporter why he has such difficulty actualizing his many ideas Fresco responded Because I cant get to anybody Views on Fresco Frescos critical view of modern economics has been compared to Thorstein Veblens concept of the predatory phase in human development according to an article in the journal of Society and Business Review Grønborg has labeled other facets of Frescos ideology a tabula rasa approach Synergetics theorist Arthur Coulter calls Frescos city designs organic and evolutionary rather than revolutionary Coulter posits such cities as the answer to Walter B Cannons idea of achieving homeostasis for society Hypothetical form of government Fresco describes his form of governance in this way The aims of The Venus Project have no parallel in history not with communism socialism fascism or any other political ideology This is true because cybernation is of recent origin With this system the system of financial influence and control will no longer exist Ludwig von Mises Institute scholar Robert P Murphy has raised the calculation problem against a resourcebased economy In a resourcebased economy Murphy claims there is no ability to calculate the availability and desirability of resources because the price mechanism is not utilized Addressing this aspect another article in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics states criticism of central plannings computation problem applies to the ideas of Fresco Question of utopianism The Venus Project states on its website states that it is not utopian Nikolina OlsenRule writing for the Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies supports this idea For most people the promise of the project sounds like an unattainable utopia but if you examine it more closely there are surprisingly many scientifically founded arguments that open up an entire new world of possibilities Morten Grønborg also of Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies points out the Venus Project is this visionary idea of a future society has many characteristics in common with the utopia the word utopia carries a double meaning since in Greek it can mean both the good place eutopia and the nonexisting place outopia A good place is precisely what Fresco has devoted his life to describing and fighting for Comments on Fresco HansUlrich Obrist notes Frescos future may of course seem outmoded and his writings have been subject to critique for their fascistic undertones of order and similitude but his contributions are etched in the popular psyche and his ecofriendly concepts continue to influence our present generation of progressive architects city planners and designers Frescos work gained the attention of science fiction enthusiast and critic Forrest J Ackerman Fresco would later attract Star Trek animator Doug Drexler who worked with Fresco to produce several computer renderings of his designs Commenting on Fresco physicist Paul G Hewitt wrote that Fresco inspired him toward a career in physical science Awards In July 2016 Jacque Fresco received a NOVUS Summit award for City DesignCommunity NOVUS Summit is supported by UN DESA United Nations
