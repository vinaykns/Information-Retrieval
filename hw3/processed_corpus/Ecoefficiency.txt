 Over the years as countries and regions around the world began to develop it slowly became evident that industrialization and economic growth come hand in hand with environmental degradation EcoEfficiency has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of sustainable development It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and pollution “It is measured as the ratio between the added value of what has been produced eg GDP and the added environment impacts of the product or service eg S02 emissions” The term was coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD in its 1992 publication “Changing Course” and at the 1992 Earth Summit ecoefficiency was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement Agenda 21 in the private sector Ergo the term has become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards sustainability combing ecological and economic efficiency History Although ecoefficiency is a rather new method the idea is not In the early 1970s Paul R Ehrlich and John Holdren developed the lettering formula I PAT to describe the impact of human activity on the environment Furthermore the concept of ecoefficiency was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in 1978 but it wasn’t until 1992 when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by Stephan Schmidheiny in ‘’Changing Course’’ Schmidheiny set out “to change the perception of industry as being part of the problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part—a key part—of the solution for sustainability and global development” The major drivers in the early phase of ecoefficiency’s development were the “forwardlooking managers and thinkers in 3M and Dow” It was their involvement which catapulted ecoefficiency from a brilliant idea to a workable concept The results of the WBCSD’s work creating the “linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in 1997 in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value” Methods According to the WBCSD definition ecoefficiency is achieved through the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity throughout the entire lifecycle to a level at least in line with the Earths estimated carrying capacity It works by implementing 4 main types of ratios The ratios may be applied to any unit comprising economic activities because such activities always relate to cost and value “and having some physical substrate always influence the environment” Furthermore there are two different levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios ‘’micro’’ and ‘’macro’’ There are three different methods to determine ecoefficiency at the microlevel First ‘’incremental ecoefficiency’’ which “specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects” Second an analysis method nicknamed ‘’winwin’’ which “gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies” It should be noted that the winwin micromethod is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance And the third is ‘’difference ecoefficiency’’ which is similar to the winwin variant but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives Now the macrolevel is much less defined and has shown less accurate results However “the ultimate aim of ecoefficiency analysis is to help move microlevel decision making into macrolevel optimality” The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macrolevel analysis at a countryworld scale There are two lifecycle assessment LCA based calculation systems on ecoefficiency the Analysis Method of BASF and the method of the Ecocosts value ratio of the Delft University of Technology Uses The reduction in ecological impacts translates into an increase in resource productivity which in turn can create a competitive advantage According to the WBCSD critical aspects of ecoefficiency are A reduction in the material intensity of goods or services A reduction in the energy intensity of goods or services Reduced dispersion of toxic materials Improved recyclability Maximum use of renewable resources Greater durability of products Increased service intensity of goods and services Strategies that have been linked to ecoefficiency include “Factor 4” and “Factor 10” which call for specific reductions in resource use “natural capitalism” which incorporates ecoefficiency as part of a broader strategy and the “cradletocradle” movement which claims to go beyond ecoefficiency in abolishing the very idea of waste According to Boulanger all versions of ecoefficiency share four key characteristics Confidence in technological innovation as the main solution to unsustainability Reliance on business as the principal actor of transformation The emphasis is on firms designing new products shifting to new production processes and investing in RD etc more than on the retailer or the consumer let alone the citizen Trust in markets if they are functioning well “Growthphilia” there is nothing wrong with growth as such The view that improvements in ecoefficiency are sufficient for achieving sustainability has been challenged by Huesemann and Huesemann who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution Moreover with “cradletocradle” growth is conducive to sustainability per se This broader concept is called ‘’Sustainable Production and Consumption’’ SPC “This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of natural resources” business has taken a key role in accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce Ecoefficiency is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of sustainable development making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues Examples Furthermore ecoefficiency is also a very useful tool because it can adapt and flex to be fit different sizes of companies while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies For example larger national players such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD 2002 European Commission EU 2005 European Environment Agency EEA and the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy NRTEE have all recognized that ecoefficiency is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives It has be proven to heighten market values for firms serve as an effective management tool for governments benefit civil society and increase quality of life “It does this by changing industrial processes creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules” More people aim to get more value for their money in the market while also enjoying a better environment Recently there has also been use of ecoefficiency in more nontraditional ways such as a use in banks to integrate environmental criteria into their creditapproval process looking at “ecointegrated economic risks of a customer” And is also being implemented as marketing advantages where “ecoefficient choices are always preferred” especially in service sectors such as tourism See also Ecoinnovation Sustainable Design Source reduction Industrial Ecology
