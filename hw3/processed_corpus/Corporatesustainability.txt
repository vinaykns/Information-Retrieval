 Corporate sustainability is a business approach that creates longterm consumer and employee value by creating a green strategy aimed toward the natural environment and taking into consideration every dimension of how a business operates in the social cultural and economic environment It also formulates strategies to build a company that fosters longevity through transparency and proper employee development Corporate sustainability is an evolution on more traditional phrases describing ethical corporate practice Phrases such as corporate social responsibility CSR or corporate citizenship continue to be used but are increasingly superseded by the broader term corporate sustainability Unlike phrases that focus on addedon policies corporate sustainability describes business practices built around social and environmental considerations The phrase is derived from two keys sources The Brundtland Commissions Report Our Common Future described sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs This desire to grow without damaging future generations prospects is becoming more and more central to business philosophies Within more academic management circles Elkington 1997 developed the concept of the Triple Bottom Line which proposed that business goals were inseparable from the societies and environments within which they operate Whilst shortterm economic gain could be chased a failure to account for social and environmental impacts would make those business practices unsustainable Measuring corporate sustainability is possible through composite indicators which aggregate environmental social corporate governance and economic measures eg Complex Performance Indicator CPI Strategy for corporate sustainability Business case for sustainability The challenge for many businesses in this new field is to quantify the positive impacts of sustainability Sustainability can increase revenue reduce energy expenses reduce waste expenses reduce materials and water expenses increase employee productivity reduce hiring and attrition expenses and reduce strategic and operational risks Furthermore sustainable business practices may attract talent and generate tax breaks Transparency Transparency deals with the idea that by having an engaging and open environment in the company as well as the community will improve performance and increase profits It is an open culture that promotes employee involvement in the innovation and creative processes Reaching out to the community creates a much bigger team is extremely cheap and provides evaluation from all angles Companies are looking inward and realizing changes must be made to fulfill environment needs such as energy efficiency limiting product waste and toxicity and designing innovative products One way for companies to accomplish this is through open communications with stakeholders characterized by high levels of information disclosure clarity and accuracy Stakeholder engagement Sustainability requires a company to look internally and externally to understand their environmental and social impacts This requires the engagement of stakeholders to understand impacts and concerns A business can address sustainability internally by educating employees and seeking to reduce impacts through waste reduction energy efficiency etc Employee engagement can be a powerful motivator by having a philanthropy committee or a green team As a company looks externally stakeholders include customers suppliers community and nongovernment organizations Thinking ahead Companies have adapted by implementing new creative ideas related to sustainability such as preparing upgraded technology that can transform the product rather than throwing away old materials New solutions that improve recycling and waste redirecting can ultimately reduce costs and increase profits For example WalMart has redirected more than 64 percent of the waste generated by stores and Sam’s Club facilities In 2009 alone they recycled more than 13 million pounds of aluminum 120 million pounds of plastics 116 million pounds of mixed paper and 46 billion pounds of cardboard Annually they expect to save around 20 million and prevent 38 million pounds of waste being sent to landfills
