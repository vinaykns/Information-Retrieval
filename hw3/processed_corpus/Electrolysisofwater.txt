 Electrolysis of water is the decomposition of water H2O into oxygen O2 and hydrogen gas H2 due to an electric current being passed through the water The reaction has a standard potential of −123 V meaning it ideally requires a potential difference of 123 volts to split water This technique can be used to make hydrogen fuel hydrogen gas and breathable oxygen though currently most industrial methods make hydrogen fuel from natural gas instead History Jan Rudolph Deiman and Adriaan Paets van Troostwijk used in 1789 an electrostatic machine to produce electricity which was discharged on gold electrodes in a Leyden jar with water In 1800 Alessandro Volta invented the voltaic pile and a few weeks later William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle used it for the electrolysis of water When Zénobe Gramme invented the Gramme machine in 1869 electrolysis of water became a cheap method for the production of hydrogen A method of industrial synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis was developed by Dmitry Lachinov in 1888 Principle A DC electrical power source is connected to two electrodes or two plates typically made from some inert metal such as platinum stainless steel or iridium which are placed in the water Hydrogen will appear at the cathode where electrons enter the water and oxygen will appear at the anode Assuming ideal faradaic efficiency the amount of hydrogen generated is twice the amount of oxygen and both are proportional to the total electrical charge conducted by the solution However in many cells competing side reactions occur resulting in different products and less than ideal faradaic efficiency Electrolysis of pure water requires excess energy in the form of overpotential to overcome various activation barriers Without the excess energy the electrolysis of pure water occurs very slowly or not at all This is in part due to the limited selfionization of water Pure water has an electrical conductivity about one millionth that of seawater Many electrolytic cells may also lack the requisite electrocatalysts The efficiency of electrolysis is increased through the addition of an electrolyte such as a salt an acid or a base and the use of electrocatalysts Currently the electrolytic process is rarely used in industrial applications since hydrogen can currently be produced more affordably from fossil fuels Equations In pure water at the negatively charged cathode a reduction reaction takes place with electrons e from the cathode being given to hydrogen cations to form hydrogen gas The half reaction balanced with acid is At the positively charged anode an oxidation reaction occurs generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit The same half reactions can also be balanced with base as listed below Not all half reactions must be balanced with acid or base Many do like the oxidation or reduction of water listed here To add half reactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen The number of hydrogen molecules produced is thus twice the number of oxygen molecules Assuming equal temperature and pressure for both gases the produced hydrogen gas has therefore twice the volume of the produced oxygen gas The number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number of generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated oxygen molecules Thermodynamics Decomposition of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen at standard temperature and pressure is not favorable in thermodynamic terms Thus the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell Ecell Ecathode − Eanode is −123 V at 25 °C at pH 0 H 10 M At 25 °C with pH 7 H 10×10 M the potential is unchanged based on the Nernst equation The thermodynamic standard cell potential can be obtained from standardstate free energy calculations to find ΔG° and then using the equation ΔG° nFE°where E° is the cell potential In practice when an electrochemical cell is driven toward completion by applying reasonable potential it is kinetically controlled Therefore activation energy ion mobility diffusion and concentration wire resistance surface hindrance including bubble formation causes electrode area blockage and entropy require a greater applied potential to overcome these factors Electrolyte selection If the above described processes occur in pure water H cations will accumulate at the cathode and OH anions will accumulate at the anode This can be verified by adding a pH indicator to the water the water near the cathode is acidic while the water near the anode is basic The negative hydroxide ions that approach the anode mostly combine with the positive hydronium ions H3O to form water The positive hydronium ions that approach the cathode mostly combine with negative hydroxide ions to form water Relatively few hydroniumhydroxide ions reach the cathodeanode This can cause a concentration overpotential at both electrodes Pure water is a fairly good insulator since it has a low autoionization Kw 10×10 at room temperature and thus pure water conducts current poorly 0055 µS·cm Unless a very large potential is applied to cause an increase in the autoionization of water the electrolysis of pure water proceeds very slowly limited by the overall conductivity If a watersoluble electrolyte is added the conductivity of the water rises considerably The electrolyte disassociates into cations and anions the anions rush towards the anode and neutralize the buildup of positively charged H there similarly the cations rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of negatively charged OH there This allows the continued flow of electricity Care must be taken in choosing an electrolyte since an anion from the electrolyte is in competition with the hydroxide ions to give up an electron An electrolyte anion with less standard electrode potential than hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide and no oxygen gas will be produced A cation with a greater standard electrode potential than a hydrogen ion will be reduced in its stead and no hydrogen gas will be produced The following cations have lower electrode potential than H and are therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cations Li Rb K Cs Ba Sr Ca Na and Mg Sodium and lithium are frequently used as they form inexpensive soluble salts If an acid is used as the electrolyte the cation is H and there is no competitor for the H created by disassociating water The most commonly used anion is sulfate SO2− 4 as it is very difficult to oxidize with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the peroxydisulfate ion being −205 volts Strong acids such as sulfuric acid H2SO4 and strong bases such as potassium hydroxide KOH and sodium hydroxide NaOH are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities A solid polymer electrolyte can also be used such as Nafion and when applied with a special catalyst on each side of the membrane can efficiently split the water molecule with as little as 15 Volts There are also a number of other solid electrolyte systems that have been trialled and developed with a number of electrolysis systems now available commercially that use solid electrolytes Techniques Main article Water splitting Fundamental demonstration Two leads running from the terminals of a battery are placed in a cup of water with a quantity of electrolyte to establish conductivity in the solution Using NaCl table salt in an electrolyte solution results in chlorine gas rather than oxygen due to a competing halfreaction With the correct electrodes and correct electrolyte such as baking soda sodium bicarbonate hydrogen and oxygen gases will stream from the oppositely charged electrodes Oxygen will collect at the positively charged electrode anode and hydrogen will collect at the negatively charged electrode cathode Note that hydrogen is positively charged in the H2O molecule so it ends up at the negative electrode And vice versa for oxygen Note that an aqueous solution of water with chloride ions when electrolysed will result in either OH if the concentration of Cl is low or in chlorine gas being preferentially discharged if the concentration of Cl is greater than 25 by mass in the solution Hofmann voltameter Main article Hofmann voltameter The Hofmann voltameter is often used as a smallscale electrolytic cell It consists of three joined upright cylinders The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte A platinum electrode is placed at the bottom of each of the two side cylinders connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of electricity When current is run through the Hofmann voltameter gaseous oxygen forms at the anode positive and gaseous hydrogen at the cathode negative Each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes where it can be drawn off with a stopcock Industrial Many industrial electrolysis cells are very similar to Hofmann voltameters with complex platinum plates or honeycombs as electrodes Generally the only time hydrogen is intentionally produced from electrolysis is for specific point of use application such as is the case with oxyhydrogen torches or when extremely high purity hydrogen or oxygen is desired The vast majority of hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons and as a result contains trace amounts of carbon monoxide among other impurities The carbon monoxide impurity can be detrimental to various systems including many fuel cells High pressure Main article High pressure electrolysis High pressure electrolysis is the electrolysis of water with a compressed hydrogen output around 120–200 Bar 1740–2900 psi By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3 Hightemperature Main article Hightemperature electrolysis Hightemperature electrolysis also HTE or steam electrolysis is a method currently being investigated for water electrolysis with a heat engine High temperature electrolysis may be preferable to traditional roomtemperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat which is cheaper than electricity and because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures Alkaline water Main article Alkaline water electrolysis Polymer electrolyte membrane Main article Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis Nickeliron In 2014 researchers announced an electrolysis system made of inexpensive abundant nickel and iron rather than precious metal catalysts such as platinum or iridium The nickelmetalnickeloxide structure is more active than pure nickel metal or pure nickel oxide alone The catalyst significantly lowers the required voltage Applications About five percent of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is created by electrolysis The majority of this hydrogen produced through electrolysis is a side product in the production of chlorine and caustic soda This is a prime example of a competing side reaction The electrolysis of brine saltwater a water sodium chloride mixture is only half the electrolysis of water since the chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine rather than water being oxidized to oxygen The hydrogen produced from this process is either burned converting it back to water used for the production of specialty chemicals or various other smallscale applications Water electrolysis is also used to generate oxygen for the International Space Station Hydrogen may later be used in a fuel cell as a storage method of energy and water Efficiency Industrial output Efficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen MJm assuming standard temperature and pressure of the H2 The lower the energy used by a generator the higher would be its efficiency a 100efficient electrolyser would consume 394 kilowatthours per kilogram 142 MJkg of hydrogen 12749 joules per litre 1275 MJm Practical electrolysis using a rotating electrolyser at 15 bar pressure may consume 50 kilowatthours per kilogram 180 MJkg and a further 15 kilowatthours 54 MJ if the hydrogen is compressed for use in hydrogen cars Electrolyser vendors provide efficiencies based on enthalpy To assess the claimed efficiency of an electrolyser it is important to establish how it was defined by the vendor ie what enthalpy value what current density etc There are two main technologies available on the market alkaline and proton exchange membrane PEM electrolysers Alkaline electrolysers are cheaper in terms of investment they generally use nickel catalysts but less efficient PEM electrolysers conversely are more expensive they generally use expensive platinumgroup metal catalysts but are more efficient and can operate at higher current densities and can therefore be possibly cheaper if the hydrogen production is large enough Reported working efficiencies were for alkaline in 1996 lying in the 50–60 range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65–70 for the larger plants Theorical efficiency for PEM electrolysers are predicted up to 94 Ranges in 2014 were 43–67 for the alkaline and 40–67 for the PEM they should progress in 2030 to 53–70 for the alkaline and 62–74 for the PEM Overpotential Real water electrolysers require higher voltages for the reaction to proceed The part that exceeds 123 V is called overpotential or overvoltage and represents any kind of loss and nonideality in the electrochemical process For a well designed cell the largest overpotential is the reaction overpotential for the fourelectron oxidation of water to oxygen at the anode electrocatalysts can facilitate this reaction and platinum alloys are the state of the art for this oxidation Developing a cheap effective electrocatalyst for this reaction would be a great advance and is a topic of current research there are many approaches among them a 30yearold recipe for molybdenum sulfide graphene quantum dots carbon nanotubes perovskite and nickelnickeloxide The simpler twoelectron reaction to produce hydrogen at the cathode can be electrocatalyzed with almost no overpotential by platinum or in theory a hydrogenase enzyme If other less effective materials are used for the cathode eg graphite large overpotentials will appear Thermodynamics The electrolysis of water in standard conditions requires a theoretical minimum of 237 kJ of electrical energy input to dissociate each mole of water which is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of water It also requires energy to overcome the change in entropy of the reaction Therefore the process cannot proceed below 286 kJ per mol if no external heatenergy is added Since each mole of water requires two moles of electrons and given that the Faraday constant F represents the charge of a mole of electrons 96485 Cmol it follows that the minimum voltage necessary for electrolysis is about 123 V If electrolysis is carried out at high temperature this voltage reduces This effectively allows the electrolyser to operate at more than 100 electrical efficiency In electrochemical systems this means that heat must be supplied to the reactor to sustain the reaction In this way thermal energy can be used for part of the electrolysis energy requirement In a similar way the required voltage can be reduced below 1 V if fuels such as carbon alcohol biomass are reacted with water PEM based electrolyzer in low temperature or oxygen ions solid oxide electrolyte based electrolyzer in high temperature This results in some of the fuels energy being used to assist the electrolysis process and can reduce the overall cost of hydrogen produced However observing the entropy component and other losses voltages over 148 V are required for the reaction to proceed at practical current densities the thermoneutral voltage In the case of water electrolysis Gibbs free energy represents the minimum work necessary for the reaction to proceed and the reaction enthalpy is the amount of energy both work and heat that has to be provided so the reaction products are at the same temperature as the reactant ie standard temperature for the values given above Potentially an electrolyser operating at 148 V would be 100 efficient See also Electrochemistry Electrochemical engineering Electrolysis Hydrogen production Noryl Gas cracker
