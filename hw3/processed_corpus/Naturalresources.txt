 Primary resource redirects here For original sources used in research see Primary source Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic gravitational and electrical properties and forces On earth it includes sunlight atmosphere water land includes all minerals along with all vegetation and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances Particular areas such as the rainforest in FatuHiva are often characterized by the biodiversity and geodiversity existent in their ecosystems Natural resources may be further classified in different ways Natural resources are materials and components something that can be used that can be found within the environment Every manmade product is composed of natural resources at its fundamental level A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as fresh water air and as well as a living organism such as a fish or it may exist in an alternate form that must be processed to obtain the resource such as metal ores petroleum and most forms of energy There is much debate worldwide over natural resource allocations this is particularly true during periods of increasing scarcity and shortages depletion and overconsumption of resources but also because the exportation of natural resources is the basis for many economies particularly for developed countries Some natural resources such as sunlight and air can be found everywhere and are known as ubiquitous resources However most resources only occur in small sporadic areas and are referred to as localised resources There are very few resources that are considered inexhaustible will not run out in foreseeable future – these are solar radiation geothermal energy and air though access to clean air may not be The vast majority of resources are theoretically exhaustible which means they have a finite quantity and can be depleted if managed improperly Classification There are various methods of categorizing natural resources these include source of origin stage of development and by their renewability On the basis of origin natural resources may be divided into two types Biotic — Biotic resources are obtained from the biosphere living and organic material such as forests and animals and the materials that can be obtained from them Fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter Abiotic – Abiotic resources are those that come from nonliving nonorganic material Examples of abiotic resources include land fresh water air and heavy metals including ores such as gold iron copper silver etc Considering their stage of development natural resources may be referred to in the following ways Potential resources — Potential resources are those that exist in a region and may be used in the future For example petroleum occurs with sedimentary rocks in various regions but until the time it is actually drilled out and put into use it remains a potential resource Actual resources — Actual resources are those that have been surveyed their quantity and quality determined and are being used in present times The development of an actual resource such as wood processing depends upon the technology available and the cost involved Reserve resources — The part of an actual resource which can be developed profitably in the future is called a reserve resource Stock resources — Stock resources are those that have been surveyed but cannot be used by organisms due to lack of technology For example hydrogen Renewability is a very popular topic and many natural resources can be categorized as either renewable or nonrenewable Renewable resources — Renewable resources can be replenished naturally Some of these resources like sunlight air wind water etc are continuously available and their quantity is not noticeably affected by human consumption Though many renewable resources do not have such a rapid recovery rate these resources are susceptible to depletion by overuse Resources from a human use perspective are classified as renewable only so long as the rate of replenishmentrecovery exceeds that of the rate of consumptionAnd they can replenish easily compared to Nonrenewable resources Nonrenewable resources – Nonrenewable resources either form slowly or do not naturally form in the environment Minerals are the most common resource included in this category By the human perspective resources are nonrenewable when their rate of consumption exceeds the rate of replenishmentrecovery a good example of this are fossil fuels which are in this category because their rate of formation is extremely slow potentially millions of years meaning they are considered nonrenewable Some resources actually naturally deplete in amount without human interference the most notable of these being radioactive elements such as uranium which naturally decay into heavy metals Of these the metallic minerals can be reused by recycling them but coal and petroleum cannot be recycled Once they are completely used they take millions of years to replenish Extraction See also Mining Resource extraction involves any activity that withdraws resources from nature This can range in scale from the traditional use of preindustrial societies to global industry Extractive industries are along with agriculture the basis of the primary sector of the economy Extraction produces raw material which is then processed to add value Examples of extractive industries are hunting trapping mining oil and gas drilling and forestry Natural resources can add substantial amounts to a countrys wealth however a sudden inflow of money caused by a resource boom can create social problems including inflation harming other industries Dutch disease and corruption leading to inequality and underdevelopment this is known as the resource curse Extractive industries represent a large growing activity in many lessdeveloped countries but the wealth generated does not always lead to sustainable and inclusive growth Extractive industry businesses often are assumed to be interested only in maximizing their shortterm value implying that lessdeveloped countries are vulnerable to powerful corporations Alternatively host governments are often assumed to be only maximizing immediate revenue Researchers argue there are areas of common interest where development goals and business cross These present opportunities for international governmental agencies to engage with the private sector and host governments through revenue management and expenditure accountability infrastructure development employment creation skills and enterprise development and impacts on children especially girls and women Depletion See also Exploitation of natural resources In recent years the depletion of natural resources has become a major focus of governments and organizations such as the United Nations UN This is evident in the UNs Agenda 21 Section Two which outlines the necessary steps to be taken by countries to sustain their natural resources The depletion of natural resources is considered to be a sustainable development issue The term sustainable development has many interpretations most notably the Brundtland Commissions to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs however in broad terms it is balancing the needs of the planets people and species now and in the future In regards to natural resources depletion is of concern for sustainable development as it has the ability to degrade current environments and potential to impact the needs of future generations The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem Unless we solve that problem it will avail us little to solve all others Theodore Roosevelt Depletion of natural resources is associated with social inequity Considering most biodiversity are located in developing countries depletion of this resource could result in losses of ecosystem services for these countries Some view this depletion as a major source of social unrest and conflicts in developing nations At present with it being the year of the forest there is particular concern for rainforest regions which hold most of the Earths biodiversity According to Nelson deforestation and degradation affect 85 of the worlds forests with 30 of the Earths surface already cropped If we consider that 80 of people rely on medicines obtained from plants and ¾ of the worlds prescription medicines have ingredients taken from plants loss of the worlds rainforests could result in a loss of finding more potential life saving medicines The depletion of natural resources is caused by direct drivers of change such as Mining petroleum extraction fishing and forestry as well as indirect drivers of change such as demography economy society politics and technology The current practice of Agriculture is another factor causing depletion of natural resources For example the depletion of nutrients in the soil due to excessive use of nitrogen and desertification The depletion of natural resources is a continuing concern for society This is seen in the cited quote given by Theodore Roosevelt a wellknown conservationist and former United States president who was opposed to unregulated natural resource extraction Protection See also Environmental protection In 1982 the UN developed the World Charter for Nature which recognized the need to protect nature from further depletion due to human activity It states that measures need to be taken at all societal levels from international to individual to protect nature It outlines the need for sustainable use of natural resources and suggests that the protection of resources should be incorporated into national and international systems of law To look at the importance of protecting natural resources further the World Ethic of Sustainability developed by the IUCN WWF and the UNEP in 1990 set out eight values for sustainability including the need to protect natural resources from depletion Since the development of these documents many measures have been taken to protect natural resources including establishment of the scientific field and practice of conservation biology and habitat conservation respectively Conservation biology is the scientific study of the nature and status of Earths biodiversity with the aim of protecting species their habitats and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on science economics and the practice of natural resource management The term conservation biology was introduced as the title of a conference held at the University of California San Diego in La Jolla California in 1978 organized by biologists Bruce A Wilcox and Michael E Soulé Habitat conservation is a land management practice that seeks to conserve protect and restore habitat areas for wild plants and animals especially conservation reliant species and prevent their extinction fragmentation or reduction in range Management Main article Natural resource management Natural resource management is a discipline in the management of natural resources such as land water soil plants and animals with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generationsHence sustainable development can be followed where there is a judicial use of resources which compromises the needs of the present generations as well as the future generations Management of natural resources involves identifying who has the right to use the resources and who does not for defining the boundaries of the resource The resources are managed by the users according to the rules governing of when and how the resource is used depending on local condition A successful management of natural resources should engage the community because of the nature of the shared resources the individuals who are affected by the rules can participate in setting or changing them The users have rights to devise their own management institutions and plans under the recognition by the government The right to resources includes land water fisheries and pastoral rights The users or parties accountable to the users have to actively monitor and ensure the utilisation of the resource compliance with the rules and to impose penalty on those peoples who violates the rules These conflicts are resolved in a quick and low cost manner by the local institution according to the seriousness and context of the offence The global sciencebased platform to discuss natural resources management is the World Resources Forum based in Switzerland See also Conservation ethic Environmental movement Sustainable development References Further reading Batey Blackman Sue Anne Baumol William J 2008 Natural Resources In David R Henderson ed Concise Encyclopedia of Economics 2nd
