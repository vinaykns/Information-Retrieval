 Not to be confused with ecological economics Environmental economics is a subfield of economics that is concerned with environmental issues Quoting from the National Bureau of Economic Research Environmental Economics program Environmental Economics undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution water quality toxic substances solid waste and global warming Environmental economics is distinguished from ecological economics in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving natural capital One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought with ecological economists emphasizing strong sustainability and rejecting the proposition that natural capital can be substituted by humanmade capital Topics and concepts Market failure Central to environmental economics is the concept of market failure Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently As stated by Hanley Shogren and White 2007 in their textbook Environmental Economics A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off Common forms of market failure include externalities nonexcludability and nonrivalry Externality An externality exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price An externality can be positive or negative but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics For instance water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor Or a firm emitting pollution will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others As a result pollution may occur in excess of the socially efficient level which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution A classic definition influenced by Kenneth Arrow and James Meade is provided by Heller and Starrett 1976 who define an externality as “a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of Pareto efficiency” In economic terminology externalities are examples of market failures in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome Common goods and public goods When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource the resource is either called a common property resource when there is rivalry for the resource such that one persons use of the resource reduces others opportunity to use the resource or a public good when use of the resource is nonrivalrous In either case of nonexclusion market allocation is likely to be inefficient These challenges have long been recognized Hardins 1968 concept of the tragedy of the commons popularized the challenges involved in nonexclusion and common property Commons refers to the environmental asset itself common property resource or common pool resource refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams and openaccess implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons they can end up expending too much effort over harvesting a resource eg a fishery Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions users of an openaccess resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights leading to environmental degradation See however Ostroms 1990 work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish selfgoverning rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons The mitigation of climate change effects is an example of a public good where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both nonrival and nonexcludable Such efforts are nonrival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys They are nonexcludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded A countrys incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can free ride off the efforts of other countries Over a century ago Swedish economist Knut Wicksell 1896 first discussed how public goods can be underprovided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES CRITICAL FOR LIFE Nitrogen Cycle Water Cycle Carbon Cycle Oxygen Cycle Valuation Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from natural resources or ecosystem services see the nature section of ecological economics Nonuse values include existence option and bequest values For example some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services The existence of these species may have an option value as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose certain plants may be researched for drugs Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior such as the cost of taking recreational trips or using hedonic methods in which values are estimated based on observed prices Nonuse values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as contingent valuation or choice modelling Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment willingness to pay or their willingness to accept WTA compensation for the destruction of the environmental good Hedonic pricing examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices traveling expenses and payments to visit parks Solutions Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include Environmental regulations Under this plan the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator Usually this is done using costbenefit analysis There is a growing realization that regulations also known as command and control instruments are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics Eg1 regulations are enforced by fines which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed Eg2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods however is the total cost of the regulation Command and control regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions Some firms in this system can abate inexpensively while others can only abate at high cost Because of this the total abatement has some expensive and some inexpensive efforts to abate Consequently modern Command and control regulations are oftentimes designed in a way which addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters For instance CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint US system or average vehicle weight EU system of their entire vehicle fleet Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first then the more expensive methods second Eg as said earlier trading in the quota system means a firm only abates if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole Quotas on pollution Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of tradeable emissions permits which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost In theory if such tradeable quotas are allowed then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction In practice tradeable permits approaches have had some success such as the USs sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems Taxes and tariffs on pollutionRemoval of dirty subsidies Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting and will provide a dynamic incentive that is the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially optimal level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society for example in form of greater production exceeds the costs Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution the socalled green tax shift Better defined property rights The Coase Theorem states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution regardless of who receives them if transaction costs are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited For example if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water or the factory had the right to pollute then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute Or citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if government itself did not act an early example of bioregional democracy Many markets for pollution rights have been created in the late twentieth century—see emissions trading Relationship to other fields Environmental economics is related to ecological economics but there are differences Most environmental economists have been trained as economists They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems many of which are related to socalled market failures—circumstances wherein the invisible hand of economics is unreliable Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services and vice versa This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of ecology Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to environmental problems and focuses more explicitly on longterm environmental sustainability and issues of scale Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a price system ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use money as a primary arbiter of decisions These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings Another context in which externalities apply is when globalization permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with biodiversity to undercut prices of another who is creating a race to the bottom in regulations and conservation This in turn may cause loss of natural capital with consequent erosion water purity problems diseases desertification and other outcomes which are not efficient in an economic sense This concern is related to the subfield of sustainable development and its political relation the antiglobalization movement Environmental economics was once distinct from resource economics Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks But resource managers and policymakers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources eg values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation externalities associated with mining It is now difficult to distinguish environmental and natural resource economics as separate fields as the two became associated with sustainability Many of the more radical green economists split off to work on an alternate political economy Environmental economics was a major influence for the theories of natural capitalism and environmental finance which could be said to be two subbranches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production and the value of biodiversity to humans respectively The theory of natural capitalism Hawken Lovins Lovins goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with physical capital The more radical Green economists reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new political economy beyond capitalism or communism that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment acknowledging that economy is threefifths of ecology Mike Nickerson These more radical approaches would imply changes to money supply and likely also a bioregional democracy so that political economic and ecological environmental limits were all aligned and not subject to the arbitrage normally possible under capitalism An emerging subfield of environmental economics studies its intersection with development economics Dubbed envirodevonomics by Michael Greenstone and B Kelsey Jack in their paper Envirodevonomics A Research Agenda for a Young Field the subfield is primarily interested in studying why environmental quality is so poor in developing countries A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a countrys GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics including market failures externalities and willingness to pay may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries such as political issues lack of infrastructure or inadequate financing tools among many others
