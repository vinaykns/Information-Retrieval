 CH4 redirects here For other uses see CH4 disambiguation For the emergency service protocol see ETHANE Methane US ˈmɛθeɪn or UK ˈmiːθeɪn is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CH4 one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen It is a group 14 hydride and the simplest alkane and is the main constituent of natural gas The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an attractive fuel though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure Natural methane is found both below ground and under the sea floor When it reaches the surface and the atmosphere it is known as atmospheric methane The Earths atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150 since 1750 and it accounts for 20 of the total radiative forcing from all of the longlived and globally mixed greenhouse gases these gases dont include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect History In November 1776 methane was first scientifically identified by Italian physicist Alessandro Volta in the marshes of Lake Maggiore straddling Italy and Switzerland Volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by Benjamin Franklin about flammable air Volta collected the gas rising from the marsh and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas He also demonstrated that the gas could be ignited with an electric spark The name methane was coined in 1866 by the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann The name was derived from methanol Properties and bonding Methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent C–H bonds Its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals MOs resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on C and H The lowest energy MO is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the inphase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms Above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of MOs that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen The resulting threeoverone bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements At room temperature and standard pressure methane is a colorless odorless gas The familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant usually blends containing tertbutylthiol as a safety measure Methane has a boiling point of −161 °C −2578 °F at a pressure of one atmosphere As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations 54–17 in air at standard pressure Solid methane exists in several modifications Presently nine are known Cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane I This substance crystallizes in the cubic system space group Fm3m The positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane I ie methane molecules may rotate freely Therefore it is a plastic crystal Chemical reactions The primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion steam reforming to syngas and halogenation In general methane reactions are difficult to control Partial oxidation to methanol for example is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen The enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane but cannot be used for industrialscale reactions Acidbase reactions Like other hydrocarbons methane is a very weak acid Its pKa in DMSO is estimated to be 56 It cannot be deprotonated in solution but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known A variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed mostly as unstable species in lowpressure gas mixtures These include methenium or methyl cation CH 3 methane cation CH 4 and methanium or protonated methane CH 5 Some of these have been detected in outer space Methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids Cations with higher charge such as CH2 6 and CH3 7 have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable Despite the strength of its C–H bonds there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate C–H bond activation in methane and other lower numbered alkanes Combustion Methanes heat of combustion is 555 MJkg Combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction The following equations are part of the process with the net result being CH4 2 O2 → CO2 2 H2O ΔH −891 k Jmol at standard conditions CH4 M → CH3 H M CH4 O2 → CH3 HO2 CH4 HO2 → CH3 2 OH CH4 OH → CH3 H2O O2 H → O OH CH4 O → CH3 OH CH3 O2 → CH2O OH CH2O O → CHO OH CH2O OH → CHO H2O CH2O H → CHO H2 CHO O → CO OH CHO OH → CO H2O CHO H → CO H2 H2 O → H OH H2 OH → H H2O CO OH → CO2 H H OH M → H2O M H H M → H2 M H O2 M → HO2 M The species M signifies an energetic third body from which energy is transferred during a molecular collision Formaldehyde HCHO or H 2CO is an early intermediate reaction 7 Oxidation of formaldehyde gives the formyl radical HCO reactions 8–10 which then give carbon monoxide CO reactions 11 12 13 Any resulting H2 oxidizes to H2O or other intermediates reaction 14 15 Finally the CO oxidizes forming CO2 reaction 16 In the final stages reactions 17–19 energy is transferred back to other third bodies The overall speed of reaction is a function of the concentration of the various entities during the combustion process The higher the temperature the greater the concentration of radical species and the more rapid the combustion process Reactions with halogens Given appropriate conditions methane reacts with halogens as follows where X is a halogen fluorine F chlorine Cl bromine Br or iodine I This mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation It is initiated with UV light or some other radical initiator A chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride The resulting methyl radical CH3• can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride CH3Cl and a chlorine atom This chlorine atom can then react with another methane or methyl chloride molecule repeating the chlorination cycle Similar reactions can produce dichloromethane CH2Cl2 chloroform CHCl3 and ultimately carbon tetrachloride CCl4 depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio Uses Methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid liquefied natural gas or LNG While leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air Gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas of which methane is the principal component Fuel Methane is used as a fuel for ovens homes water heaters kilns automobiles turbines and other things It combusts with oxygen to create fire Natural gas Main article natural gas Methane is important for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released At about 891 kJmol methanes heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion 891 kJmol to the molecular mass 160 gmol of which 120 gmol is carbon shows that methane being the simplest hydrocarbon produces more heat per mass unit 557 kJg than other complex hydrocarbons In many cities methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking In this context it is usually known as natural gas which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter or 1000 BTU per standard cubic foot Methane in the form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as gasolinepetrol and diesel Research into adsorption methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted Liquefied natural gas Main article Liquefied natural gas Liquefied natural gas LNG is natural gas predominantly methane CH4 that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport Liquefied natural gas takes up about 1600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state It is odorless colorless nontoxic and noncorrosive Hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state freezing and asphyxia The liquefaction process involves removal of certain components such as dust acid gases helium water and heavy hydrocarbons which could cause difficulty downstream The natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure maximum transport pressure set at around 25 kPa or 36 psi by cooling it to approximately −162 °C −260 °F LNG achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas CNG so that the energy density of LNG is 24 times greater than that of CNG or 60 that of diesel fuel This makes LNG cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist Specially designed cryogenic sea vessels LNG carriers or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport LNG when it is not highly refined for special uses is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas It is also beginning to be used in LNGfueled road vehicles For example trucks in commercial operation have been achieving payback periods of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in LNG equipment on the trucks and LNG infrastructure to support fueling However it remains more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas As of 2002 the relatively higher cost of LNG production and the need to store LNG in more expensive cryogenic tanks had slowed widespread commercial use Liquid methane rocket fuel In a highly refined form liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel Though methane has been investigated for decades no production methane engines have yet been used on orbital spaceflights Methane is reported to offer the advantage over Kerosene of depositing less carbon on the internal parts of rocket motors reducing the difficulty of reuse of boosters Since the 1990s a number of Russian rockets using liquid methane have been proposed One 1990s Russian engine proposal was the RD192 a methaneLOX variant of the RD191 In 2005 US companies Orbitech and XCOR Aerospace developed a demonstration liquid oxygenliquid methane rocket engine and a larger 7500 poundsforce 33 kNthrust engine in 2007 for potential use as the CEV lunar return engine before the CEV program was later cancelled More recently the American private space company SpaceX announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines including initially the very large Raptor rocket engine Raptor is being designed to produce 44 meganewtons 1000000 lbf of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse Isp of 363 seconds and a sealevel Isp of 321 seconds and began componentlevel testing in 2014 In February 2014 the Raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable fullflow staged combustion cycle type where both propellant streams—oxidizer and fuel—are completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber Prior to 2014 only two fullflow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle In 2016 a development Raptor engine was tested In October 2013 the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation a stateowned contractor for the Chinese space program announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new LOX methane rocket engine No engine size was provided In September 2014 another American private space company—Blue Origin— publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine The new engine the Blue Engine 4 or BE4 has been designed to produce 2400 kilonewtons 550000 lbf of thrust While initially planned to be used exclusively on a Blue Origin proprietary launch vehicle it will now be used on a new United Launch Alliance ULA engine on a new launch vehicle that is a successor to the Atlas V ULA indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019 One advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solarsystem body in particular using methane production from local materials found on Mars or Titan providing fuel for a return journey By 2013 NASAs Project Morpheus had developed a small restartable LOX methane rocket engine with 5000 poundsforce 22 kN thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers Small LOX methane thrusters 5–15 poundsforce 22–67 N were also developed suitable for use in a Reaction Control System RCS SpaceNews is reporting in early 2015 that the French space agency CNES is working with Germany and a few other governments and will propose a LOXmethane engine on a reusable launch vehicle by mid2015 with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026 Chemical feedstock Although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds the only practical processes are relatively unselective In the chemical industry methane is converted to synthesis gas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by steam reforming This endergonic process requiring energy utilizes nickel catalysts and requires high temperatures around 700–1100 °C Related chemistries are exploited in the HaberBosch Synthesis of ammonia from air which is reduced with natural gas to a mixture of carbon dioxide water and ammonia Methane is also subjected to freeradical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes although methanol is a more typical precursor Other commercially viable processes that use methane as a chemical feedstock include the catalytic oxidation of methane into methanol based on the oxidative coupling of methane and the direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide to produce methanesulfonic acid Production Biological routes Main article methanogenesis Naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by microbial methanogenesis This multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source The net reaction is The final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme CoenzymeB sulfoethylthiotransferase Methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill ruminants eg cattle and the guts of termites It is uncertain if plants are a source of methane emissions Industrial routes There are many technological methane production methods Methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas A more synthetic method to produce methane is hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the Sabatier process Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the FischerTropsch process which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer chain molecules than methane Example of large scale coaltomethane gasification is the Great Plains Synfuels plant started in 1984 in Beulah North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low grade lignite a resource which is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight ash content low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport Methane as natural gas has been so abundant that synthetic production of it has been limited to special cases and as of 2016 covers only minor fraction of the methane used Power to methane Main article Power to gas § Power to methane Power to methane is a technology which uses electrical power to produce hydrogen from water by electrolysis and uses the Sabatier reaction to combine hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane As of 2016 this is mostly under development and not in large scale use Theoretically the process could be used as a buffer for excess and offpeak power generated by highly fluctuating wind generators and solar arrays The conversion efficiency of power to methane is 4965 and full powermethanepower cycle is 30–38 Laboratory synthesis Methane can be produced by the destructive distillation of acetic acid in the presence of soda lime or similar Acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process Methane can be prepared from aluminium carbide by reaction with water or strong acids It is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder giving water and ferrous chloride as byproducts On Mars Methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future Mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet via in situ resource utilization An adaptation of the Sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on Mars utilizing water from the Martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere Methane could also be produced by a nonbiological process called serpentinization involving water carbon dioxide and the mineral olivine which is known to be common on Mars Occurrence Methane was discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from Lake Maggiore It is the major component of natural gas about 87 by volume The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source see Coal bed methane extraction a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from nonmineable coal seams It is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen Methane is produced at shallow levels low pressure by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the Earths surface In general the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil Methane is generally transported in bulk by pipeline in its natural gas form or LNG carriers in its liquefied form few countries transport it by truck Alternative sources Apart from gas fields an alternative method of obtaining methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure wastewater sludge municipal solid waste including landfills or any other biodegradable feedstock under anaerobic conditions Rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth Methane hydratesclathrates icelike combinations of methane and water on the sea floor found in vast quantities are a potential future source of methane Cattle belch methane accounts for 16 of the worlds annual methane emissions to the atmosphere One study reported that the livestock sector in general primarily cattle chickens and pigs produces 37 of all humaninduced methane Early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants A 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate at least 51 of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of livestock products meaning all meat dairy and byproducts and their transportation More recently a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of humaninduced methane and 145 percent of humaninduced greenhouse gas emissions Many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy Paleoclimatology research published in Current Biology suggests that flatulence from dinosaurs may have warmed the Earth Atmospheric methane Main article Atmospheric methane Methane is created near the Earths surface primarily by microorganisms by the process of methanogenesis It is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics Uncontrolled buildup of methane in the atmosphere is naturally checked – although human influence can upset this natural regulation – by methanes reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor It has a net lifetime of about 10 years and is primarily removed by conversion to carbon dioxide and water In addition there is a large but unknown amount of methane in methane clathrates in the ocean floors as well as the Earths crust In 2010 methane levels in the Arctic were measured at 1850 nmolmol a level over twice as high as at any time in the 400000 years prior to the industrial revolution Historically methane concentrations in the worlds atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmolmol during glacial periods commonly known as ice ages and between 600 and 700 nmolmol during the warm interglacial periods Recent research suggests that the Earths oceans are a potentially important new source of Arctic methane Methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 compared to CO2 over a 100year period and 72 over a 20year period The Earths atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150 since 1750 and it accounts for 20 of the total radiative forcing from all of the longlived and globally mixed greenhouse gases these gases dont include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect Clathrates Methane is essentially insoluble in water but it can be trapped in ice forming a similar solid Significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth at large depths Arctic methane release from permafrost and methane clathrates is an expected consequence and further cause of global warming Anaerobic oxidation of methane There is a group of bacteria that drive methane oxidation with nitrite as the oxidant the anaerobic oxidation of methane Safety Methane is nontoxic yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers halogen and some halogencontaining compounds Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16 by displacement as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21 to 16 without ill effects The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5–15 concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture Methane offgas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building Methane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters A methane gas explosion was the cause of the Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster in West Virginia on April 5 2010 killing 25 Extraterrestrial methane Methane has been detected or is believed to exist on all planets of the solar system and most of the larger moons With the possible exception of Mars it is believed to have come from abiotic processes Mercury – the tenuous atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane Venus – the atmosphere contains a large amount of methane from 60 km 37 mi to the surface according to data collected by the Pioneer Venus Large Probe Neutral Mass Spectrometer Moon – traces are outgassed from the surface Mars – the Martian atmosphere contains 10 nmolmol methane The source of methane on Mars has not been determined Recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes fault lines or methanogens that it may be a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms or that it may be the result of UV radiation In January 2009 NASA scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface Studies of a Weather Research and Forecasting model for Mars MarsWRF and related Mars general circulation model MGCM suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers which is within the roving capabilities of future Mars rovers The Curiosity rover which landed on Mars in August 2012 can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane but even if the mission determines that microscopic Martian life is the source of the methane it probably resides far below the surface beyond the rovers reach Curiositys Sample Analysis at Mars SAM instrument is capable of tracking the presence of methane over time to determine if it is constant variable seasonal or random providing further clues about its source The first measurements with the Tunable Laser Spectrometer TLS indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site The Mars Trace Gas Mission orbiter planned for launch in 2016 would further study Mars methane and its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol Alternatively these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means such as serpentinization On July 19 2013 NASA scientists reported finding not much methane ie an upper limit of 27 parts per billion of methane around the Gale Crater where the Curiosity rover landed in August 2012 On September 19 2013 from further measurements by Curiosity NASA scientists reported no detection of atmospheric methane with a value of 6999180000000000000♠018±067 ppbv corresponding to an upper limit of only 13 ppbv 95 confidence limit and as a result concluded that the probability of current methanogenic microbial activity on Mars is reduced On 16 December 2014 NASA reported the Curiosity rover detected a tenfold spike likely localized in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere Sample measurements taken a dozen times over 20 months showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014 averaging 7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere Before and after that readings averaged around onetenth that level Saturn – the atmosphere contains 4500 ± 2000 ppm methane Enceladus – the atmosphere contains 17 methane Iapetus Titan – the atmosphere contains 16 methane and thousands of methane lakes have been detected on the surface In the upper atmosphere methane is converted into more complex molecules including acetylene a process that also produces molecular hydrogen There is evidence that acetylene and hydrogen are recycled into methane near the surface This suggests the presence either of an exotic catalyst possibly an unknown form of methanogenic life Methane showers probably prompted by changing seasons have also been observed On October 24 2014 methane was found in polar clouds on Titan Uranus – the atmosphere contains 23 methane Ariel – methane is believed to be a constituent of Ariels surface ice Miranda Oberon – about 20 of Oberons surface ice is composed of methanerelated carbonnitrogen compounds Titania – about 20 of Titanias surface ice is composed of methanerelated organic compounds Umbriel – methane is a constituent of Umbriels surface ice Neptune – the atmosphere contains 15 ± 05 methane Triton – Triton has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere with small amounts of methane near the surface Pluto – spectroscopic analysis of Plutos surface reveals it to contain traces of methane Charon – methane is believed present on Charon but it is not completely confirmed Eris – infrared light from the object revealed the presence of methane ice Halleys Comet Comet Hyakutake – terrestrial observations found ethane and methane in the comet Extrasolar planets – methane was detected on extrasolar planet HD 189733b this is the first detection of an organic compound on a planet outside the solar system Its origin is unknown since the planets high temperature 700 °C would normally favor the formation of carbon monoxide instead Research indicates that meteoroids slamming against exoplanet atmospheres could add hydrocarbon gases such as methane making the exoplanets look as though they are inhabited by life even if they are not Interstellar clouds The atmospheres of
